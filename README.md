# warren-court-language-model
A language modeling project analyzing the decisions of the Warren Court.

This was a solo project that was more about fiddling and discovery than it was about creating a product, so the folder is really messy.

Currently migrating the project from previous location to GitHub. Afterwards I plan on making it a bit more readable for public presentation.
