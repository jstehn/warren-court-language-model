States Supreme Court\nADAMS v. CHURCH(1904)\nNo. 169\nArgued: March 3, 1904Decided: March 21, 1904\n\n\n\n This is an appeal from a decree of the circuit court of Malheur county, state of Oregon, entered by direction of the supreme court of Oregon. \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n The action originated in a suit by Steel against Adams to settle the affairs of a copartnership theretofore carried on by the parties, and, so far as a Federal question is concerned, involves the right of the plaintiff below to have conveyed to him an interest in a certain tract of land, acquired by Adams under the timber culture act, before the formation of the partnership. 20 Stat. at L. 113, chap. 190. The defendant denies that this tract of land was included in the partnership property. Upon appeal to the supreme court of Oregon, upon whose direction the decree was entered, it was found that at the time of the formation of the partnership Adams was the owner of a timber culture claim covering the land in controversy, and the contention of the plaintiff that it was agreed and understood at the time of forming the partnership that such claim should be conveyed to and become a part of the assets of the firm as soon as Adams should acquire title from the government was sustained.\n The Federal question made is that such agreement is void as against the statutes and policy of the United States.\n Messrs. R. J. Slater and Will R. King for plaintiff in error. \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alonzo H. Stewart and Joseph Simon for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day: \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The finding of facts made in the supreme court of Oregon is binding upon this court and will be the basis of decision here. Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300; Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 38 L. ed. 305, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452.\n It appears that Adams made the entry under the timber culture act before the partnership agreement was entered into, and there is nothing in the record to show that, in taking the preliminary oath required by the statute, he acted otherwise than in good faith, and stated the truth as to the situation and his purpose in making the entry. As recited in the title, the purpose of the act is to encourage the growth of timber on the Western prairies, and it is intended to induce settlers to plant and cultivate trees with a view to receiving a patent of the lands thus improved. Section 2 of the act (20 Stat. at L. 113, chap. 190) requires the person applying for the benefit of the law to \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n make affidavit that he is the head of a family (or over twenty-one years of age) and a citizen of the United States, or has declared his intention to become such; that the land specified is devoid of timber; that the entry is made for the cultivation of timber for the exclusive use and benefit of the applicant; that the application is made in good faith, and not for the purpose of speculation, or directly or indirectly for the use or benefit of any other person or persons whomsoever; that affiant intends to hold and cultivate the land and to comply with the provisions of the act, and has not made other entry under the law. Before a final certificate can be given or patent issue, eight years must elapse from the date of entry, and if, at the expiration of that time, or within five years thereafter, the person making the entry, or, in event of death, his heir or legal representative, shall prove by two credible witnesses that he, she, or they have planted, and for not less than eight years have cultivated and protected, the required quantity and character of trees; that not less than twenty-seven hundred trees were planted on each acre, and that at the time of making such proof there shall be then growing six hundred and seventy-five living and thrifty trees on each acre, a patent shall issue for the land.\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that these provisions demonstrate the policy of the law to grant the lands in question to the person filing the entry, his heirs and legal representatives, and none other; and that to make the sale of an interest in the lands to another as a partner, as is found to have been done in this case, is void as against public policy. It is pointed out that the final affidavit, required by the rules and regulations of the General Land Office, made under authority of  5 of the act, is to be in the same terms as the preliminary one, and requires the claimant to make oath that his entry was made in good faith, and not for the purpose of speculation or indirectly for the benefit of any other person whomsoever.\n This requirement and the general purpose indicated in the \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n terms of the act, it is argued, bring the case within the reasoning and spirit of Anderson v. Carking, \n135 U.S. 483\n, 34 L. ed. 272, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905. In that case it was held that a court of equity would not grant a decree for specific performance of an agreement to sell the interest of the homesteader, made after settlement and before the oath is filed for final certificate. But the homestead act specifically requires that the applicant shall make affidavit before entry is made that it is for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, and not directly or indirectly for the use or benefit of any other person. Rev. Stat.  2290 ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1389).\n Further, the final proof requires affidavit by the applicant 'that no part of such land has been alienated except as provided in  2288 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1385).' Rev. Stat.  2291 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1390), which section limits the right of alienation to 'church, cemetery, or school purposes, or for the right of way for railroads.'\n In this state of the law, this court, in the Anderson Case, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brewer, sustained the contention in behalf of Anderson 'that the homestead is a gift from the government to the homesteader, conditioned upon his occupation for five years, and upon his making no disposition or alienation during such term; that the affidavit of nonalienation is as clear an expression of the legislative intent as a direct prohibition; that the whole policy of government in this respect would be thwarted if the homesteader were permitted to alienate prior to the expiration of the five years; that a successful alienation could be accomplished only by perjury, and an attempted alienation would only offer a constant inducement to the homesteader to abandon his occupation, and thus deprive the purchaser of any possibility of acquiring title to the land; that a contract whose consummation necessarily rests on perjury is illegal.' And that courts of equity would not enforce the performance of such contracts 'founded upon perjury and entered into in defiance of a clearly expressed will of the government.' But this case is very far from supporting the contention of the plaintiff in error as to the construction of the timber culture act. There is no requirement in the latter \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n act that the entryman shall make oath that he has not alienated any interest in the land. The policy of the government to require such affidavit when it intends to make it a condition precedent to granting a title was indicated in the homestead act, and could readily have been pursued by a similar provision in the timber culture act if it was intended to extend the principle to that statute. The final proof under the latter act has in view sworn testimony that the number of trees required has been planted, and the prairies theretofore barren of timber have been supplied with trees to the extent required by the law before the title shall pass from the government. The policy of the homestead act, no less than in the specific statement in the final oath, looks to a holding for a term of years by an actual settler with a view to acquiring a home for himself. In encouragement of such settlers, and none others, homesteads have been freely granted by the government.\n This conclusion is in conformity with the decisions of the Land Department in Sims v. Busse, 4 Land Dec. 309, and United States v. Read, 5 Land Dec. 313. In these cases the right of the timber culture entryman to dispose of his holding, acquired by him in good faith, before the final certificate, is fully recognized. It is argued that, conceding these decisions to hold that such entryman can sell his claim after entry and before final proof, it does not follow that he can sell it and agree to prove up the entry claim and obtain a patent with a promise to convey it to another, without violating the policy of the law. But as the law does not require affidavit before final certificate that no interest in the land has been sold, we perceive no reason why such contract as was found to exist by the supreme court of Oregon would vitiate the agreement to convey after the certificate is granted and the patent issued. If the entryman has complied with the statute and made the entry in good faith, in accordance with the terms of the law and the oath required of him upon making such entry, and has done nothing inconsistent with the terms of the law, we find nothing in the fact that, during his term of occupancy, he has \n\n[193 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n agreed to convey an interest, to be conveyed after patent issued, which will defeat his claim and forfeit the right acquired by planting the trees and complying with the terms of the law. Had Congress intended such result to follow from the alienation of an interest after entry in good faith, it would have so declared in the law. Myers v. Craft, 13 Wall. 291, 20 L. ed. 562.\n To sustain the contentions of the plaintiff in error would be to incorporate, by judicial decision, a prohibition against the alienation of an interest in the lands, not found in the statute or required by the policy of the law upon the subject.\n The decree of the state court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADAMS v. PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK(1904)\nNo. 504\nArgued: January 27, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 585, 586]\n\u00a0\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the state of New York. The plaintiff in error at the April term, 1903, of the supreme court of the state of New York, was tried before one of the justices of that court and a jury, and convicted of the crime of having in his possession, knowingly, certain gambling paraphernalia used in the game commonly known as policy, in violation of  344a of the Penal Code of the state of New York. This section and the one following,  344b, relating to the offense in question, are as follows:\n Sec. 344a. Keeping Place to Play Policy-'A person who keeps, occupies, or uses, or permits to be kept, occupied, or used, a place, building, room, table, establishment, or apparatus for policy playing, or for the sale of what are commonly called 'lottery policies,' or who delivers or receives money or other valuable consideration in playing policy, or in aiding in the playing thereof, or for what is commonly called a 'lottery policy,' or for any writing, paper, or document in the nature of a bet, wager, or insurance upon the drawing or drawn numbers of any public or private lottery; or who shall have in his possession, knowingly, any writing, paper, or document, representing or being a record of any chance, share, or interest in numbers sold, drawn, or to be drawn, or in what is commonly called 'policy,' or in the nature of a bet, wager, or insurance, upon the drawing or drawn numbers of any public or private lottery, or any paper, print, writing, numbers, device, policy slip, or article of any kind such as is commonly used in carrying on, promoting, or playing the game commonly called 'policy;' or who is the owner, agent, superintendent, janitor, or caretaker of any place, building, or room where policy play- \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 587]\n\u00a0\n ing or the sale of what are commonly called 'lottery policies' is carried on with his knowledge, or, after notification that the premises are so used, permits such use to be continued, or who aids, assists, or abets in any manner, in any of the offenses, acts, or matters herein named, is a common gambler and punishable by imprisonment for not more than two years, and in the discretion of the court, by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both.'\n Sec. 344b. Possession of Policy Slip, etc., Presumptive Evidence.- 'The possession, by any person other than a public officer, of any writing, paper, or document representing or being a record of any chance, share, or interest in numbers sold, drawn, or to be drawn, or in what is commonly called 'policy,' or in the nature of a bet, wager, or insurance upon the drawing or drawn numbers of any public or private lottery, or any paper, print, writing, numbers, or device, policy slip, or article of any kind, such as is commonly used in carrying on, promoting, or playing the game commonly called 'policy,' is presumptive evidence of possession thereof knowingly and in violation of the provisions of  344.\n The assignments of error in this court are:\n'First. That the court erred in holding that by the reception in evidence of the defendant's private papers seized in the raid of his premises, against his protest and without his consent, which had no relation whatsoever to the game of policy, for the possession of papers used in connection with which said game he was convicted, his constitutional right to be secure in his person, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures was not violated, and that he was also thereby not compelled to be a witness against himself, in contravention of the 4th, 5th, and 14th Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'Second. That the court erred in holding that the statute,  344a, 344b, of the Penal Code of the state of New York, under which the indictment against the plaintiff in error was found, and his conviction was had, did not deprive him of rights, privileges, and immunities secured to other citizens of \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 588]\n\u00a0\n the United States and of said state of New York, nor of liberty or property, without due process of law, nor of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of  1 of the 14th Article of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'Third. That the court erred in affirming the judgment of conviction, and in refusing to discharge the plaintiff in error from custody.'\n\n The game of policy referred to in the sections of the statute quoted is a lottery scheme carried on, as shown in the testimony, by means of certain numbers procured at the shop or place where the game is played, and consists in an attempt to guess whether one or more of the series held by the player will be included in a list of twelve or at times thirteen of the numbers between one and seventy-eight, which are supposed to be drawn daily at the headquarters of the operators of the game. A person desiring to play the game causes the numbers to be entered on series of slips or manifold sheets. One of these pieces of paper containing the combination played by the person entering the game is kept by him and is known as a policy slip. Drawings are held twice a day, and the holder of the successful combination receives the money which goes to the winner of the game. About 3,500 of these slips were found in the office occupied by the plaintiff in error, which was searched by certain police officers holding a search warrant. The officers took not only the policy slips, but certain other papers, which were received in evidence against the plaintiff in error at the trial, against his objection, for the purpose of identifying certain handwriting of the defendant upon the slips, and also to show that the papers belonged to the defendant, and were in the same custody as the policy slips.\n So far as the case presents a Federal question, the court of appeals of the state of New York held (176 N. Y. 351, 68 N. E. 636) that the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States do not contain limitations upon the power of the states, and proceeded to examine the case in the light of similar provisions in the Constitution and Bill of Rights of that state. \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 589]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. Laflin Kellogg and Alfred C. Pett e for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 585, 591]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard S. Gans and William Travers Jerome for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 585, 594]\n\u00a0\n We do not feel called upon to discuss the contention that the 14th Amendment has made the provisions of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, so far as they relate to the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures and protect them against being compelled to testify in a criminal case against themselves, privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States of which they may not be deprived by the action of the states. An examination of this record convinces us that there has been no violation of these constitutional restrictions, either in an unreasonable search or seizure, or in compelling the plaintiff in error to testify against himself.\n No objection was taken at the trial to the introduction of the testimony of the officers holding the search warrant as to the seizure of the policy slips; the objection raised was to receiving in evidence certain private papers. These papers became important as tending to show the custody by the plaintiff in error, with knowledge, of the policy slips. The question was not made in the attempt to resist an unlawful seizure of the private papers of the plaintiff in error, but arose upon objection to the introduction of testimony clearly competent as tending to establish the guilt of the accused of the offense charged. In such cases the weight of authority as well as reason limits the inquiry to the competency of the proffered testimony, and the courts do not stop to inquire as to the means by which the evidence was obtained. The rule is thus laid down in Greenleaf (vol. 1,  254a): \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 595]\n\u00a0\n 'It may be mentioned in this place that though papers and other subjects of evidence may have been illegally taken from the possession of the party against whom they are offered, or otherwise unlawfully obtained, this is no valid objection to their admissibility if they are pertinent to the issue. The court will not take notice how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully, nor will it form an issue to determine that question.'\n The author is supported by numerous cases. Of them, perhaps, the leading one is Com. v. Dana, 2 Met. 329, in which the opinion was given by Mr. Justice Wilde, in the course of which he said:\n'There is another conclusive answer to all these objections. Admitting that the lottery tickets and materials were illegally seized, still this is no legal objection to the admission of them in evidence. If the search warrant were illegal, or if the officer serving the warrant exceeded his authority, the party on whose complaint the warrant issued, or the officer, would be responsible for the wrong done; but this is no good reason for excluding the papers seized as evidence if they were pertinent to the issue, as they unquestionably were. When papers are offered in evidence the court can take no notice how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully; nor would they form a collateral issue to determine that question. This point was decided in the cases of Legatt v. Tollervey, 14 East, 302, and Jordan v. Lewis, 14 East, 306, note, and we are entirely satisfied that the principle on which these cases were decided is sound and well established.'\n\n This principle has been repeatedly affirmed in subsequent cases by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts; among others, Com. v. Tibbetts, 157 Mass. 519, 32 N. E. 910. In that case a police officer, armed with a search warrant calling for a search for intoxicating liquors upon the premises of the defendant's husband, took two letters which he found at the time. Of the competency of this testimony the court said:\n'But two points have been argued. The first is that the criminatory articles and letters found by the officer in the defendant's possession were not admissible in evidence because \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 596]\n\u00a0\n the officer had no warrant to search for them, and his only authority was under a warrant to search her husband's premises for intoxicating liquors. The defendant contends that under such circumstances the finding of criminatory articles or papers can only be proved when, by express provision of statute, the possession of them is itself made criminal. This ground of distinction is untenable. Evidence which is pertinent to the issue is admissible, although it may have been procured in an irregular, or even in an illegal, manner. A trespasser may testify to pertinent facts observed by him, or may put in evidence pertinent articles or papers found by him while trespassing. For the trespass he may be held responsible civilly, and perhaps criminally, but his testimony is not thereby rendered incompetent.' Com. v. Acton, 165 Mass. 11, 42 N. E. 329; Com. v. Smith, 166 Mass. 370, 44 N. E. 503.\n\n To the same effect are Chastang v. State, 83 Ala. 29, 3 So. 304; State v. Flynn, 36 N. H. 64. In the latter case it was held:\n'Evidence obtained by means of a search warrant is not inadmissible, either upon the ground that it is in the nature of admissions made under duress or that it is evidence which the defendant has been compelled to trade and commerce; that the evidence has been unfairly or illegally obtained, even if it appears that the search warrant was illegally issued.'\n\n State v. Edwards, 51 W. Va. 220, 59 L. R. A. 465, 41 S. E. 429; Shields v. State, 104 Ala. 35, 16 So. 85; Bacon v. United States, 38 C. C. A. 31, 97 Fed. 35; State v. Atkinson, 40 S. C. 363, 18 S. E. 1021; Williams v. State, 100 Ga. 511, 39 L. R. A. 269, 28 S. E. 624; State v. Pomeroy, 130 Mo. 489, 32 S. W. 1002; Gindrat v. People, 138 Ill. 103, 27 N. E. 1085; Trask v. People, 151 Ill. 523, 38 N. E. 248; Starchman v. State, 62 Ark. 538, 36 S. W. 940.\n In this court it has been held that if a person is brought within the jurisdiction of one state from another, or from a foreign country, by the unlawful use of force, which would render the officer liable to a civil action or in a criminal proceeding because of the forcible abduction, such fact would not prevent the trial of the person thus abducted in the state wherein he had committed an offense. Ker v. Illinois, \n119 U.S. 436\n, 30 L. ed. 421, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225; Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 700\n, 32 L. ed. 283, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204. The case most relied upon in argument by plaintiff in error is the leading one of \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 597]\n\u00a0\n Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. In that case a section of the customs and revenue laws of the United States authorized the court in revenue cases, on motion of the government's attorney, to require the production by the defendant of certain books, records, and papers in court, otherwise the allegation of the government's attorney as to their contents to be taken as true. It was held that the act was unconstitutional and void as applied to a suit for a penalty or a forfeiture of the party's goods. The case has been frequently cited by this court and we have no wish to detract from its authority. That case presents the question whether one can be compelled to produce his books and papers in a suit which seeks the forfeiture of his estate on pain of having the statements of government's counsel as to the contents thereof taken as true and used as testimony for the government. The court held, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Bradley, that such procedure was in violation of both the 4th and 5th Amendments; the Chief Justice and Justice Miller held that the compulsory production of such documents did not come within the terms of the 4th Amendment as an unreasonable search or seizure, but concurred with the majority in holding that the law was in violation of the 5th Amendment. This case has been cited and distinguished in many of the cases from the state courts which we have had occasion to examine.\n The supreme court of the state of New York, before which the defendant was tried, was not called upon to issue process or make any order calling for the production of the private papers of the accused, nor was there any question presented as to the liability of the officer for the wrongful seizure, or of the plaintiff in error's right to resist with force the unlawful conduct of the officer, but the question solely was, Were the papers found in the execution of the search warrant, which had a legal purpose in the attempt to find gambling paraphernalia, competent evidence against the accused? We think there was no violation of the constitutional guaranty of privilege from unlawful search or seizure in the admission of this testimony. Nor do we think the accused was compelled to incriminate himself. He did not take the witness stand in his \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 598]\n\u00a0\n own behalf, as was his privilege under the laws of the state of New York. He was not compelled to testify concerning the papers or make any admission about them.\n The origin of these amendments is elaborately considered in Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion in the Boyd Case, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. The security intended to be guaranteed by the 4th Amendment against wrongful search and seizures is designed to prevent violations of private security in person and property and unlawful invasion of the sanctity of the home of the citizen by officers of the law, acting under legislative or judicial sanction, and to give remedy against such usurpations when attempted. But the English, and nearly all of the American, cases, have declined to extend this doctrine to the extent of excluding testimony which has been obtained by such means, if it is otherwise competent. In Boyd's Case the law held unconstitutional virtually compelled the defendant to furnish testimony against himself in a suit to forfeit his estate, and ran counter to both the 4th and 5th Amendments. The right to issue a search warrant to discover stolen property or the means of committing crimes is too long established to require discussion. The right of seizure of lottery tickets and gambling devices, such as policy slips, under such warrants, requires no argument to sustain it at this day. But the contention is that, if, in the search for the instruments of crime, other papers are taken, the same may not be given in evidence. As an illustration,-if a search warrant is issued for stolen property, and burglars' tools be discovered and seized, they are to be excluded from testimony by force of these amendments. We think they were never intended to have that effect, but are rather designed to protect against compulsory testimony from a defendant against himself in a criminal trial, and to punish wrongful invasion of the home of the citizen or the unwarranted seizure of his papers and property, and to render invalid legislation or judicial procedure having such effect.\n It is further urged that the law of the state of New York ( 344b) which makes the possession by persons other than a public officer of papers or documents, being the record of chances or slips in what is commonly known as \n\n[192 U.S. 585, 599]\n\u00a0\n policy, or policy slips, or the possession of any paper, print, or writing commonly used in playing or promoting the game of policy, presumption of possession thereof knowingly, in violation of  344a, is a violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it deprives a citizen of his liberty and property without due process of law. We fail to perceive any force in this argument. The policy slips are property of an unusual character, and not likely, particularly in large quantities, to be found in the possession of innocent parties. Like other gambling paraphernalia, their possession indicates their use or intended use, and may well raise some inference against their possessor, in the absence of explanation. Such is the effect of this statute. Innocent persons would have no trouble in explaining the possession of these tickets, and in any event the possession is only prima facie evidence, and the party is permitted to produce such testimony as will show the truth concerning the possession of the slips. Furthermore, it is within the established power of the state to prescribe the evidence which is to be received in the courts of its own government. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n-729, 37 L. ed. 905-918, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016\n\n\n It is argued, lastly, that  344b is unconstitutional because the possession of the policy tickets is presumptive evidence against all except public officers, and it is urged that public officials, from the governor to notaries public, would thus be excluded from the terms of the law which apply to all nonofficial persons. This provision was evidently put into the statute for the purpose of excluding the presumption raised by possession where such tickets or slips are seized and are in the custody of officers of the law. This was the construction given to the act by the New York courts, and is the only one consistent with its purposes. The construction suggested would lead to a manifest absurdity, which has not received, and is not likely to receive, judicial sanction. We find nothing in the record before us to warrant a reversal of the conclusions reached in the New York Court of Appeals, and its judgment will be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAH HOW v. U S(1904)\nNo. 307\nArgued: January 12, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Terence J. McManus, Frank S. Black, Russell H. Landale, and Max J. Kohler for appellants.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for appellee.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 65, 75]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are appeals from judgments of the United States district court confirming decisions of a commissioner, and adjudging that the appellants be removed from the United States to China. Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 U.S. 193\n, 46 L. ed. 1121, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. The commissioner decided that each of the appellants was a Chinese laborer found without certificate of residence, as required by law, within the United States, and was not entitled to remain within the United States. The facts may be summed up as follows: The appellants were arrested in July, 1902, when working in laundries, they all having failed to produce certificates of residence when called upon to do so by the Chinese inspector. At the hearing before the commissioner they offered testimony of witnesses other than Chinese that they were residents of the United States on May 5, 1892. Ah How and Chu Do put in evidence that they were not laborers. Yung Lee offered evidence of illness, which he contended made him unable to procure his certificate. Chu Do offered parol evidence that he was born in the United States, and therefore was a citizen, and also that he was a minor during the time allowed by the statute for obtaining a certificate. Lew Guey offered similar evidence and a certificate of another United States commissioner of a hearing before him and an adjudication that Lew Guey had the right to remain in the United States by reason of being a citizen thereof. The United States offered no evidence beyond the facts stated above.\n The ground of appeal common to all the cases is that  3 \n\n[193 U.S. 65, 76]\n\u00a0\n and 6 of the act of May 5, 1892, 27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1319), have been repealed. By  3 any Chinese person arrested under the provisions of the act shall be adjudged to be unlawfully within the United States unless he shall establish by affirmative proof, to the satisfaction of the judge or commissioner, his right to remain. Of course, if the burden of proof was on the appellants, the commissioner and judge might not be satisfied by the affirmative evidence produced. We are not asked to review the finding of fact. See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 714\n, 715 S., 37 L. ed. 905, 913, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016. But it is argued that this section is done away with by  1 of the act of April 29, 1902, chap. 641, 32 Stat. at L. 176,1 continuing all laws then in force, 'so far as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations.' It is said that the section is inconsistent with article 4 of the treaty of December 8, 1894, 28 Stat. at L. 1210, agreeing that Chinese laborers, or Chinese of any other class, either permanently or temporarily residing in the United States, shall have, for the protection of their persons and property, all rights that are given by the laws of the United States to citizens of the most favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens. It is pointed out that the treaty of 1894 with Japan [29 Stat. at L. 848] and the treaty of 1859 with Paraguay [12 Stat. at L. 1087] give the rights and privileges of native citizens to the subjects of those countries in access to the courts and in the defense of their rights, and it is said that the law as to the burden of proof cuts down those privileges and rights. The section has been upheld, however, by this court, since the treaty, and after the passage of the act. Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1121, 1125, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891; United States v. Lee Yen Tai, \n185 U.S. 213\n, 46 L. ed 878, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 629. It is not repealed by the laws of 1902. The clause of the treaty had a different object, and in view of the difficulties encountered in such an investigation, it could not have been supposed to promise that special measures theretofore taken should not be continued in force for the purpose of ascertaining the very question whether the laborers were lawfully residing in the United States or not. See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 730\n, 37 S. L. ed. 905, 919, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016. But it is enough to say that the treaty itself, in article 5, expressly refers to the act of 1892 as \n\n[193 U.S. 65, 77]\n\u00a0\n amended by the act of 1893, and states that the Chinese government will not object to the enforcement of those acts.\n It follows still more clearly from the language of article 5 of the treaty, that  6, as amended by the act of November 3, 1893, 28 Stat. at L. 7, chap. 14 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1322), remains in force. Lee Lung v. Patterson, \n186 \nU.S. 168, 176\n, 177 S., 46 L. ed. 1108, 1111, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 795. That section requires Chinese laborers who are entitled to remain in the United States to obtain a certificate of residence from the collector of internal revenue of their district, or to be deported, subject to certain excuses. Article 5 of the treaty especially refers to the requirement of registration in the acts of 1892 and 1893, although, as we have said, it states that the enforcement of the acts as a whole will not be objected to. In one or two of the cases there was a suggestion below that  6 of the act was unconstitutional, but that question was disposed of in Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 37 L. ed. 905, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016, and was not pressed.\n The complaints are objected to as insufficient, because, in addition to alleging that the appellants are laborers not entitled to remain in the United States without certificates, it adds the words 'having come unlawfully into the United States without certificates,' thus implying, it is said, that an unlawful coming into the United States could be legalized by obtaining a certificate. It is enough to say that such objections have been answered by Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 729\n, 37 S. L. ed. 905, 918, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016, and Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 193, 199\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1121, 1125, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. In the former it was laid down that 'no formal complaint or pleadings are required.' The proposition is not affected by the later statutes. complaint or pleadings are required.' That is anything in the objection if we should consider it on its merits.\n As to the testimony that two of the appellants were merchants during the period of registration, all that appears is that the commissioner did not believe it. We cannot go outside the record of the specific case for the purpose of inquiring whether the decision was induced by some view of the law which may be open to argument. The same may be said as to the parol testimony as to the age of two of the appellants or their birth in this country. But we may add that it \n\n[193 U.S. 65, 78]\n\u00a0\n by no means follows from the decision in United States v. Gue Lim, \n176 U.S. 459\n, 44 L. ed. 544, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 415, that the minor children of laborers, old enough to do work, are not required to have certificates. The language of the statute certainly is broad enough to include them and does not indicate a division by local laws with regard to coming of age. The principle applicable to the admission into this country of the wife and children of a certificated merchant is not the principle applicable to such a case. As to the certificate of the United States commissioner, offered by Lew Guey, it was merely a written statement by the commissioner that a person of that name was brought before him on the usual charge, and was adjudged to have the right to remain in the United States by reason of being a citizen. Apart from the possibility that the commissioner in the present hearing was not satisfied of the identity of the party, such a statement is not the certificate of residence required by the act of 1892, and is not evidence of a judgment. United States v. Lee Poy Dew, 119 Fed. 786. The evidence that Yung Lee was disabled by sickness from obtaining a certificate did not satisfy the commissioner. We cannot say as matter of law that he was bound to be satisfied by the testimony of Yung Lee himself that he was so disabled.\n We have assumed, for the purpose of decision, what does not clearly appear from the record, that the judge who tried the case on appeal tried it solely on the commissioner's report of evidence and heard no witnesses. Whether the fact could be assumed if the result would be a reversal of the judgment below, we need not decide. See United States v. Lee Seick, 40 C. C. A. 448, 100 Fed. 398, 399. There is no other question worthy of notice. We are asked to express an opinion as to the right of the appellants to give bail pending their appeal, but that now is a moot point. We agree with the government that these cases are covered by previous decisions of this court.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

Sturdevant for defendant in error in No. 5.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are three writs of error to the supreme court of Wisconsin, brought to set aside convictions and sentences of the plaintiffs in error, the defendants below, upon informations filed by the district attorney. 113 Wis. 419, 89 N. W. 1135. The ground of the writs is that the proceedings violated the rights of the plaintiffs in error under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The informations were brought under the Wisconsin statutes of 1898,  4466a, which impose imprisonment or fine on 'any two or more persons who shall combine . . . for the purpose of wilfully or maliciously injuring another in his reputation, trade, business, or profession, by any means whatever,' etc. The plaintiffs in error were severally charged with unlawfully combining to- \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n gether with the intent of wilfully and maliciously injuring The Journal Company, a corporation, and certain persons named, stockholders and officers of the company, in their trade and business. It was alleged that the company was publisher of a newspaper in Milwaukee, and had notified an increase of about 25 per cent in its charges for advertising, and that thereupon the plaintiffs in error, who were managers of other newspapers in the same place, in pursuance of their combination, and with the intent of wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully injuring The Journal Company and the others named, agreed as follows: If any person should agree to pay the increased rate to The Journal Company, then he should not be permitted to advertise in any of the other three newspapers except at a corresponding increase of rate; but if he should refuse to pay the Journal Company the increased rate, then he should be allowed to advertise in any of the other three papers at the rate previously charged. It was alleged that this conspiracy was carried out, and that much damage to the business of The Journal Company ensued.\n The defendant Hoyt demurred to this information, setting up the 14th Amendment. Aikens and Huegin filed pleas which admitted the combination and intent of injuring The Journal Company, and the resulting damage, but alleged that the combination was entered into in trade competition, and that the parties had the right to make it under the 14th Amendment. The state demurred to the pleas. The demurrer of Hoyt was overruled; those of the state were sustained. The defendants were sentenced and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the supreme court of the state on the authority of an earlier decision between the same parties, reported in 110 Wis. 189, 62 L. R. A. 700, 85 N. W. 1046.\n The statute, it will be observed, punishes combining for the purpose of wilfully or maliciously injuring another in his business. If it should be construed literally, the word 'wilfully' would embrace all injuries intended to follow from the parties' acts, although they were intended only as the necessary means \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n to ulterior gain for the parties themselves. Taken in that way the word would hit making a new partnership, if it was intended thereby to hurt someone's else business by competition. We shall not consider whether that branch of the statute, so construed, could be sustained, and express no opinion about it. The supreme court of Wisconsin has intimated that a narrower interpretation will be adopted, and in the present case we have to deal only with the other branch, depending on the word 'maliciously,' as we shall explain in a moment. the last-quoted word we must take as intended to add something to the word 'wilfully,' and we can do so only by taking it in its true sense. We interpret 'maliciously injuring' to import doing a harm malevolently, for the sake of the harm as an end in itself, and not merely as a means to some further end legitimately desired. Otherwise the phrase would be tautologous, since a wilful injury is malicious in the sense familiar to declarations and indictments, where, indeed, the word means no more than foreseen, or even less than that. A death is caused of malice aforethought if, under the circumstances, known to the actor, the probability of its ensuing from the act done is great and manifest according to common experience. Com. v. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165, 178, 52 Am. Rep. 264; 1 East, P. C. 262. See also Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor, L. R. 23 Q. B. Div. 598, 613.\n The informations alleged a combination for the purpose of wilfully and maliciously injuring others, and therefore brought the case within the latter branch of the statute, if there are two, and if 'or' in the act is not taken to mean 'and.' It is true that the plan is set forth, and some argument was spent on whether that plan might or might not be an instrument of ultimate gain. But while that question may have been open when the state court was discussing the evidence warranting a commitment, in 110 Wis. 189, 62 L. R. A. 700, 85 N. W. 1046, none such is open here. The malevolent purpose is alleged, it is admitted by the demurrer, it is not sufficiently denied by the pleas, whatever we may conjecture would have been done if counsel had had this \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n decision before them. A purely malevolent act may be done even in trade competition.\n We come, then, to the question whether there is any constitutional objection to so much of the act as applies to this case. It has been thought by other courts as well as the supreme court of Wisconsin that such a combination, followed by damage, would be actionable even at common law. It has been considered that, prima facie, the intentional infliction of temporal damages is a cause of action, which, as a matter of substantive law, whatever may be the form of pleading, requires a justification if the defendant is to escape. Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor, L. R. 23 Q. B. Div. 598, 613, \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1892]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 25, 61 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 295, 66 L. T. N. S. 1, 40 Week. Rep. 337, 7 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 120, 56 J. P. 101. If this is the correct mode of approach, it is obvious that justifications may vary in extent, according to the principle of policy upon which they are founded, and that while some-for instance, at common law, those affecting the use of land-are absolute (Bradford v. Pickles \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1895]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 587), others may depend upon the end for which the act is done. Moran v. Dunphy, 177 Mass. 485, 487, 52 L. R. A. 115, 83 Am. St. Rep. 289, 59 N. E. 125; Plant v. Woods, 176 Mass. 492, 51 L. R. A. 339, 79 Am. St. Rep. 330, 57 N. E. 1011; Squires v. Wason Mfg. Co. 182 Mass. 137, 140, 141, 65 N. E. 32. See cases cited in 62 L. R. A. 673. It is no sufficient answer to this line of thought that motives are not actionable, and that the standards of the law are external. That is true in determining what a man is bound to foresee, but not necessarily in determining the extent to which he can justify harm which he has foreseen. Quinn v. Leathem \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1901]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 495, 524, 70 L. J. P. C. N. S. 76, 85 L. T. N. S. 289, 50 Week. Rep. 139, 65 J. P. 708.\n Whether, at common law combination would make conduct actionable which would be lawful in a single person, it is unnecessary to consider. Quinn v. Leathem \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1901]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 495, 70 L. J. P. C. N. S. 76, 85 L. T. N. S. 289, 50 Week. Rep. 139, 65 J. P. 708. We are aware, too, that a prevailing opinion in England makes motives immaterial, although it is probable that in Allen v. Flood \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1898]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 1, 94, 67 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 119, 77 L. T. N. S. 717, 46 Week. Rep. 258, 62 J. P. 595, the jury were instructed, as in Temperton v. Russell \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1893]\n\u00a0\n, 1 Q. B. 715, 719, 62 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 412, 4 Reports, 376, 69 L. T. N. S. 78, 41 Week. Rep. 565, 57 J. P. 676, in such a way that their finding of malice meant no more than that the defendant had acted with foresight of the harm which he would inflict, \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n as a means to an end. Quinn v. Leathem \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 1901]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 495, 514. However these things may be, we have said enough to show that there is no anomaly in a statute, at least which punishes a combination such as is charged here. It has been held that even the free use of land by a single owner for purely malevolent purposes may be restrained constitutionally, although the only immediate injury is to a neighboring landowner. Rideout v. Knox, 148 Mass. 368, 2 L. R. A. 81, 12 Am. St. Rep. 560, 19 N. E. 390. Whether this decision was right or not, when it comes to the freedom of the individual, malicious mischief is a familiar and proper subject for legislative repression. Com. v. Walden, 3 Cush. 558. Still more are combinations for the purpose of inflicting it. It would be impossible to hold that the liberty to combine to inflict such mischief, even upon such intangibles as business or reputation, was among the rights which the 14th Amendment was intended to preserve. The statute was assumed to be constitutional in Arthur v. Oakes, 25 L. R. A. 414, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 744, 11 C. C. A. 209, 24 U. S. App. 239, 63 Fed. 310, 325, 326.\n But if all these general considerations be admitted, it is urged, nevertheless, that the means intended to be used by this particular combination were simply the abstinence from making contracts; that a man's right so to abstain cannot be infringed on the ground of motives; and further, that it carries with it the right to communicate that intent to abstain to others, and to abstain in common with them. It is said that if the statute extends to such a case it must be unconstitutional. The fallacy of this argument lies in the assumption that the statute stands no better than if directed against the pure nonfeasance of singly omitting to contract. The statute is directed against a series of acts, and acts of several,-the acts of combining, with intent to do other acts. 'The very plot is an act in itself.' Mulcahy v. Queen, L. R. 3 H. L. 306, 317. But an act which, in itself, is merely a voluntary muscular contraction, derives all its character from the consequences which will follow it under the circumstances in which it was done. When the acts consist of making a combination calculated to cause temporal damage, the power to punish such \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 206]\n\u00a0\n acts, when done maliciously, cannot be denied because they are to be followed and worked out by conduct which might have been lawful if not preceded by the acts. No conduct has such an absolute privilege as to justify all possible schemes of which it may be a part. The most innocent and constitutionally protected of acts or omissions may be made a step in a criminal plot, and if it is a step in a plot, neither its innocence nor the Constitution is sufficient to prevent the punishment of the plot by law.\n It was urged farther that to make a right depend upon motives is to make it depend upon the whim of a jury, and to deny the right. But it must be assumed that the constitutional tribunal does its duty, and finds facts only because they are proved. The power of the legislature to make the fact of malice material we think sufficiently appears from what we already have said.\n Finally, it is argued that the supreme court of Wisconsin would hold that the statute extends to acts of which the motives were mixed, and which were done partly from disinterested malevolence and partly from a hope of gain. If so, it is said, the statute would be open to all the objections at which we have hinted in dealing with the word 'wilfully.' The supreme court did use some language which looked that way, but we consider it to have decided that the statute would be confined to combinations with intent to do wrongful harm. 110 Wis. 193, 260, 62 L. R. A. 700, 85 N. W. 1046. Thus limited, on whatever ground, the statute would punish only combinations of a kind for which no justification could be offered and those which were taken out of the justification by the motive with which they were made. We see no sufficient reason to believe that the court will go farther, or construe the act in such a way as to raise questions which we need not go into here. Therefore it is unnecessary to consider whether, on a more literal construction, the portion dealing with malicious intent could be separated from that which deals with the purpose of merely wilful injury, and saved, even if the latter were held to go too \n\n[195 U.S. 194, 207]\n\u00a0\n far. Probably the two phrases will be read together and the statute made unquestionable as a whole.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting:\n Not being able to concur in the conclusion of the court that the opinion of the supreme court of Wisconsin has affixed to the statute of that state a much narrower meaning than the text of the statute imports, and thinking, on the contrary, that not only such text, but the construction of the statute adopted by the supreme court of Wisconsin, operates to deprive the citizen of a lawful right to contract, protected by the 14th Amendment, I dissent. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMADO v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2014\n\n\n The act of April 12th, 1900, temporarily providing revenues and a civil government for Porto Rico, declares, among other things, that on and after its passage 'the same tariffs, customs, and duties shall be levied, collected, and paid upon all articles imported into Porto Rico from ports other than those of the United States which are required by law to be collected upon articles imported into the United States from foreign countries;' also, that 'the statutory laws of the United States not locally inapplicable, except as hereinbefore or hereinafter otherwise provided, shall have the same force and effect in Porto Rico as in the United States, except the internal revenue laws, which, in view of the provisions of section three, shall not have force and effect in Porto Rico.' 31 Stat. at L. 77, 80, chap. 191,  2, 14. \n\n[195 U.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n These statutes being in force, the plaintiff in error, Amado, was indicted in the district court of the United States for Porto Rico, upon the charge of having, on May 28th, 1901, unlawfully received, concealed, and facilitated the transportation, concealment, and sale of certain specified quantities of Holland gin, vermouth, brandy, and Danish beer, theretofore, as the accused well knew, fraudulently imported into Porto Rico, contrary to law, without the payment to the United States of the duties imposed upon such articles.\n The accused was duly arraigned, and found guilty by a jury. A motion in arrest of judgment having been overruled, he was sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary of Porto Rico for one year and one day, and to pay a fine of $500. A new trial was denied, and the accused sued out the present writ of error.\n In allowing the writ the judge of the district court expressed some doubt whether error would lie, but he resolved the doubt in favor of the defendant.\n The government insists that the writ of error should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court to review the judgment below; otherwise, that the judgment should be affirmed.\n It is provided by the above act of April 12th, 1900, that the district court of the United States for Porto Rico 'shall have, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.' 31 Stat. at L. 77, 84, chap. 191,  34.\n The act also provides that writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of the supreme court of Porto Rico and the district court of the United States shall be allowed and may be taken to this court 'in the same manner and under the same regulations and in the same cases as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States; and such writs of error and appeal shall be allowed in all cases where \n\n[195 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States, or treaty thereof, or an act of Congress, is brought in question and the right claimed thereunder is denied.' Id.  35.\n The review of the final judgment of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico is not restricted to those cases in which the Constitution, or a treaty of the United States, or an act of Congress is brought in question and the right claimed under it denied. This construction is too narrow and technical. There may be cases-certainly civil cases-in the United States district court for Porto Rico that do not involve any question arising under the Constitution, or a treaty, or an act of Congress; and yet if the case be one which, if determined in a supreme court of one of the territories of the United States, could be brought here for re-examination, the final judgment could be reviewed by this court, although no right of a distinctly Federal nature was involved. Royal Ins. Co. v. Martin, \n192 U.S. 149\n-60, 48 L. ed. 385-388, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247; Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 320\n, 48 S. L. ed. 994, 995, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 727. See Crowley v. United States, \n194 U.S. 461\n, 48 L. ed. 1075, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 731. But even this test, if applied here, will not avail the accused; for the statutes regulating the appellate jurisdiction of this court do not authorize a review of the final judgment in a supreme court of one of the territories of the United States in a criminal case like this one.\n Can our jurisdiction be sustained by reference to the words, in the Porto Rico act, 'in all cases where the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress, is brought in question and the right claimed thereunder is denied?' We must answer this question in the negative. The nearest approach to a claim of specific right under the Constitution or a treaty of the United States, or under an act of Congress, was when the accused, in his written motion to arrest the judgment or sentence, insisted that the indictment did not set forth 'an offense under the statutes of the United States.' But that language amounted to nothing more, in legal effect, than a plea of not guilty, or a demurrer upon the general ground that the indictment did not state enough to \n\n[195 U.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n show an offense. It was not an assertion of any particular right under the Constitution, or under any treaty, or under an act of Congress, which would be denied to him if the prosecution was sustained. His contention was only that he was not subject to criminal prosecution by reason of anything set forth in the indictment. The indictment was plainly sufficient under the statute prescribing the offense charged, and the objections to it were too indefinite to meet the requirements of the act of 1900, and make the case one which, by that act, could be brought to this court for review. Unless the case was one in which the judgment could be reviewed here, then such judgment would be final, and not subject to review; for no case determined in the United States court for Porto Rico can be carried to a circuit court of appeals. We said, in Royal Ins. Co. v. Martin, \n192 \nU.S. 149, 160\n, 48 S. L. ed. 385, 388, 24 Sup. Ct.

Quinton for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding in quo warranto, brought in the supreme court of the state of Kansas by the county attorney of Shawnee county of said state, to oust plaintiff in error from doing business in the state, and to declare void certain contracts entered into by the plaintiff in error with the State Text Book Commission.\n A preliminary injunction was granted restraining plaintiff in error from entering into any contract with any person of the state, and from furnishing school books to its agents in the state. \n\n[193 U.S. 49, 50]\n\u00a0\n Passing finally on the relief prayed for the supreme court, awarding judgment, said:\n'The plaintiff cannot, in this action, have an annulment of the contract already made. It may be that there are equitable circumstances forbidding the cancelation of such contract. It may be that compliance with the law by the defendant hereafter will retroactively validate the contract in the event that it should now be invalid. However, independently of such consideration, we do not have jurisdiction over that branch of the case. Our jurisdiction is in quo warranto alone. A grant of that jurisdiction does not authorize the joinder to a cause of action for ouster of another one for the annulment of a contract, merely because the subject-matter of the latter possesses incidental connection with the subject-matter of the former.\n\n'The defendant will be ousted of its claimed rights to do business in this state until it complies with the requirements of the law, but the prayer of the petition for the annulment of the contract will be denied.' [ 65 Kan. 847, 69 Pac. 563.]\n\n Plaintiff in error is a New Jersey corporation engaged in the publishing and selling of school books, and the charge of the defendant in error is that plaintiff in error was doing business in the state without having complied with the laws of the state in regard to foreign corporations.\n The laws of the state require a foreign corporation, as a condition of the right to do business in the state, to make an application to the charter board of the state to do such business and to file a certified copy of its charter or articles of incorporation, and to furnish certain information to such board. The statute also required the payment of a charter fee graduated upon the amount of the capital stock of the corporation. Laws 1896, chap. 10; Gen. Stat. 1901\n\n\n The court held that plaintiff in error had 'complied, although irregularly, informally, and out of time, with the law, except as to  2 of chapter 10 of the Laws of 1898,' and the requirements of that section were necessary to give plaintiff in error 'the status of a foreign corporation authorized to do business' in the state.\n The defense of plaintiff in error was, and its contention is \n\n[193 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n here, that its business was solely that of interstate commerce, and that the statute of Kansas alleged to have been violated could have no application to such business, and the court had no power to exclude plaintiff in error from transacting interstate commerce in the state. It was and is further contended that plaintiff in error had entered into contracts with certain persons and corporations in the state for the sale and delivery of its publications, which contracts were still in force and effect, and under which plaintiff in error had incurred liability; and if the statutes be construed as applicable to it they would impair the obligations of those contracts and be in violation of  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n A motion is made to dismiss on the ground that the judgment of the supreme court has been complied with. The compliance is not denied, but it is attempted to be justified on the ground that plaintiff in error had only to the 15th of September 'to supply the wants of the public schools in Kansas with the books it had contracted to deliver, and under the stress of this public necessity, and under the sanction and penalties of its contract, it felt coerced to make a payment aforesaid (the charter fee) and otherwise to comply with the statute as interpreted by the supreme court in the case at bar.'\n It also urged that another suit has been brought by the same law officer of the state in the name of the state, in the district court of Shawnee county, which suit is pending in the supreme court on appeal from the ruling of the district court denying a temporary injunction, and that it is contended by the state the judgment of the supreme court in the case at bar was an adjudication of a noncompliance of plaintiff in error with the statutes of the state. And it is alleged that the same defenses were made as in the case at bar. It is hence contended that 'there still exists a controversy, undetermined and unsettled,' involving the right of the state to enforce the statute against a corporation engaged in interstate commerce.\n The motion to dismiss must be granted. We said in Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132: \n\n[193 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n 'The duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it. It necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal. And such a fact, when not appearing on the record, may be proved by extrinsic evidence.'\n The principle was discussed at some length and many illustrations of its enforcement were given. It has had illustrations since. New Orleans Flour Inspectors v. Glover, \n160 U.S. 170\n, 40 L. ed. 382, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321; Codlin v. Kohlhausen, \n181 U.S. 151\n, 45 L. ed. 793, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584.\n The case at bar is certainly within the principle. The judgment has been complied with. It makes no difference that plaintiff in error 'felt coerced' into compliance. A judgment usually has a coercive effect, and necessarily presents to the party against whom it is rendered the consideration whether it is better to comply or continue the litigation. After compliance there is nothing to litigate.\n It is further urged that another suit has been brought, and, as decisive of its issues or some of its issues, the judgment in the case at bar is pleaded. But that suit is not before us. We have not now jurisdiction of it or its issues. Our power only extends over, and is limited by, the conditions of the case now before us.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN STEEL & WIRE CO. v. SPEED(1904)\nNo. 356\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 500, 501]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Josiah Patterson and Messrs. Paterson, Neely, & Henderson, and Pam, Calhoun, & Glennon for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 500, 505]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles T. Cates, Jr., W. H. Carroll, and James M. Greer for defendant in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Whether the plaintiff in error is entitled to recover the sum of certain taxes which were paid under protest, on the ground that the taxes were repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, is the question for decision on this record.\n Section 28, article 2, of the Constitution of the state of Tennessee, so far as pertinent to the issue to be decided, is as follows:\n'All property, real, personal, or mixed, shall be taxed. . . . All property shall be taxed according to its value, that value to be ascertained in such manner as the legislature shall direct, so that taxes shall be equal and uniform throughout the state. No one species of property from which a tax may be collected shall be taxed higher than any other species of property at the same value. But the legislature shall have power to tax merchants, peddlers, and privileges, in such manner as they may from time to time direct. The portion of a merchant's capital used in the purchase of merchandise sold by him to nonresidents and sent beyond the state shall not be taxed at a higher rate than the ad valorem tax on property.'\n\n Section 30, article 2, of the same Constitution, provides:\n'No article manufactured of the produce of this state shall be taxed otherwise than to pay inspection fees.'\n\n The assessing and taxing laws of the state of Tennessee in force at the time the taxes in controversy were levied provided, first, for a general ad valorem tax upon all property; second, for \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n a merchants' tax separate from the general ad valorem levy, this latter tax being of two classes: A tax upon the average capital invested in business, and a privilege tax, which was at a different rate, and in other respects distinct from the merchants' tax just referred to. Moreover, at the time the tax assessments in question were made the statutes of the state of Tennessee concerning the merchants' tax contained the following:\n'The term 'merchants,' as used in this act, includes all persons, co- partnerships, or corporations engaged in trade or dealing in any kind of goods, wares, merchandise, either on land or in steamboats, wharf boats, or other craft stationed or plying in the waters of this state, and confectioners, whether such goods, wares, or merchandise be kept on hand for sale or the same be purchased and delivered for profit as ordered.'\n\n Moreover, the assessment laws, whilst providing that all 'persons, copartners, and joint stock companies engaged in the manufacture of any goods, wares, merchandise, or other articles of value shall pay an ad valorem tax upon the actual cash value of their property, real, personal, or mixed, . . .' made the following exception: 'Provided, the value of articles manufactured from the produce of the state in the hands of the manufacturer shall be deducted in assessing the property.' And a like exception qualified a provision imposing an ad valorem tax upon the capital and franchises of manufacturing corporations. Besides, the assessing statutes contained a general provision exempting 'all growing crops of whatever nature or kind-the direct product of the soil of this state-in the hands of the producer or his immediate vendee, and manufactured articles from the produce of this state in the hands of the manufacturer.'\n Whilst these laws were in force the officer whose duty it was to list the merchant tax assessed against the American Steel & Wire Company, which we shall hereafter call the steel company, both the general merchants' tax and a merchants' privilege tax. The company resisted the assessment, and, \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n after unsuccessfully pressing, through the administrative channels provided by the law of Tennessee, its objections, paid the tax under protest, and thereupon, as authorized by the law of Tennessee, commenced this suit to recover the amount paid.\n Without going into detail, it suffices to say that the bill filed in the action to recover substantially alleged as follows: That the company was a New Jersey corporation, having a place of business in the city of Chicago, and owning and operating the various plants for the manufacture of wire, nails, etc., in states other than the state of Tennessee. And, for the purpose of facilitating the sale and delivery of the goods by it manufactured, it had selected Memphis, Tennessee, as a distributing point, and had made an arrangement in that city with the Patterson Transfer Company, a corporation engaged at Memphis in the transfer of merchandise. By this arrangement the Patterson Transfer Company was to take charge of the products when shipped to Memphis, consigned to the steel company, store them in a warehouse there, assort them and make delivery to the persons to whom the goods were sold by the steel company. It was averred that the Patterson Transfer Company, in fulfilling its obligations under the contract, was in no sense a merchant, but only a carrier, and that the steel company, in storing and delivering its goods at Memphis, was not a merchant in Memphis, but was simply a manufacturer, delivering in the original packages goods made in other states to the persons who had bought them. In substance, besides, it was alleged that the goods in the warehouse in Memphis were merely in transit from the point of manufacture outside of the state of Tennessee to the persons to whom they had been previously sold. The levy of the tax was charged to be repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States: First, because the goods in the warehouse in Memphis were in the original packages as shipped from other states and had not been sold in Tennessee, and hence had not been commingled with the property of that state, and because, in any event, they had acquired no situs in Tennessee, as they \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n were moving in the channels of interstate commerce from the place where the goods were manufactured, for delivery to the persons to whom in effect they had been sold. Second. Because, as the state of Tennessee exempted from taxation articles manufactured from the produce of that state, no tax could be imposed by Tennessee upon articles manufactured from the produce of other states, without operating a discrimination against articles manufactured from the produce of other states. Issue was joined on the complaint. The trial court, deducing from the proof conclusions of ultimate fact in favor of the complainant, entered a decree in favor of the steel company. The case was taken to the supreme court of the state. In that court the validity of the tax was upheld and the judgment below was reversed. The questions raised concerning the repugnancy of the tax to the Constitution of the United States were expressly considered and decided adversely to the steel company. This writ of error was thereupon prosecuted.\n The supreme court of Tennessee stated the facts as follows:\n'Complainant is a corporation created under the laws of New Jersey. Its situs is in the state of New Jersey, and its principal business office is situated at Chicago, Ill. It is engaged in the manufacture of nails, staples, barbed and smooth wire, at different points north of the Ohio river. None of its manufactories are situated in Tennessee, and all of its products consigned to Memphis are shipped from points beyond the limits of this state.\n\n'Prior to the 1st of February, 1900, its manufactured products were sold and distributed throughout the southwest from Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Greenville, Vicksburg, and Natchez, Mississippi; and New Orleans, Louisiana. About that time the Patterson Transfer Company, a corporation created under the laws of Tennessee, having its situs at Memphis, and doing business at Memphis, represented to appellee that Memphis was the most available point in the southwest at which to mass and distribute its manufactured products to its customers in that section. At this time, and for many years prior thereto, \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 512]\n\u00a0\n the Patterson Transfer Company had been engaged in the business of transferring passengers and freights to and from the various depots at Memphis, and from the landings on the Mississippi river. Appellee entered into an arrangement with the Patterson Transfer Company, whereby said company was to receive its manufactured products at Memphis, assort them so as to separate the different kinds of nails, staples, and wire, and then to deliver them, either to the jobbers at Memphis, or to the jobbers beyond the limits of Tennessee, over the various lines of railroads and steamboats running into Memphis, as directed by complainant.\n\n'None of complainant's products are ever sold to the Patterson Transfer Company, or are by it sold to others, and neither its officers nor employees have any knowledge whatever of the price at which goods are sold by complainant. Under the arrangement between them, the business of the Patterson Transfer Company, in connection with complainant's products, is confined to their transfer to the warehouses, their assortment in the warehouses, the keeping of them in storage, and their subsequent delivery to the customers of the complainant, under its general or special orders, as below indicated.\n\n'The goods of complainant are manufactured at different points, and it is convenient and useful, from a business point of view, to mass them at some place at which they can be assorted, and from which they can be distributed to complainant's customers. It is impracticable to assort the goods either at the river landing or at the railroad depots when they reach Memphis, and, in order to facilitate the work, the Patterson Transfer Company has rented three warehouses in which the goods are stored for the purpose of assortment and distribution, and for other purposes below indicated. These warehouses are rented exclusively for this purpose, and the manufactured products of complainant, and no other goods, are stored therein.\n\n'The evidence further shows that, as a general rule, prior to the time the goods are shipped to Memphis, sales agents of the complainant canvass the southwestern country, and make \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 513]\n\u00a0\n contracts exclusively with jobbers; and in each instance where a contract is made it is embodied in writing, on a form prepared by complainant, in which is set down the amount of goods which constitutes the subject of the contract, and the time agreed upon within which they are to be delivered. The goods so contracted for are described as so many kegs of nails, so many kegs of staples, so many reels of barbed wire, or so many coils of smooth wire, according to the terms of the contract, in respect of the quantity agreed upon. But the contract does not specify the grade and quality of the goods desired. The grade and quality are left open, to be subsequently specified when the customer desires a delivery, as below stated. The customer can, when he makes his specification, select any grade of goods, he desires, and, upon so selecting, they will be delivered to him, up to the quantity contracted for, within the time agreed upon, at prices contracted for applicable to the several grades. In fixing the price of its goods, the complainant always, except when necessary to lower prices in order to meet competition, figures in the freight on the goods.\n\n'As above indicated, it is shown in the evidence that there are many different kinds of nails, as well as different kinds of barbed and smooth wire, and it is expressly stipulated in the contract that the customer shall have the privilege of specifying, during the life of the contract, the kind of wire, or kind of nails or staples he desires delivered to him under the contract. These contracts also specify from sixty to ninety days as the time within which the products are to be delivered; and at any time during the period prescribed in the contract the customer may designate the kind of goods he desires delivered under it.\n\n'These contracts are made usually before the goods arrive at Memphis, their point of destination, and generally the contracts are made in advance of the production of the goods at the complainant's factory. Usually the sales agents of the complainant, not only in advance of the shipment of the goods, but in advance of their production, canvass the southwestern country in the manner above stated, visiting the various \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 514]\n\u00a0\n jobbers, ascertaining the amount of goods they will require within sixty or ninety days, and the contract is prepared to the purport above indicated, in which the complainant obligates itself to deliver, at the prices stated, as above mentioned, the amount of goods contracted for therein, and the customer agrees to receive and pay for that quantity, upon the goods being delivered to him after he shall have made, and according to, his specification, which he may make during the life of the contract; the customer reserving the right, in the face of the contract, to specify the exact grade or quality of goods he desires delivered under it. He does this after the making of the contract, and at any time he desires to do so, within the life of the contract, by writing out his specification showing precisely what grade of goods he desires, and forwards this specification to the office of complainant in Chicago, and then the goods, under an order from the Chicago office, addressed to the Patterson Transfer Company at Memphis, are selected by the latter out of the mass of goods belonging to the complainant in the aforesaid warehouses in Memphis, and are shipped by the said Patterson Transfer Company to the customer who has signed the specification. This order from the complainant to the Patterson Transfer Company is effected through the agency of a copy of the specification, which is forwarded to the latter from the complainant's central office at Chicago, it being understood, according to the course of business between the two companies, that the Patterson Transfer Company will select out of the mass of goods those set out in the specification, and will ship them to the customer whose name is signed to the specification, upon receiving such copy of the specification from the central office at Chicago.\n\n'This method of transacting the business is modified in practice, in so far as the fulfilment of the contracts made with the jobbers at Memphis is concerned. For the convenience of the Memphis trade, complainant advises the Patterson Transfer Company of the names of its customers at Memphis, and that company is instructed to deliver the goods embraced in the \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 515]\n\u00a0\n contracts with the Memphis jobbers, in the following manner: The Memphis jobber makes out his specification in duplicate, and addresses a letter to complainant, as in any other case; but, instead of forwarding this letter and his specification directly to complainant, he delivers the letter to the Patterson Transfer Company, and the Patterson Transfer Company at once delivers the goods so specified, attaching the dray receipt to a copy of the specification, and forwards the specification, letter, and dray receipt to the office of complainant in Chicago, and that office makes out an invoice and sends it directly to the jobber. Another variation is made in the course of the business, in favor of the Memphis jobbers, to the following effect: Any jobber in Memphis who is a recognized customer of the complainant can, without any previous written contract, or other special agreement, make out a specification of the goods he desires, and hand this, in duplicate form, to the Patterson Transfer Company. Upon this being done it is the duty of the Patterson Transfer Company, under its general instructions from the complainant, to select out of the mass of goods in the warehouses, goods corresponding to those contained in the specification, and deliver them to such jobber, this delivery being usually made by the next day, or, at most, within two or three days. Other deliveries on specifications sent direct to the Chicago office are not usually made within less than six or eight days, and sometimes a longer period is required. When the Patterson Transfer Company receives from Memphis jobbers the specifications, which are the special subject of this paragraph, one copy is kept by it, and the other copy is forwarded to the office at Chicago, where, upon its arrival and reception, the customer is charged with the goods specified, at current prices.\n\n'The testimony shows that of the mass of goods kept on hand in Memphis, in the above-mentioned warehouses, about 90 per cent ultimately goes to jobbers who reside outside of Memphis, and beyond the limits of this state. The remaining 10 per cent goes to the Memphis jobbers in fulfilment of the \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 516]\n\u00a0\n general contracts previously referred to, pursuant to specifications thereunder made, and under specifications made without previous written contracts, the latter covering about 2 1\/2 per cent of all the goods kept on hand.\n\n'No one but an agreed or recognized customer of the complainant can make out a specification, or have goods delivered from the storehouses of the Patterson Transfer Company; and no goods are ever delivered or distributed to anyone by the Patterson Transfer Company except under the express directions of complainant, or under general directions given by complainant to the said Patterson Transfer Company, in favor of recognized and approved customers of the complainant, whose names are furnished by it to the Patterson Transfer Company.\n\n'The testimony further shows that the quantity of goods which the complainant keeps on hand at Memphis fluctuates considerably, owing to the state of trade from time to time. Sometimes the stock is as low in value as $30,000, and sometimes the complainant has on hand a stock of the value of more than $100,000.\n\n'Some of the goods-a very small amount-are shipped to Memphis by rail. Nearly all of these goods which come to the hands of the Patterson Transfer Company from this complainant are transported to Memphis on barges belonging to transportation companies, in which complainant has no interest, and which are engaged in the carrying trade. As a general rule, while the complainant endeavors to secure contracts covering its output before the goods are manufactured, yet it does not always do so; but, taking advantage of the seasons when there is a goods stage of water in the rivers, which must be used in floating its products from its mills to Memphis, it masses its goods at the latter point in anticipation of future sales.\n\n'The testimony shows that when goods are shipped from complainant's mills, consigned to Memphis, the Patterson Transfer Company is notified by the Chicago office that a certain quantity of complainant's products were shipped at \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 517]\n\u00a0\n a certain time, on barges, to the port of Memphis. These barges are met at the river landing by the Patterson Transfer Company, which receives the goods, transfers them to its warehouses and assorts them. Then, from time to time, it ships the goods on specifications, as before explained. On receiving the goods they are credited to the complainant on the books of the Patterson Transfer Company, and, on being shipped out, they are charged on the same books to the complainant. When the goods reach Memphis they are always consigned to the complainant, in care of the Patterson Transfer Company.\n\n'All the goods forwarded to Memphis are products of the factories of complainant. No part of them are ever purchased by it. Its sales agents are exclusively engaged in selling these products. They are produced by complainant beyond the limits of this state, and are made the subject of contracts by its sales agents throughout the southwest, in the manner before explained. These sales agents report all contracts effected by them directly to the office in Chicago, whether made with the jobbers at Memphis, or elsewhere beyond the limits of this state. All invoices for goods, when sold by specifications in the manner above stated, are made out at the office at Chicago, and forwarded directly to the customer, in the manner and under the circumstances previously stated.\n\n'Some of the complainant's goods are produced at one factory and some at another, and, consequently, when a purchaser contracts for the delivery to him, within sixty to ninety days, of a certain number of packages, it frequently turns out that some of the goods desired are the product of one factory, and some of another, and it is, accordingly, most convenient in the conduct of complainant's business that goods from complainant's various factories should be massed at some point where they can be dealt with in the manner before explained.\n\n'Complainant's goods are put up in the following original packages: The nails and staples are put up in kegs, each keg weighing 100 pounds; the smooth wire in coils tied by wires, \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 518]\n\u00a0\n and each coil weighing 100 pounds; the barbed wire on reels, the wire on each reel weighing 100 pounds. Each package is separately and distinctly made up at the factories for convenience of transportation, and is, in this form, delivered to the common carriers. In this from they are delivered at the initial point of transportation. In this form they are transported in barges, or by railroads, to Memphis, and received by the Patterson Transfer Company. In this form they are assorted at the warehouses by the Patterson Transfer Company, and delivered by it to the complainant's customers at Memphis, under the circumstances previously stated, or to the various lines of steamboats and railroads running out of Memphis, consigned, under circumstances previously stated, to customers beyond the limits of Tennessee, and in this form they ultimately come to the hands of complainant's customers in such foreign state. Each package is separate and distinct in itself, and while no particular package is consigned to any special customer, each keg of nails and staples is marked so as to show exactly what the package contains, and each coil and reel of wire is marked with a tag showing what the coil or reel contains, and no package is ever changed in any particular from the time it leaves the factory until it ultimately reaches the hands of the customer.\n\n'The testimony shows that Memphis has, within recent years, become, by reason of its accessibility to railway and river transportation, a great distributing point; and it was selected as the basis of the operations which are the subject of the present controversy, by reason of these exceptional advantages.\n\n'Other facts proven by the complainant are as follows: The testimony of Mr. Young, the tax assessor, shows that none of the cotton shipped into Memphis from the surrounding states pays any tax whatever, and that the manufacturers of lumber in Memphis pay no tax on lumber made from logs which are produced from the soil of this state.' [75 S. W. 1037.]\n\n With these facts in hand we are of opinion that the court \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 519]\n\u00a0\n below was right in deciding that the goods were not in transit, but, on the contrary, had reached their destination at Memphis, and were there held in store at the risk of the steel company, to be sold and delivered as contracts for that purpose were completely consummated. All question, therefore, as to the power of the state to levy the merchants' tax based on the contrary contention, being without merit, may be put out of view. The other propositions pressed upon our attention require consideration. They relate to two subjects: First, the asserted want of power of the state of Tennessee to tax because the goods were imported from another state, and were yet, it is contended, in the original packages; and, second, because of the alleged discrimination asserted to result from the provision of the state Constitution exempting goods manufactured from the produce of the state.\n\n 1. \nSince Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 436, 6 L. ed. 684, it has not been open to question that taxation imposed by the states upon imported goods, whether levied directly on the goods imported or indirectly by burdening the right to dispose of them, is repugnant to that provision of the Constitution providing that 'No state shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports.' (Article 1 ,  10, paragraph 3.) And Brown v. Maryland also settled that where goods were imported they preserved their character, as imports, and were therefore not subject to either direct or indirect state taxation as long as they were unsold in the original packages in which they were imported. A recent case referring to the authorities and restating this elementary doctrine is May v. New Orleans, \n178 U.S. 496\n, 44 L. ed. 1165, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 976. Assuming that the goods concerning which the state taxes in this case were levied were in the original packages and had not been sold, if the bringing of the goods into Tennessee from another state constituted an importation, in the constitutional signification of that word, it is clear they could not be directly or indirectly taxed. But the goods not having been brought from abroad, they were not imported in the legal sense, and \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 520]\n\u00a0\n were subject to state taxation after they had reached their destination and whilst held in the state for sale. This is as conclusively foreclosed by the decisions of this court as is the doctrine resting upon the decision in Brown v. Maryland. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 19 L. ed. 382; Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 29 L. ed. 257, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1091. The doctrine upon which the cases rest was this,-that imports, in the constitutional sense, embrace only goods brought from a foreign country, and consequently do not include merchandise shipped from one state to another. The several states, therefore, not being controlled as to such merchandise by the prohibition against the taxation of imports, it was held that the states had the power, after the goods had reached their destination and were held for sale, to tax them, without discrimination, like other property situated within the state.\n Those two cases decided, the one more than thirty-five and the other more than eighteen years ago, are decisive of every contention urged on this record depending on the import and the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. The doctrine which the two cases announced has never since been questioned. It has become the basis of taxing power exerted for years, by all the states of the Union. The cases themselves have been approvingly referred to in decisions in this court too numerous to be cited, and we therefore content ourselves by mentioning two of the cases where the doctrine was restated. Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 39 L. ed. 430, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367; Kelley v. Rhoads, \n188 U.S. 1\n, 47 L. ed. 359, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259. But it is strenuously insisted that the principle of the cases referred to, reiterated again and again and uniformly followed for so long a period of time, has been, by inevitable implication, overruled by the cases of Leisy v.

Rep. 725, and other cases resting on the rule expounded in those cases.\n We might well leave the unsoundness of the proposition to be demonstrated by what we have previously said, and also by the fact that, in Leisy v. Hardin and Lyng v. Michigan, and most of the similar cases relied on, the decisions in Woodruff \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 521]\n\u00a0\n v. Parham and Brown v. Houston were referred to without even an intimation that those cases were deemed to be overruled or even qualified. The earnestness with which the contention is pressed induces us, however, brieftached. to point out the misconception upon which it rests. It results from assuming that the rule which governs in a case where there is an absolute prohibition is applicable where no such prohibition obtains. Brown v. Maryland illustrates the first of these cases, while Woodruff v. Parham, Brown v. Houston, Leisy v. Hardin, Lyng v. Michigan are examples of the other. Thus, in Brown v. Maryland there was an absolute want of power to tax imports, and it was held that a state enactment which operated to tax imports, whether directly or indirectly, was within the positive prohibition. In other words, that imports could not be taxed at all until they had completely lost their character as such. Woodruff v. Parham and Brown v. Houston, on the other hand, so far as interstate commerce was concerned, dealt with no positive and absolute inhibition against the exercise of the taxing power, but determined whether a particular exertion of that power by a state so operated upon interstate commerce as to amount to a regulation thereof, in conflict with the paramount authority conferred upon Congress. In order to fix the period when interstate commerce terminated, the criterion announced in Brown v. Maryland-that is, sale in the original packages at the point of destination-was applied. The court, therefore, conceded that the goods which were taxed had not completely lost their character as interstate commerce, since they had not been sold in the original packages. As, however, they had arrived at their destination, were at rest in the state, were enjoying the protection which the laws of the state afforded, and were taxed without discrimination, like all other property, it was held that the tax did not amount to a regulation in the sense of the Constitution, although its levy might remotely and indirectly affect interstate commerce. In Leisy v. Hardin and Lyng v. Michigan the same question in a different aspect was presented. The goods had reached their \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 522]\n\u00a0\n destination and the question was not the power of the state to tax them, but its authority to treat the goods as not the subjects of interstate commerce, and to prohibit their introduction or sale. This was held to be a regulation within the constitutional sense, and therefore void. The cases, therefore, did not decide that interstate commerce was to be considered as having completely terminated at one time for the purposes of import taxation, and at a different period for the purposes of interstate commerce. But both cases, whilst conceding that interstate commerce was completely terminated only after the sale at the point of destination in the original packages, were rested upon the nature and operation of the particular exertion of state authority considered in the respective cases.\n\n 2. \nThe discrimination is asserted to have arisen from the provision of the state Constitution, saying that 'no article manufactured of the produce of this state shall be taxed otherwise than to pay inspection fees.' But in Kurth v. State (1887) 86 Tenn. 134, 5 S. W. 593, it was decided that this provision of the Constitution referred only to a direct levy of taxation on articles manufactured of the produce of the state, and did not apply to taxes levied by virtue of the grant conferred by the Constitution to tax 'merchants, peddlers, and privileges, in such manner as they (the legislature) may from time to time direct.' The two provisions, it was held, should be construed together, so that the one would not limit the other. We have been referred to no case decided by the supreme court of Tennessee modifying this interpretation of the state Constitution, and its correctness is in effect directly affirmed by the ruling made by the court in this case. Now the tax complained of on this record is not the general ad valorem tax levied on property as such, but is a merchants' tax, and is therefore not within the purview of the exemption clause from which it is asserted the discrimination arises. Construing the taxing statutes of the state, the court below decided in this case that they equally apply to all merchants, and hence did not discriminate as against any member of the merchants' class. The argument \n\n[192 U.S. 500, 523]\n\u00a0\n is made that under the facts found by the court below it was erroneously held that the steel company, because of the business which it carried on in the state of Tennessee, was a merchant within the statutes, and the power to review this question, it is insisted, should be exerted because the question is Federal in its nature. The contention is without merit. As the levy of the merchants' tax violated no Federal right, the mere determination of who were merchants within the state law involved no Federal question. The construction of the state law being conclusive and embracing all persons doing a like business with the steel company, it follows that there was no discrimination. Conceding it to be true, as argued, that in the past there would seem to have been conflict of opinion in the court of Tennessee in interpreting various statutes concerning the merchants' tax, this contrariety does not concern the meaning of the statute construed in this case. As that statute has been construed by the state court as applying to all merchants and as embracing alike all persons engaged in the character of business which the steel company was carrying on, it follows that there is no ground upon which to predicate the complaint of undue discrimination. Nor do we think that the opinion of the supreme court of Tennessee in Benedict v. Davidson County (not yet efficially reported), 67 S. W. 806, conflicts with the views just expressed. That case involved, not a merchants' tax, but the validity of a general ad valorem levy on property as such, and, therefore, affords no ground for the contention that manufacturers in Tennessee who shipped the goods by them made from the products of the state to a depot for sale, and there sold them under conditions and circumstances identical with those presented here, could not be taxed as merchants under the law of Tennessee.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBACHE v. HUNT(1904)\nNo. 177\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. F. Spiegelberg for appellant.\n Messrs. Adrian H. Joline and Clarence Brown for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was brought directly to this court as coming within the first of the classes of cases enumerated in  5 of \n\n[193 U.S. 523, 524]\n\u00a0\n the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], in which that may be done, the circuit court having certified that the jurisdiction of the court was in issue, and granted the appeal on the ground.\n The case was briefly this: Samuel Hunt, receiver, filed his petition in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Ohio in the foreclosure suit of The Continental Trust Company of New York v. The Toledo, St. Louis, & Kansas City Railroad Company, Jules S. Bache, Sylvester H. Kneeland, and others, asserting that he was entitled, out of certain of the first mortgage bonds foreclosed in the suit, and stock of the railroad company, in the hands of the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, to be reimbursed for amounts paid by him, or his predecessors, as receiver, in the extinguishment of prior claims which the bonds and stock had been deposited to secure, and seeking a decree that they be delivered to him, or sold and the proceeds so delivered, etc. The deposit had been made to secure payment of certain underlying liens, which Kneeland had agreed to pay and discharge, and which he had failed to do, and the receiver had done so out of the moneys and property of the railroad company.\n Bache, who was a citizen of, and resided in, New York, and others, were ordered to demur, plead, or answer the petition, and copies of the order were mailed to the parties named, including Bache. Bache appeared specially and filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter because of the pendency in the supreme court of New York of a suit instituted prior to the filing of Hunt's petition by Bache as a judgment creditor of Kneeland against the Toledo, St. Louis, & Kansas City Railroad Company, Kneeland, and the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, in which the last-mentioned company had been appointed receiver of the securities forming the subject of the Hunt petition, on the same day on which the Hunt petition was filed; and of his person because of the insufficiency of the method of service of the order. The plea was overruled.\n The circuit court held that when the receiver used the \n\n[193 U.S. 523, 525]\n\u00a0\n moneys of the receivership to discharge the underlying liens, the equitable right accrued to him and to those whom he represented, to be reimbursed out of the securities deposited with the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company; and that, as a junior encumbrancer, Bache had never been dismissed from the suit, and as such was before the court for all purposes of the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property. It appeared that Bache was made one of the original defendants in the foreclosure suit as a junior encumbrancer and entered his appearance; that he afterwards set up his claim, by answer, in that suit, it being the same claim on which his proceeding in the state court was founded; that he filed his claims before the special master under order in that behalf; and that Kneeland was also a party to the cause.\n Bache, declining to plead further, the petition was taken as confessed as to him, and a decree was subsequently entered that the Toledo, St. Louis & Western Railroad Company, as successor to the rights of Hunt, as receiver, and his predecessors, was entitled out of the securities in the hands of the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company to be reimbursed in the amounts which had been paid by the receivers in respect of the prior claims; and that said securities be delivered to the railroad company, or, on default of such delivery within thirty days, that they should stand canceled and of no further force or effect. From this decree the pending appeal was thereupon taken.\n It will be perceived that the jurisdiction of the circuit court was only questioned in respect of its general authority as a judicial tribunal, and not in respect of its power as a court of the United States. The established rules of practice as to bringing in parties to ancillary or pro interesse suo proceedings, and those governing courts of concurrent jurisdiction as between themselves, were alone involved. It is settled that the question of jurisdiction, which the act of March 3, 1891, provides may be certified to this court directly, must be one involving the jurisdiction of the circuit court as a Federal \n\n[193 U.S. 523, 526]\n\u00a0\n court. Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 U.S. 225\n, ante, p. 119, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 119; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n173 U.S. 501\n, 43 L. ed. 783, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 497.\n Tested by this rule our jurisdiction fails, and the appeal must be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE SHIPBUILDING & DRY DOCK CO. v. CITY OF BALTIMORE(1904)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. P. Keech, Jr., Leon E. Greenbaum, and Archibald H. Taylor for plaintiff in error.[ Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. City of Baltimore \n195 U.S. 375\n (1904) ]\n\n\n[195 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edgar Allan Poe and W. Cabell Bruce for defendants in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the court of appeals of the state of Maryland, brought to reverse a judgment sustaining a tax upon certain land. The plaintiff in error filed a petition and appeal from an assessment by the appeal tax court of Baltimore in the Baltimore city court, alleging that its land was not subject to taxation, and, if subject, was taxed too high. The city court reduced the tax, but held the land liable, and its judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals. 97 Md. 97, 54 Atl. 623. The land in question formerly belonged to the United States, being part of the property known as Fort McHenry, and is admitted not to have been taxable at that time. Under an act of Congress of June 19, 1878 (20 Stat. at L. 167, chap. 310), it was conveyed to the plaintiff in error on March 26, 1879. By the terms of the deed, following the requirements of the act, the consideration of the conveyance and the condition upon which it was made was that the dock company should construct a dry dock upon the land as specified, which it did, and that it should 'accord to the United States the right to the use forever of the said dry dock at any time for the prompt examination and repair of vessels belonging to the United States, free from charge for docking, and if at any time said property hereby conveyed shall be diverted to any other use \n\n[195 U.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n than that herein named, or if the said dry dock shall be at any time unfit for use for a period of six months or more, the property hereby conveyed, with all its privileges and appurtenances, shall revert to, and become the absolute property of, the United States.' This condition is relied upon as still keeping the land outside the taxing power of the state.\n It is argued that the United States has such an interest in the land as to prevent the tax, and also that the land is an agency of the government by the terms of the grant. It is noted that this tax originally was levied upon the land, not upon the dock company's interest, and although the language of the final judgment was 'the property concerned in the appeal in this case,' that is supposed to mean the same thing.\n We will deal with the argument drawn from the last consideration first. It is true that commonly taxes on land create a lien paramount to all interest, and that a tax sale often has been said to extinguish all titles, and to start a new one. Hefner v. Northwestern Mut. L. Ins. Co. \n123 \nU.S. 747, 751\n, 31 S. L. ed. 309, 311, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337; Textor v. Shipley, 86 Md. 424, 438, 38 Atl. 932; Emery v. Boston Terminal Co. 178 Mass. 172, 184, 86 Am. St. Rep. 473, 59 N. E. 763. Perhaps it was assumed that this always was the effect of tax sales, in Northern P. R. Co. v. Traill County, \n115 U.S. 600\n, 29 L. ed. 477, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 201. But it needs no argument to show that a state may do less. It may tax a life estate to one and a remainder to another, and sell only the interest of the party making default. With regard to what the state of Maryland has done and what are the purport and attempted effect of the tax in this case, we follow the court of appeals. That court treated the tax and the lien as going only to the dock company's interest in the land, although, probably by an oversight, it neglected to modify the judgment according to its own suggestion so as to show the fact. That only the company's interest was taxed is shown by the reduction of the assessment on account of the condition. Of course it does not matter what form of words the judgment employs when its meaning is thus declared by the court having the matter under its control. \n\n[195 U.S. 375, 382]\n\u00a0\n In the next place, as to the interest of the United States in the land. This is a mere condition subsequent. There is no easement or present right in rem. The obligation to keep up the dock and to allow the United States to use it carries active duties, and is purely personal. The property is subject to forfeiture, it is true, if the obligation is not fulfilled. But it is only by forfeiture that the rights of the United States can be enforced against the res. It would be a very harsh doctrine that would deny the right of the states to tax lands because of a mere possibility that they might lapse to the United States. The contrary is the law. The condition cannot be extinguished by the state, but the fee is in the dock company, and that can be taxed and, if necessary, sold, subject to the condition. See Northern P. R. Co. v. Myers, \n172 \nU.S. 589, 598\n, 43 S. L. ed. 564, 567, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276; Maish v. Arizona, \n164 U.S. 599\n, 607-609, 41 L. ed. 567, 570, 571, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 193; Central P. R. Co. v. Nevada, \n162 \nU.S. 512, 525\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1057, 1061, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 885. The title of the dock company was not inalienable, as that of the railroad was held to be in Northern P. R. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 47 L. ed. 1044, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617.\n Finally, we are of opinion that the land is not exempt as an agency of the United States. The dock company disclaimed that position for itself as a corporation, but asserts it for the land. The position is answered technically, perhaps, by what we have said already. The United States has no present right to the land, but merely a personal claim against the corporation, reinforced by a condition. But, furthermore, it seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.

The averments gave jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship. A demurrer to the original complaint was sustained for reasons stated by Lochren, J. (113 Fed. 417.) Thereupon 'an amended and substituted complaint' was filed, and on demurrer judgment was rendered in favor of defendant, and affirmed on error by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. (54 C. C. A. 608, 117 Fed. 434.) This writ of error was then allowed.\n The amended complaint was as follows:\n'That the Bankers' Mutual Casualty Company, during all of the year A. D. 1900, and up to the present time, is and was a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the state of Iowa, and a citizen of said state, with its principal place of business at DesMoines, in said state, engaged in the business of insuring banks against loss from robbery and burglary, including the insurance against loss of packages of money while in the course of transmission from place to place, while regularly carried in the United States registered mails.\n\n'That defendant, during all of the year A.

D. 1900, and up to the present time, defendant is and was engaged in carrying the United States mails between the terminal and intermediate stations located upon and along its said line of railroad, under and by virtue of the statutes and laws of the United States, and the regulations established by the Postoffice Department of the United States government, and in pursuance of a fixing of the compensation to be paid to defendant by the United States government for carrying said mails and the person in charge thereof, based upon the last preceding reweighing of said mails and upon notice in writing, in the usual form, from the Second Assistant Postmaster General of the United States, requiring defendant to carry said mails and the person in charge thereof.\n\n'That said depot, at or near the town of Harvey, was an intermediate station on that part of defendant's said line of railroad within the state of North Dakota, which extends from the station at Hankinson to the station at Portal, and the railroad line between said stations at Hankinson and Portal is designated by and known to the Postoffice Department of the United States as railroad route No. 161,018, being a distance of 344.58 miles, and the compensation fixed by the United States Postoffice Department to be paid annually by the United States to defendant during all of the period herein referred to for the carriage of said mails and the person in charge thereof is and was the sum of sixty- four thousand eight hundred and fifteen and 49\/100 dollars ($64,815.49), at the rate of $188.10 per mile. \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n 'That this substituted plaintiff is not in possession of the aforesaid notice to defendant, and is unable to attach to this petition said notice or a true copy thereof.\n\n'That during all of the period hereinbefore referred to there was no contract of any kind between defendant and the United States government, concerning or providing for the carriage, by defendant, of said mails, or any part thereof, or of the person in charge of said mails, upon or along defendant's said line of railway or any part thereof.\n\n'That on or about the 10th day of November, A.

Bright for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller: \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n If the jurisdiction of the circuit court depended entirely on diversity of citizenship, the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was made final by the act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550], and this writ of error must be dismissed. But it is contended that jurisdiction also rested on the ground that the case arose under \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 381]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that must be tested by the settled rule that a suit does not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or some law or treaty of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends, and which appears on the record by plaintiff's own statement of his case in legal and logical form, such as is required in good pleading.

Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, ante, p. 63, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63; Little York Gold-Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, \n96 U.S. 199\n, 24 L. ed. 656; Starin v. New York, \n115 U.S. 248\n, 29 L. ed. 388, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28.\n The amended complaint alleged that defendant was engaged in carrying the mails by virtue of the laws and postal regulations of the United States; that a registered package of currency was deposited in the mails, delivered to the mail clerk on the proper mail car belonging to defendant, duly enclosed with other mail matter in a securely locked mail sack, and transported by defendant to its station at Harvey; that the mail clerk, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, delivered the mail sack, duly locked and containing the registered package of currency, to the night station agent of defendant at the town of Harvey, who was duly authorized by defendant to receive and take charge of all mail matter received there on defendant's railway, neither defendant nor the station agent having taken the oath as officials or employees of the Postoffice Department; and it was then averred:\n'That  713 of the postal laws and regulations of the United States of the year A. D. 1893, which was in force at the time of the receipt and transmission of said registered package, is in words and figures as follows, to wit: 'The railroad company will also be required to take the mails from, and deliver them into, all intermediate postoffices and postal stations located not more than 80 rods from the nearest railroad station at which the company has an agent or other representative employed.' \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 382]\n\u00a0\n 'That said postoffice at Harvey was an intermediate postoffice, and was located not more than 80 rods from defendant's railroad station, or depot, at or near said town of Harvey.\n\n'That under said postal regulation it was the duty of said defendant to provide a sufficient and safe receptacle or place for the safety and security of said mail, while in its said custody; also to safely care for and guard said mail sack and its contents during the night; also to safely deliver the same to the postmaster or postmistress at the postoffice in said town of Harvey, North Dakota.\n\n'But neglecting its said duty in the premises, defendant wholly failed and neglected to provide any receptacle or place for the safe or secure keeping of mail, and also failed to place a duly sworn official in charge of said mail sack, and further wholly failed to safely care for or guard said mail sack and its contents, and also wholly failed to safely deliver the same at the postoffice to the postmaster in said town of Harvey.'\n\n And further, that defendant's road master entered the depot, unlocked the mail bag with a key he had unlawfully caused to be made, abstracted the package of currency, and converted its contents; that the room where the mail bag was placed was 'not designed or capable of safely keeping valuable articles or property,' and that it was through the negligence of defendant and its station agent that the man gained entrance to the room and obtained access to the mail bag.\n It will be perceived that plaintiff relied on principles of general law applicable to negligence, and to the liability of defendant if there were negligence, and nowhere asserted a right which might be defeated or the Constitution or of any law of the United the Constitutionor of any law of the United States. The complaint did indeed deny that there was any contract between defendant and the government, but that was merely a conclusion of law, inconsistent with the statutes and with the facts alleged. And whether the duty counted on was imposed by law, or arose from contract, the question remained whether defendant was a public agent of the United \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 383]\n\u00a0\n States and the consequences of that relation, and the construction of no provision of the Constitution or of any law of the United States on which the recovery depended was put in controversy.\n In other words, no definite issue in respect of a right claimed under the Constitution or any law of the United States was deducible from plaintiff's statement of its case, and if the postal regulations could, under circumstances, be regarded as laws of the United States creating a right which might be denied or secured according to one construction or another, it did not appear that the construction of the extract from  713 of those regulations was in any way in dispute, or could have been. And the averments of the complaint cannot be helped out by resort to the other pleadings or to judicial knowledge. Mountain View Min. & Mill. Co. v. McFadden, \n180 U.S. 533\n, 45 L. ed. 656, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488; Arkansas v. Kansas & T. Coal Co. \n183 U.S. 185\n, 46 L. ed. 144, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47.\n The Constitution empowers Congress to establish postoffices and post roads, and Congress has passed laws accordingly, pursuant to which defendant was carrying the mails. But the alleged cause of action was not referable to those laws or put on the ground that defendant was an officer or public agent of the United States. That was matter of defense and could not be and was not resorted to by plaintiff to obtain jurisdiction. Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 38 L. ed. 511, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654.\n A writ of error to the judgment of a state court stands on different ground. Such was Teal v. Felton, 12 How. 284, 13 L. ed. 390, in which the postmaster relied on an act of Congress in defense, and the writ was properly granted under the 25th section of the judiciary act.\n Cases against United States officers as such, or on bonds given under acts of Congress, or involving interference with Federal process, or the due faith and credit to be accorded judgments, are not in point; nor does the case fall within the ruling that a corporation created by Congress has a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in respect to any litigation it may have except as specially restricted. The \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 384]\n\u00a0\n doctrine of Pennsylvania Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 U.S. 1\n, 29 L. ed. 319, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1113, cannot be extended so as to embrace cases like the present.

Peoria, D. & E. R. Co. \n179 U.S. 335\n, 45 L. ed. 220, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171, show that suits, though involving the Constitution or laws of the United States, are not suits arising under the Constitution or laws where they do not turn on a controversy between the parties in regard to the operation of the Constitution or laws on the facts.\n In Price v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n113 U.S. 218\n, 28 L. ed. 980, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427, which was a writ of error to the supreme court of Pennsylvania, the question arose whether a railway mail clerk was a passenger within a certain statute of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion, said:\n'The plaintiff argues here, and insisted throughout the progress of the case in the state courts, that by reason of certain laws of the United States as applied to the facts found in the verdict of the jury, the decedent was a passenger, and the supreme court erred in holding otherwise. These laws are thus cited in the brief of plaintiff's counsel:\n\n\"Act of March 3, 1865,  8, 13 Stat. at L. 506, chap. 89, provides that 'For the purpose of assorting and distributing letters and other matter in railway postoffices, the Postmaster General may, from time to time, appoint clerks, who shall be paid out of the appropriation for mail transportation.'\n\n\" 4000 Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2719) requires that 'every railway company carrying the mail shall carry on any train which may run over its road, and without extra charge therefor, all mailable matter directed to be carried thereon, with the person in charge of the same.' \n\n[192 U.S. 371, 385]\n\u00a0\n 'We do not think these provisions either aid or govern the construction of the proviso in the Pennsylvania statute.\n\n'The person thus to be carried with the mail matter, without extra charge, is no more a passenger because he is in charge of the mail, nor because no other compensation is made for his transportation, than if he had no such charge; nor does the fact that he is in the employment of the United States, and that defendant is bound, by contract with the government, to carry him, affect the question. It would be just the same if the company had contracted with any other person who had charge of freight on the train to carry him without additional compensation. The statutes of the United States which authorize this employment and direct this service do not, therefore, make the person so engaged a passenger, or deprive him of that character, in construing the Pennsylvania statute. Nor does it give to persons so employed any right as against the railroad company which would not belong to any other person in a similar employment by others than the United States. We are, therefore, of opinion that no question of Federal authority was involved in the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, and the writ of error is accordingly dismissed.'\n\n Although that case was a writ of error to a state court, it was held, in effect, that it was too obvious for controversy that the acts of Congress referred to did not give the mail clerk any particular right as against the railroad company in respect of negligence and therefore this court declined to entertain the writ.\n We repeat that the rule is settled that a case does not arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States unless it appears from plaintiff's own statement, in the outset, that some title, right, privilege, or immunity on which recover depends will be defeated by one construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or sustained by the opposite construction.

CITY OF NEW YORK(1904)\nNo. 159\nArgued: Decided: March 21, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a bill to enjoin the city of New York, the board of rapid transit commissioners for New York, John B. McDonald, and the administratrix of Shaler, deceased, from proceeding with the construction of the rapid transit railroad \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 431]\n\u00a0\n tunnel under Park avenue, New York, adjacent to the premises of Charles T. Barney, 'until the easements appurtenant thereto shall have been acquired according to law and due compensation made therefor to complainant;' and from constructing such railroad otherwise than in accordance with the routes and general plan adopted and approved by the local authorities and by the owners of abutting property, or the appellate division of the supreme court, in lieu thereof.\n From the bill it appeared that the rapid transit board had, on behalf of the city, devised routes and general plans, and entered into a contract for the construction of a rapid transit railroad with McDonald, of whom Ira A. Shaler was a sub-contractor, under the rapid transit acts of the state (Laws 1891, chap. 4; Laws 1892, chaps. 102, 556; Laws 1894, chaps. 528, 752; Laws 1895, chap. 519; Laws 1900, chap. 729; Laws 1901, chap. 587; Laws 1902, chaps. 533, 542, 544, 584).\n Park avenue was one of the streets under which the railroad was authorized to be built, and the routes and general plan of the road were prescribed by the board by resolutions of January 14 and February 4, 1897, which received the assent of the local authorities and of the appellate division of the supreme court in lieu of the consent of the abutting property owners.\n Complainant alleged that he 'consented to the construction of the said rapid transit railroad in accordance with the said routes and general plan of construction, and did not oppose the proceedings hereinafter mentioned, which the said board of rapid transit railroad commissioners instituted for the purpose of obtaining the determination of three commissioners appointed by the said appellate division that such rapid transit railroad ought to be constructed and operated; nor did your orator oppose the confirmation of said determination by the said appellate division.'\n But complainant averred that the portion of the railroad under Park avenue and in front of his premises was being built 27 feet nearer to his premises than was authorized \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n by the routes and general plan; and that the work was 'being thus performed by said defendant McDonald and the said Shaler without any authority other than certain directions given by the chief engineer employed by the board of rapid transit commissioners and embodied in certain so-called working drawings, or detail drawings, prepared by him or at his instance, and recently approved informally by said board. And . . . that the fact that such directions had been given by the chief engineer and that said work was being thus performed by the contractor, as aforesaid, was not until recently specifically known to said board; that such action of said chief engineer and contractor has never been formally or specifically approved by said board; that there has been no change made or authorized by said board in the said 'routes and general plan,' nor has there been any modification of the contract or specification with reference to the construction of that part of the tunnel lying under Park avenue between Thirty-third and Forty-first streets; that no notice was given to any of the property owners along said street that it was proposed by the defendants or any of them to change the position of the tunnel to any material extent from the position shown and described in the said 'routes and general plan,' nor was any opportunity ever given to said property owners or the citizens generally to be heard with respect to any such change.'\n Complainant further averred 'that at none of the times herein mentioned did the said board of rapid transit railroad commissioners have authority (if at all) to enter into any contract for the construction of any rapid transit railroad under or upon the said Park avenue, except in accordance with the said 'routes and general plan' contained in the said resolutions of January 14th and February 4th, 1897, and that at no time did the said board have authority to prepare detailed plans and specifications, except (if at all) in accordance with the said general plan of construction, or to alter any plans or specifications prepared by them, excepting in accordance with said general plan of construction. That the act of the \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n said board in permitting the defendants McDonald and the said Shaler to enter upon that part of Park avenue between Thirty-third and Forty-first streets where the tunnel is now in process of construction, as aforesaid, was illegal and unauthorized, and the defendants McDonald and the said Shaler have entered upon the same unlawfully and without authority; and for the further reason that the construction of the rapid transit railway on the easterly side of Park avenue, in front of your orator's said premises, takes his property without due process of law, in violation of the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that said rapid transit act, so far as it purports to authorize the construction of a tunnel and railway in said Park avenue without the consent of abutting owners or compensation therefor, is void, because it deprives your orator of his property without due process of law, in violation of the provisions of the said amendment.'\n On the bill and affidavits, complainant moved for an injunction pendente lite, and defendants resisted the motion, submitting, in pursuance of stipulation, affidavits filed in their behalf in the case of Huntington v. New York, the same defendants, since brought here, numbered at this term 173, and argued with this case. The opinion in that case (118 Fed. 683) was adopted in this, and the court, of its own motion, under  5 of the act of March 3, 1875, chap 137 [18 Stat. at L. 472, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 511], entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, and certified that question to this court:\n Messrs. Maxwell Evarts and Arthur H. Masten for appellant.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward M. Shepard, Pratt A. Brown, and De Lancey Nicoll for appellees.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 430, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court was invoked upon the ground that, by the tunnel construction sought to be enjoined, complainant was deprived of his property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment. But that amendment prohibits deprivation by a state, and here the bill alleged that what was done was without authority and illegal.\n The city acts through the rapid transit board, which possesses the powers specifically vested. It is empowered to prescribe the routes and general plan of any proposed rapid transit railroad within the city, and every such plan must 'contain such details as to manner of construction as may be necessary to show the extent to which any street, avenue, or other public place is to be encroached upon and the property abutting thereon affected.' Consents of the municipal authorities and the abutting property owners to construction on the routes and plans adopted must be obtained, and any change in the detailed plans and specifications must accord with the general plan of construction, and, if not, like consents must be obtained to such change.\n The bill asserted that the easterly tunnel section under Park avenue was not within the routes and general plan consented to, and that the construction was unauthorized. And this is the view taken by the supreme court of New York. Barney v. Rapid Transit R. Co. 38 Misc. 549, 77 N. Y. Supp. 1083; Barney v. New York, 39 Misc. 719, 80 N. Y. Supp. 972, 83 App. Div. 237, 82 N. Y. Supp. 124.\n Thus, the bill on its face proceeded on the theory that the construction of the easterly tunnel section was not only not authorized, but was forbidden by the legislation, and hence was not action by the state of New York within the intent and meaning of the 14th Amendment, and the circuit court was right in dismissing it for want of jurisdiction.\n Controversies over violations of the laws of New York are \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 438]\n\u00a0\n controversies to be dealt with by the courts of the state. Complainant's grievance was that the law of the state had been broken, and not a grievance inflicted by action of the legislative or executive or judicial department of the state; and the principle is that it is for the state courts to remedy acts of state officers done without the authority of, or contrary to, state law. Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 U.S. 165\n, ante, p. 53, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53; Civil Rights Cases, \n109 U.S. 3\n, 27 L. ed. 835, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18; Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n, 25 L. ed. 667.\n In Virginia v. Rives, referring to an alleged denial of civil rights on account of race and color in the impaneling of a jury, the laws of Virginia in respect of the selection of juries appearing to be unobjectionable, Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for the court, said:\n'It is evident, therefore, that the denial or inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of a state, rights secured to a defendant by any law providing for the equal civil rights of all persons citizens of the United States, of which  641 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 520) speaks, is primarily, if not exclusively, a denial of such rights, or an inability to enforce them, resulting from the Constitution or laws of the state, rather than a denial first made manifest at the trial of the case. In other words, the statute has reference to a legislative denial, or an inability resulting from it. . . .\n\n'When a statute of the state denies his right, or interposes a bar to his enforcing it, in the judicial tribunals, the presumption is fair that they will be controlled by it in their decisions; and in such a case a defendant may affirm on oath what is necessary for a removal. Such a case is clearly within the provisions of  641. But when a subordinate officer of the state, in violation of state law, undertakes to deprive an accused party of a right which the statute law accords to him, as in the case at bar, it can hardly be said that he is denied, or cannot enforce, 'in the judicial tribunals of the state' the rights which belong to him. In such a case it ought to be presumed the court will redress the wrong. If the accused is deprived of the right, the final and practical denial will be in the judicial tribunal which tries the case, after the trial has \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 439]\n\u00a0\n commenced. If, as in this case, the subordinate officer whose duty it is to select jurors fails to discharge that duty in the true spirit of the law; if he excludes all colored men solely because they are colored; or if the sheriff to whom a venire is given, composed of both white and colored citizens, neglects to summon the colored jurors only because they are colored; or if a clerk whose duty it is to take the twelve names from the box rejects all the colored jurors for the same reason,-it can with no propriety be said the defendant's right is denied by the state and cannot be enforced in the judicial tribunals. The court will correct the wrong, will quash the indictment or the panel, or, if not, the error will be corrected in a superior court. We cannot think such cases are within the provisions of  641. Denials of equal rights in the action of the judicial tribunals of the state are left to the revisory powers of this court.'\n\n In the Civil Rights Cases, in which the court was dealing with the act of March 1, 1875, 18 Stat. at L. 335, chap. 114 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1260), Mr. Justice Bradley said:\n'In this connection it is proper to state that civil rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution against state aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by state authority in the shape of laws, customs, or judicial or executive proceedings. The wrongful act of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a private wrong, or a crime of that individual; an invasion of the rights of the injured party, it is true, whether they affect his person, his property, or his reputation; but if not sanctioned in some way by the state, or not done under state authority, his rights remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by resort to the laws of the state for redress.'\n\n There are many cases in this court involving the application of the 11th Amendment which draw the distinction between acts of public officers virtute officii, and their acts without lawful right, colore officii; and in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 U.S. 1\n, 35 L. ed 363, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699, Mr. Justice Lamar defined the two classes to be, \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 440]\n\u00a0\n those brought against officers of the state as representing the state's action and liability, and those against officers of the state when claiming to act as such without lawful authority. The subject is discussed to be, those brought against officers of the Wesley, \n167 U.S. 204\n, 42 L. ed. 137, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 U.S. 516\n, 43 L. ed. 535, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269. Appellant's counsel rely on certain expressions in the opinion in Ex parte Virginia, \n100 U.S. 339\n, 25 L. ed. 676, but that was a case in which what was regarded as the final judgment of a state court was under consideration, and Mr. Justice Strong also said: 'Whoever, by virtue of public position under a state government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the state, and is clothed with the state's power, his act is that of the state.'\n And case Manhattan R. Co. v. New York, 18 Fed. 195; Kiernan v. Multnomah County, 95 Fed. 849; Re Storti, 109 Fed. 807.\n Scott v. McNeal, \n154 U.S. 34\n, 38 L. ed. 896, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1108, and Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, are cited by appellant, but in those cases judgments of the highest judicial tribunals of the state were treated as acts of the state, and no question of the correctness of that view arises here.\n And so in Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n154 U.S. 362\n, 38 L. ed. 1014, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 560, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1047, the general assembly of Texas had established a railroad commission and given it power to fix reasonable rates, with discretion to determine what rates were reasonable. The act provided that suits might be brought by individuals against the commission 'in a court of competent jurisdiction in Travis county, Texas,' and a citizen of another state sued them in the circuit court of the United States for the district which embraced Travis county, and this was held to be authorized by the state statute.\n And as the establishment of rates by the commission was the establishment of rates by the state itself, and the determination of what was reasonable was left to the discretion of the com- \n\n[193 U.S. 430, 441]\n\u00a0\n mission, their action could not be regarded as unauthorized, even though they may have exercised the discretion unfairly.\n Similarly in Pacific Gas Improv. v. Ellert, 64 Fed. 421, where a public board was given power to improve streets, and proceeded in excess of its powers, but not in violation of them, its action was regarded by Mr. Justice McKenna, then circuit judge, as state action.\n In the present case defendants were proceeding, not only in violation of provisions of the state law, but in opposition to plain prohibitions.\n Section 5 of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137 ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), provided that if, in any suit in the circuit court, it should appear, to the satisfaction of the court, at any time, that the suit did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within its jurisdiction, the court should proceed no further, but dismiss the suit. The last paragraph of this section was in terms repealed by the act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. at L. 522, chap. 373, re-enacted August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 515) (the part repealed not being material here), but otherwise the section remained and remains in full force. This case went off on the motion for preliminary injunction, and the bill was properly dismissed, whether treated as if heard on demurrer, or on the proofs by affidavit.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBATES & GUILD CO v. PAYNE(1904)\nNo. 373\nArgued: March 10, 1904Decided: April 11, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. William S. Hall and Holmes Conrad for appellant.\n Messrs. John G. Johnson and Henry H. Glassie for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n This was a bill to compel the recognition by the Postmaster General of the right of the plaintiff corporation to have a periodical publication, known as 'Masters in Music,' received and transmitted through the mails as matter of the second class, and to enjoin defendant from enforcing an order, theretofore made by him, denying it entry as such. This case took the same course as the preceding ones. 31 Wash. L. Rep. 395.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first number of Masters in Music was issued in January, 1903, and an application was immediately made to the Postmaster General for its admission to the mails as second-class mail matter. The application was denied, and plaintiff immediately, and before the issue of another number, filed this bill. The publication purports to be a 'monthly magazine,' \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n salable at 20 cents per number, and to subscribers at $2 a year. The first number is devoted to the works of Mozart and contains a portrait, a biography of four pages, an essay of ten pages upon his art, and thirty- two pages of his music. The preliminary page contained a notice to the effect that 'Masters in Music will be unlike any other musical magazine. Each monthly issue, complete in itself, will be devoted to one of the world's great musicians, giving thirty-two pages of engraved piano music, which will comprise those compositions or movements that represent the composer at his best, with editorial notes suggesting the proper interpretation; a beautiful frontispiece portrait, a life, and estimates of his genius and place in art, chosen from the writings of the most eminent musical critics. The text will thus constitute an interesting and authoritative monthly lesson in musical history; its selections of music will form a library of the world's musical masterpieces, and all at slight cost. . . . The announcement of the contents of the February issue, which will treat of Chopin, will be found on another page.'\n The Postmaster General placed his refusal to allow this magazine to be transmitted as second-class mail matter upon the ground that each number was complete in itself; had no connection with other numbers save in the circumstance that they all treated of masters in music, and that these issues were in fact sheet music disguised as a periodical, and should be classified as third-class mail matter.\n Conceding the principle established in the two cases just decided to be that the fact that books published at stated intervals and in consecutive numbers do not thereby become periodicals, even though in other respects they conform to the requirements of  14 [20 Stat. at L. 359, chap. 180, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2647], cases may still arise where the classification of a certain publication may be one of doubt. Such is this case. But we think that, although the question is largely one of law, determined by a comparison of the exhibit with the statute, there is some discretion left in the Postmaster General with respect to the classification of such publications \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n as mail matter, and that the exercise of such discretion ought not to be interfered with unless the court be clearly of opinion that it was wrong. The Postmaster General is charged with the duty of examining these publications and of determining to which class of mail matter they properly belong; and we think his decision should not be made the subject of judicial investigation in every case where one of the parties thereto is dissatisfied. The consequence of a different rule would be that the court might be flooded by appeals of this kind to review the decision of the Postmaster General in every individual instance. In the case of American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 \nU.S. 94, 104\n, 47 S. L. ed. 90, 94, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33, the Postoffice authorities were held to have acted beyond their authority in rejecting all correspondence with the plaintiff upon the subject of the treatment of diseases by mental action; but while it was said in that case that the question involved was a legal one, it was intimated that something must be left to the discretion of the Postmaster General.\n It has long been the settled practice of this court in land cases to treat the findings of the Land Department upon questions of fact as conclusive, although such proceedings involve to a certain extent, the exercise of judicial power. As was said in Burfenning v. Chicago, St. P. M . & O. R. Co. \n163 \nU.S. 321, 323\n, 41 S. L. ed. 175, 176, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1018, 1019: 'Whether, for instance, a certain tract is swamp land or not, saline land or not, mineral land or not, presents a question of fact not resting on record, dependent on oral testimony; and it cannot be doubted that the decision of the Land Department, one way or the other, in reference to these questions, is conclusive, and not open to relitigation in the courts, except in those cases of fraud, etc., which permit any determination to be reexamined' (citing cases). See also Johnson v. Drew, \n171 U.S. 93\n, 43 L. ed. 88, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 800; Gardner v. Bonestell, \n180 U.S. 362\n, 45 L. ed. 574, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399.\n But there is another class of cases in which the rule is somewhat differently, and perhaps more broadly, stated, and that is, that where Congress has committed to the head of a department certain duties requiring the exercise of judgment \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n and discretion, his action thereon, whether it involve questions of law or fact, will not be reviewed by the courts unless he has exceeded his authority or this court should be of opinion that his action was clearly wrong. In the early case of Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 497, 10 L. ed. 599, it was said that the official duties of the head of an executive department, whether imposed by act of Congress or resolution, are not mere ministerial duties; and, as was said by this court in the recent case of United States ex rel. Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 324\n, 47 L. ed. 1076, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 702: 'Whether he decided right or wrong is not the question. Having jurisdiction to decide at all, he had necessarily jurisdiction, and it was his duty to decide as he thought the law was, and the courts have no power whatever, under those circumstances, to review his determination by mandamus or injunction.'\n In Marquez v. Frisbie, \n101 U.S. 473\n, 25 L. ed. 800, which was a bill in equity to review the decision of the Land Department in a pre-emption case, Mr. Justice Miller remarked (p. 476, L. ed. p. 801): 'This means, and it is a sound principle, that where there is a mixed question of law and fact, and the court cannot so separate it as to see clearly where the mistake of law is, the decision of the tribunal to which the law had confided the matter is conclusive.' In Gaines v. Thompson, 7 Wall. 347, 19 L. ed. 62, it was held that the court would no more interfere by injunction than by mandamus to control the action of the head of a department; and in United States ex rel. Dunlap v. Black, \n128 U.S. 40\n, 32 L. ed. 354, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 12, it was said that the courts will not interfere by mandamus with the executive officers of the government in the exercise of their ordinary official duties, even where those duties require an interpretation of the law, no appellate power being given them for that purpose. See also United States ex rel. Redfield v. Windom, \n137 U.S. 636\n, 34 L. ed. 811, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 197.\n The rule upon this subject may be summarized as follows: That where the decision of questions of fact is committed by Congress to the judgment and discretion of the head of a department, his decision thereon is conclusive; and that even upon mixed questions of law and fact, or of law alone, his action will carry with it a strong presumption of its correctness, and \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n the courts will not ordinarily review it, although they may have the power, and will occasionally exercise the right of so doing.\n Upon this principle, and because we thought the question involved one of law rather than of fact, and one of great general importance, we have reviewed the action of the Postmaster General in holding serial novels to be books rather than periodicals; but it is not intended to intimate that in every case hereafter arising the question whether a certain publication shall be considered a book or a periodical shall be reviewed by this court. In such case the decision of the Postoffice Department, rendered in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, will be treated as conclusive.\n In the case of Masters in Music the question really is whether a pamphlet, complete in itself, treating of the works of a single master, with a greater part of the pamphlet devoted to specimens of his genius, shall be controlled by the cover, which declared that these numbers will be issued monthly, at a certain subscription price per year. Although a comparison of the exhibit with the statute may raise only a question of law, the action of the Postmaster General may have been, to a certain extent, guided by extraneous information obtained by him, so that the question involved would not be found merely a question of law, but a mixed question of law and fact. While, as already observed, the question is one of doubt, we think the decision of the Postmaster General, who is vested by Congress with the power to exercise his judgment and discretion in the matter, should be accepted as final. The decree of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan (with whom concurred the CHIEF JUSTICE) dissenting:\n The Chief Justice and myself are of opinion that the publication here in question is second-class mailable matter, and can- \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n not concur in the opinion and judgment of the court. Our reasons for dissenting are stated in the opinion filed by us in Houghton v. Payne ( just decided), 193 U. S. --, ante, 590, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590.\n But there are some things in the opinion of the court in this case to which we shall advert. It is said that the case is one of doubt. Now, it was admitted at the bar by the government that the publication known as 'Masters in Music' would be carried in the mails as second-class matter if the question be decided in accordance with the construction placed upon the statute by the Department for more than sixteen years continuously prior to the present ruling of the Department. We had supposed it to be firmly settled that the established practice of an executive department charged with the execution of a statute will be respected and followed- especially if it has been long continued-unless such practice rests upon a construction of the statute which is clearly and obviously wrong. In United States v. Philbrick, \n120 U.S. 59\n, 30 L. ed. 561, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413, which involved the construction placed by an executive department upon an act of Congress, this court said: 'Since it is not clear that that construction was erroneous, it ought not now to be overturned.' So in United States v. Healey, \n160 U.S. 145\n, 40 L. ed. 372, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247, the court said that it would accept the uniform interpretation by the Interior Department of an act relating to the public lands, 'as the true one, if, upon examining the statute, we found its meaning to be at all doubtful or obscure.' The authorities to that effect are numerous. Edwards v. Darby, 12 Wheat. 206, 6 L. ed. 603; Hahn v. United States, \n107 U.S. 402\n, 27 L. ed. 527, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494; United States v. Graham, \n110 U.S. 219\n, 28 L. ed. 126, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582; Brown v. United States, \n113 U.S. 571\n, 28 L. ed. 1080, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648; United States v. Philbrick, \n120 U.S. 59\n, 30 L. ed. 561, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413; United States v. Johnston, \n124 U.S. 236\n, 31 L. ed. 415, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495; United States v. Hill, \n120 U.S. 183\n, 30 L. ed. 632, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510; United States v. Finnell, \n185 U.S. 236\n, 46 L. ed. 890, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633; United States v. Alabama G. S. R. Co. \n142 U.S. 615\n, 35 L. ed. 1134, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306; Hewitt v. Schultz, \n180 \nU.S. 139, 157\n, 45 S. L. ed. 463, 472, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 309. Some of them are cited in the opinion of the court in Houghton v. Payne. The rule of construction which this court has recognized for more than three quarters of a century is now overthrown. For, it is adjudged that the prac- \n\n[194 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n tice of the Postoffice Department, covering a period of sixteen years and more, need not be regarded in this case, although the construction of the statute in question is admitted to be doubtful. We cannot give our assent to this view. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEAVERS v. HENKEL(1904)\nNo. 535\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1904\n\n\n\n\n On July 23, 1903, a grand jury of the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of New York found and returned an indictment under  1781, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1212), charging George W. Beavers, and officer of the government of the United States, with having received money for procuring a contract with the government for the Edward J. Brandt-Dent Company. A warrant for the arrest of the official was issued to the marshal of the district, and returned 'not found.' Thereupon a complaint, supported by affidavit, was filed in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, alleging the finding of the indictment, the issue \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 74]\n\u00a0\n of the warrant, the return 'not found,' and that Beavers was within the southern district of New York. Upon this complaint a warrant was issued, Beavers was arrested and brought before a commissioner. A hearing was had before that officer, and upon his report the district judge of the southern district signed an order of removal to the eastern district. Before this order could be executed Beavers presented his petition to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York for a writ of habeas corpus. After a hearing thereon the application for discharge was denied, and thereupon an appeal was taken to this court.\nMessrs. Max D. Stener, Bankson T. Morgan, and William M. Seabury for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 73, 80]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 73, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case turns upon the efficacy of an indictment in removal proceedings. The government offered no other evidence of petitioner's guilt. His counsel state in their brief:\n'The controlling questions to be discussed on this appeal are whether the indictment offered in evidence before the commissioner can be regarded as conclusive evidence against the accused of the facts therein alleged; whether it was competent at all as evidence of such facts, and whether such indictment was entitled to be accorded any probative force whatever.'\n\n At the outset it is well to note that this is not a case of extradition. There was no proposed surrender of petitioner by the United States to the jurisdiction of a foreign nation, no abandonment of the duty of protection which the nation owes to all \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 83]\n\u00a0\n within its territory. There was not even the qualified extradition which arises when one state within the Union surrenders to another an alleged fugitive from its justice. There was simply an effort on the part of the United States to subject a citizen found within its territory to trial before one of its own courts. The locality in which an offence is alleged to have been committed determines, under the Constitution and laws, the place and court of trial. And the question is, What steps are necessary to bring the alleged offender to that place and before that court?\n Obviously, very different considerations are applicable to the two cases. In an extradition the nation surrendering relies for future protection of the alleged offender upon the good faith of the nation to which the surrender is made; while here the full protecting power of the United States is continued after the removal from the place of arrest to the place of trial. It may be conceded that no such removal should be summarily and arbitrarily made. There are risks and burdens attending it which ought not to be needlessly cast upon any individual. These may not be serious in a removal from New York to Brooklyn, but might be if the removal was from San Francisco to New York. And statutory provisions must be interpreted in the light of all that may be done under them. We must never forget that in all controversies, civil or criminal, between the government and an individual, the latter is entitled to reasonable protection. Such seems to have been the purpose of Congress in enacting  1014, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716), which requires that the order of removal be issued by the judge of the district in which the defendant is arrested. In other words, the removal is made a judicial rather than a mere ministerial act.\n In the light of these considerations we pass to an inquiry into the special matters here presented. Article 5 of the amendments to the Constitution provides:\n'No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 84]\n\u00a0\n or in the militia, when an actual service in time of war or public danger.'\n\n While many states, in the exercise of their undoubted sovereignty ( Hurtado v. California, \n110 U.S. 516\n, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292), have provided for trials of criminal offences upon information filed by the prosecuting officer, and without any previous inquiry or action by a grand jury, the national Constitution, in its solicitude for the protection of the individual, requires an indictment as a prerequisite to a trial. The grand jury is a body known to the common law, to which is committed the duty of inquiring whether there be probable cause to believe the defendant guilty of the offense charged. Blackstone says (vol. 4, p. 303):\n'This grand jury are previously instructed in the articles of their inquiry, by a charge from the judge who presides upon the bench. They then withdraw, to sit and receive indictments, which are preferred to them in the name of the King, but at the suit of any private prosecutor; and they are only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecution; for the finding of an indictment is only in the nature of an inquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be tried and determined; and the grand jury are only to inquire, upon their oaths, whether there be sufficient cause to call upon the party to answer it. A grand jury, however, ought to be thoroughly persuaded of the truth of an indictment, so far as their evidence goes; and not to rest satisfied merely with remote probabilities: a doctrine that might be applied to very oppressive purposes.'\n\n The thought is that no one shall be subjected to the burden and expense of a trial until there has been a prior inquiry and adjudication by a responsible tribunal that there is probable cause to believe him guilty. But the Constitution does not require two such inquiries and adjudications. The government, having once satisfied the provision for an inquiry, and obtained an adjudication by the proper tribunal of the existence of probable cause, ought to be able, without further litigation concerning that fact, to bring the party charged into \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 85]\n\u00a0\n court for trial. The existence of probable cause is not made more certain by two inquiries and two indictments. Within the spirit of the rule of giving full effect to the records and judicial proceedings of other courts, an indictment, found by the proper grand jury should be accepted everywhere through the United States as at least prima facie evidence of the existence of probale cause. And the place where such inquiry must be had and the decision of a grand jury obtained is the locality in which, by the Constitution and laws, the final trial must be had.\n While the indictment is prima facie evidence, it is urged that there are substantial reasons why it should not be regarded as conclusive. An investigation before the grand jury, it is said, is generally ex parte- although sometimes witnesses in behalf of the defendant are heard by it- and the conclusion of such ex parte inquiry ought not to preclude the defendant from every defense, even the one that he was never within the state or district in which the crime is charged to have been committed, or authorize the government to summarily arrest him wherever he may be found, transport him, perhaps, far away from his home, and subject him, among strangers, to the difficulties and expense of making his defense. It is unnecessary to definitely determine this question. It is sufficient for this case to decide, as we do, that the indictment is prima facie evidence of the existence of probable cause. This is not in conflict with the views expressed by this court in Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 249\n, 46 L. ed. 177, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218. There it appeared that after an indictment had been found by a grand jury of the United States district court for the southern district of Georgia the defendants were arrested in New York; that on a hearing before the commissioner he ruled that the indictment was conclusive evidence of the existence of probable cause, and declined to hear any testimony offered by the defendants. Upon an application to the district judge in New York for a removal, he held that the indictment was not conclusive and sent the case back to the commissioner. Thereupon testimony was offered \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 86]\n\u00a0\n before the commissioner, who found that there was probable cause to believe the defendant guilty, and upon his report the district judge ordered a removal. We held that, under the circumstances, it was not necessary to determine the sufficiency of the indictment as evidence of the existence of probable cause, and that as the district judge found that probable cause was shown it was enough to justify a removal.\n It is further contended that--\n'There was no jurisdiction to apprehend the accused, because the complaint on removal was jurisdictionally defective, in that it was made entirely upon information, without alleging a sufficient or competent source of the affiant's information, and ground for his belief, and without assigning any reason why the affidavit of the person or persons having knowledge of the facts alleged was not secured.'\n\n This contention cannot be sustained. The complaint alleges on information and belief that Beavers was an officer of the government of the United States in the office of the First Assistant Postmaster General of the United States; that, as such officer, he was charged with the consideration of allowances for expenditures, and with the procuring of contracts with and from persons proposing to furnish supplies to the said Postoffice Department; that he made a fraudulent agreement with the Edward J. Brandt-Dent Company for the purchase of automatic cashiers for the Postoffice Department and received pay therefor; that an indictment had been found by the grand jury of the eastern district, a warrant issued and returned 'not found,' and that the defendant was within the southern district of New York. This complaint was supported by affidavit, in which it was said:\n'Deponent further says that the sources of his information are the official documents with reference to the making of the said contract and the said transactions on file in the records of the United States of America and in the Postoffice Department thereof and letters and communications from the Edward J. Brandt-Dent Company with reference to the said contract, \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 87]\n\u00a0\n and from the indictment, a certified copy of which is referred to in said affidavit as Exhibit A, and the bench warrant therein referred to as Exhibit B, and from personal conversations with the parties who had the various transactions with the said George W. Beavers in relation thereto; and that his information as to the whereabouts of the said George W. Beavers is derived from a conversation had with the said George W. Beavers in said southern district of New York in the past few days, and from the certificate of the United States marshal for the eastern district of New York, indorsed on said warrant.'\n\n This disclosure of the sources of information was sufficient. In Rice v. Ames, \n180 U.S. 371\n, 45 L. ed. 577, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406, a case of extradition to a foreign country, in which the complaint was made upon information and belief, we said (p. 375, L. ed. p. 581, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 408):\n'If the officer of the foreign government has no personal knowledge of the facts, he may, with entire propriety, make the complaint upon information and belief, stating the sources of his information and the grounds of his belief, and annexing to the complaint a properly certified copy of any indictment or equivalent proceeding which may have been found in the foreign country, or a copy of the depositions of witnesses having actual knowledge of the facts, taken under the treaty and act of Congress. This will afford ample authority to the commissioner for issuing the warrant.'\n\n The indictment alone was, as we have seen, a showing of probable cause sufficient to justify the issue of a warrant.\n With reference to other questions we remark that, so far as respects technical objections, the sufficiency of the indictment is to be determined by the court in which it was found, and is not a matter of inquiry in removal proceedings (Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 249\n, 46 L. ed. 177, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218); that the defendant has there no right to an investigation of the proceedings before the grand jury, or an inquiry concerning what testimony was presented to, or what witnesses were heard by, that body. In other words, he may not impeach an indictment by evidence tending to show that the grand jury did not have testimony before it sufficient to \n\n[194 U.S. 73, 88]\n\u00a0\n justify its action. Such seems to have been the purpose of most, if not all, of the testimony offered by the petitioner in this case. As his counsel stated during the progress of the examination before the commissioner: 'We hold that we have an absolute right in a proper proceeding to expose what took place before the grand jury. We don't do it at all in order to make a disclosure of what transpired before a secret body. We do propose to show what transpired before that grand jury so as to show that there was not any evidence upon which that body could have found an indictment,-a legal, valid, lawful indictment-against George W. Beavers. We have no other purpose in calling this witness or any other witness who appeared before the grand jury.' But the sufficiency of an indictment as evidence of probable cause in removal proceedings cannot be impeached (if impeachable at all) in any such manner. Neither can a defendant in this way ascertain what testimony the government may have against him, and thus prepare the way for his defense. There are no other questions that seem to us to require notice.\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEDFORD v. U S(1904)\nNo. 23\nArgued: December 9, 1903Decided: January 18, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The appellants were owners of land on the Mississippi river in the state of Louisiana, amounting to 5,000 or 6,000 acres, upon which were cabins, other buildings, and fences. They brought suit in the court of claims for damages to their lands, alleged to have resulted from certain works of the United States. The damages consisted, as found by the court, of the erosion and overflow of about 2,300 acres of the land. The works of the government, and their operation, are described by the court in the following findings:\n'Prior to the spring of 1876 the Mississippi river flowed \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n around a narrow neck of land known as De Soto point; and, in going around this point, flowed by the city of Vicksburg in a southwesterly direction. In the spring of 1876 De Soto point became so narrow by erosion that the river broke through, leaving De Soto point as an island, thereby shortening the distance of the stream about 6 miles, and taking its course immediately to the south with great velocity against the Mississippi bank at what is known as the cut-off of 1876. The result was that the city of Vicksburg was left some miles away from the main channel of the river, and the old channel in front of the city was continually filled up, making the approach from the river to the docks along the river difficult, if not impossible.\n\n'Between 1878 and 1884 the United States constructed about 10,700 feet of revetment along the banks of the Mississippi river at Delta point, Louisiana, for the purpose of preventing the further erosion of that point. The revetment consisted of willow mattresses weighted down by stones, and were placed on sand banks below high-water mark. The revetment was neither upon nor in contact with the claimant's land. The object of the construction was to prevent the navigable channel of the river from receding farther from the city of Vicksburg, which had been left some distance from the main channel of the river by the cut-off of 1876, as aforesaid. The revetment was repaired slightly in 1866 and 1889, and more extensively in 1894, all of which work was paid for from time to time out of the appropriations made therefor by Congress, as found in 20 Stat. at L. 363, 366, chap. 181; 21 Stat. at L. 181, chap. 211; 21 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 136; 26 Stat. at L. 450, chap. 907; 26 Stat. at L. 1116\n\n\n\n'In making the improvement aforesaid, the defendants did not recognize any right of property in the claimants in and to the right alleged to be affected, and did not assume to take private property in and by the construction of the revetment, but proceeded in the exercise of a claimed right to improve the navigation of the river.\n\n'After the cut-off at De Soto point in 1876, and the construction of the revetment, as aforesaid, the channel and cur- \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n rent of the Mississippi river were gradually directed toward the lands of the claimants, situated about 6 miles below said cut-off, and did about the year 1882, reach said lands and thereafter erode and overflow about 2, 300 acres of their lands, which overflow has ever since continued. About 400 acres of their lands so eroded and overflowed was prior to the death of said George M. Bedford, through whom the claimants claim title, and about 900 acres of which were overflowed thereafter and prior to said judicial sale, and the residue after said sale. Of the lands so overflowed about 1,300 acres thereof were cleared and in cultivation, of which about 700 acres were so cleared prior to May 2, 1895.\n\n'The damage to the claimants, and each of them, by reason of the washing away of their lands during their respective ownership, as aforesaid, is an excess of $3,000.\n\n'The cause of the deflection of the river upon the claimants' land was the cut-off, which shortened the distance of the stream 6 miles, and thereby increased the velocity of the current, and forced the current to turn, when it struck the Mississippi bank, at an abrupt angle. The revetment did not change the course of the river as it then existed, but operated to keep the course of the river at that point as it then was. If the revetment had not been built, the cut-off would have continued to widen toward the Louisiana bank, and the channel would have continued to move in the same direction. With the widening of the cut-off and the shifting of the channel the angle of the turn below the cut-off would have gradually become less abrupt, and the deflection of the stream upon the claimants' land would have grown less, and the consequent injury to the claimants' land would have been decreased. To what extent the injury would have been decreased is conjectural. The injury done to the claimants' land was an effect of natural causes; the injury caused by the government was by interrupting the further progress of natural causes, i. e., the further change in the course of the river, and is also conjectural.'\n\n The court deduced from the facts that the claimants were \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n not entitled to recover, and dismissed their petitions. 36 Ct. Cl. 474.\n Messrs. John C. Chaney, E. T. Brook shire, and Dabney & McCabe for appellants.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. William H. Button for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n There is no dispute about the power of the government to construct the works which, it is claimed, caused the damage to appellants' land. It was alleged by appellants that they were constructed by the 'United States in the execution of its rights and powers in and over said river, and in pursuance of its lawful control over the navigation of said river, and for the betterment and improvement thereof.' And also that the works were not constructed upon appellants' land, and their immediate object was to prevent further erosion at De Soto point. In other words, the object of the works was to preserve the conditions made by natural causes. By constructing works to secure that object, appellants contend there was given to them a right to compensation. The contention asserts a right in a riparian proprietor to the unrestrained operation of natural causes, and that works of the government which resist or disturb those causes, if injury result to riparian owners, have the effect of taking private property for public uses within the meaning of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The consequences of the contention immediately challenge its soundness. What is its limit? Is only the government so restrained? Why not as well riparian pro- \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n prietors, arel they also forbidden to resist natural causes, whatever devastation by floods or erosion threaten their property? Why, for instance, would not, under the principle asserted, the appellants have had a cause of action against the owner of the land at the cut-off if he had constructed the revetment? And if the government is responsible to one landowner below the works, why not to all landowners? The principle contended for seems necessarily wrong. Asserting the rights of riparian property, it might make that property valueless. Conceding the power of the government over navigable rivers, it would make that power impossible of exercise, or would prevent its exercise by the dread of an immeasurable responsibility.\n There is another principle by which the rights of riparian property and the power of the government over navigable rivers are better accommodated. It is illustrated in many cases.\n The Constitution provides that private property shall not be taken without just compensation, but a distinction has been made between damage and taking, and that distinction must be observed in applying the constitutional provision. An excellent illustration is found in Gibson v. United States, \n166 U.S. 269\n, 41 L. ed. 996, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578. The distinction is there instructively explained, and other cases need not be cited. It is, however, necessary to refer to United State v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349, as it is especially relied upon by appellants. The facts are stated in the following excerpt from the opinion:\n'It appears from the 5th finding, as amended, that a large portion of the land flooded was, in its natural condition, between high-water mark and low-water mark, and was subject to overflow as the water passed from one stage to the other; that this natural overflow was stopped by an embankment, and in lieu thereof, by means of flood gates, the land was flooded and drained at the will of the owner. From this it is contended that the only result of the raising of the level of the river by the government works was to take away the \n\n[192 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n possibility of drainage. But findings IX. and X. show that, both by seepage and percolation through the embankment and an actual flowing upon the plantation above the obstruction the water has been raised in the plantation about 18 inches; that it is impossible to remove this overflow of water, and, as a consequence, the property has become an irreclaimable bog, unfit for the purpose of rice culture or any other known agriculture, and deprived of all value. It is clear from these findings that what was a valuable rice plantation has been permanently flooded, wholly destroyed in value, and turned into an irreclaimable bog; and this as the necessary result of the work which the government has undertaken.'\n\n The question was asked: 'Does this amount to a taking?' To which it was replied: 'The case of Pumpelly v. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. 13 Wall. 166, 20 L. ed. 557, answers this question in the affirmative.' And further: 'The Green Bay Company, as authorized by statute, constructed a dam across Fox river, by means of which the land of Pumpelly was overflowed and rendered practically useless to him. There, as here, no proceedings had been taken to formally condemn the land.' In both cases, therefore, it was said that there was an actual invasion and appropriation of land as distinguished from consequential damage. In the case at bar the damage was strictly consequential. It was the result of the action of the river through a course of years. The case at bar, therefore, is distinguishable from the Lynah Case in the cause and manner of the injury. In the Lynah Case the works were constructed in the bed of the river, obstructed the natural flow of its water, and were held to have caused, as a direct consequence, the overflow of Lynah's plantation. In the case at bar the works were constructed along the banks of the river, and their effect was to resist erosion of the banks by the waters of the river. There was no other interference with natural conditions. Therefore, the damage to appellants' land, if it can be assigned to the works at all, was but an incidental consequence of them.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBENZIGER v. U S(1904)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Certain figures representing various saints, and also two figures of adoring angels, as specified in the collector's letter to the board of general appraisers, were, in March, 1899, spe- \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n cially imported into the port of New York in good faith, for the use and by the order of societies incorporated or established solely for religious purposes. The importers claimed the figures were entitled to free entry under paragraph 649 of the tariff act of 1897. (30 Stat. at L. 151, 201, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1626, 1687.) The appraiser returned them as 'church statues, composed of plaster of Paris, decorated,' or as 'articles and wares composed wholly or in chief value of earthy or mineral substances, not specially provided for,' and the collector assessed upon them a duty of 45 and 35 per cent ad valorem under paragraphs 97 and 450 of the same act (pages 156, 193).1 If dutiable, no question is made as to the correctness of the decision of the collector in assessing the duties as he did. The contention is that these figures were 'specially provided for' in this act under the paragraph above mentioned, 649.\n The importers protested against the decision of the collector, and the case went to the board of general appraisers. Testimony was taken by the board and it found as a fact the manner in which the figures were made, which was as follows:\n'The clay model of the subject, of desired size, is covered by a workman with a coating some two inches thick of plaster of Paris. When this coating has 'set' or hardened sufficiently, the clay figure inside is broken up and removed, and a plaster of Paris mould thereof thus obtained. Plaster is then carefully forced into this mould, and when dry is taken out in the form of the original clay figure. This plaster figure, after having been carefully gone over by an artist or skilled workman to cure any defects in the moulding, is in turn thoroughly covered with specially prepared plaster for the final mould. This is made in sections, which when dry are removed, and together form a perfect mould, and this composite mould becomes the manufacturer's substitute for the artist's clay or plaster cast model from which he (the manufacturer) produces his moulded statues in unlimited numbers. In the moulding process the several sections of the mould are in turn laid with the concave side upward, and have a lining of 'carton pierre,' \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n one-half inch or more in thickness, carefully laid and pressed into them by the moulder's hands with the aid of suitable tools. The extended arms, fingers, and other slender parts are strengthened by pieces of iron wire laid in the 'carton pierre,' which is then lined either with heavy paper or coarse woven vegetable fiber cloth secured with glue. After the 'carton pierre' has dried sufficiently, the several sections of the mould are removed and their contents joined together around a framework of wood, and a figure is thus formed, the counterpart of the original model. The statue then goes to a skilled workman called a 'finisher,' who, with knife or other instrument removes any roughness resulting from the joining of the sections, cures any other defects in the moulding, and smooths it down generally. It is then passed to the painter and decorator, who completes it in the style desired. The statues in 'carton romain' and in 'stone composition' are made in the same manner, except that the latter are uniformly lined with coarse cloth. The stations of the cross in 'carton pierre' and in terra cotta are produced in substantially the same way ( those in terra cotta, however, being kiln dried or baked after moulding), and are painted and decorated in quite the same manner as the statues, the foreground and other landscape or perspective effects being painted in suitable tints or hues.'\n\n The protest was overruled by the board, and a petition for a review was duly filed by the importers (petitioners) and the case heard in the circuit court, southern district of New York, and that court affirmed the decision of the board. 107 Fed. 257. An appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals, where the decision of the circuit court was affirmed on the opinion of the court below. Upon petition of the importers a writ of certiorari was issued from this court, and the case brought here for review.\n Messrs. W. Wickham Smith and Charles Curie for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioners claim that the figures in question here are entitled to free entry under the provision of paragraph 649 of the tariff act of 1897 (30 Stat. at L. 151, 201, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1626, 1687), as being 'casts of sculpture, where specially imported, in good faith, for the use and by order of any society incorporated or established solely for religious, philosophical, educational, scientific, or literary purposes,' etc. The board of appraisers thought that on July 24, 1897, the day of the passage of the tariff act, and for many years prior thereto, those figures belonged to a class which was known in commerce, in art, and to the classifying officers of customs of the United States as 'statuary,' and specifically as 'church statuary.' In the opinion of the board it was stated: \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n 'It is the practice of professional sculptors to have their original creations in clay reproduced in plaster of Paris for permanent use as models from which the objects are sculptured in marble, stone or other material. The sculptor invariably goes over his plaster cast with utmost care, not only repairing any defects in the moulding, but defining more accurately the hair, finger nails, folds of the drapery, and outline generally, and, above all, perfecting the facial and general expression. These plaster of Paris models are known in commerce and in art as 'casts of sculpture.' They represent the artist's right and title to his creation, and unlike the merchandise in question here, are not painted and decorated, nor dealt in as ordinary commercial articles. Casts in plaster of Paris are likewise produced from rare objects of sculpture, generally for use in museums or art institutions, but sometimes for reproduction by sculptors in marble, stone, etc., and are also called 'casts of sculpture,' but are in strict sense 'casts from sculpture,' being cast from plaster of Paris from sculptural objects, such, for example, as the high relief frieze of the Parthenon at Athens, the facade of the guild of the Butchers house at Hildesheim, the tomb of Englebert, and other works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art mentioned in the testimony of Messrs. Stoltzenberg and Trueg.'\n The board was of opinion that these figures were what is known in commerce, in art, and in common speech as 'statuary,' and were not 'specimens or casts of sculpture,' and were therefore assessed, as stated.\n If these figures were to be entered as statuary, they would come in free under paragraph 649 of the act of 1897, but for the limitation contained in paragraph 454, which limits the term 'statuary,' as used in the act, so as to 'include only such statuary as is cut, carved, or otherwise wrought by hand from a solid block or mass of marble, stone, or alabaster or from metal, and as is the professional production of a statuary or sculptor only.' The circuit court did not regard it necessary in the disposition of the case to determine whether these particular \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n figures would come in free as casts of sculpture under paragraph 649, if imported in the crude state, but held that as the figures had been painted and gilded, they were not thereafter casts of sculpture within the meaning of the act.\n Upon the argument of this case at bar frequent reference was made by counsel to the provisions in former tariff acts upon this subject, as bearing upon the proper construction of the one under consideration. For convenience these provisions are reproduced in the margin as they existed in the act of 1861 (12 Stat. at L. 178, 193, chap. 68); the Rev. Stat. ( 2505, pp. 482, 487, 488); the act of 1883 (22 Stat. at L. 488, 514, 520, chap. 121); the act of 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 567, 608, 609, chap. 1244); the act of 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 509, 543, 544, chap. 349); and in the present act of 1897 (30 Stat. at L. 151, 201, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1626, 1687). \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n An examination of the provisions of the various statutes shows a somewhat uniform purpose on the part of Congress to provide free entry to casts of marble, bronze, alabaster, or plaster of Paris, and also statuary and specimens of sculpture, when specially imported, in good faith, for the societies enumerated in the acts. It is also seen that under the language used in these different paragraphs, which may be described as the 'philosophical and scientific,' and the 'regalia and gems' \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n paragraphs, some article might be admitted under either paragraph. There is no doubt that under the tariff acts prior to that of 1897, these figures could have been admitted free of duty, as 'casts of plaster of Paris.' Indeed, the Treasury Department had so decidedin a case hereafter cited. Those words, 'casts of marble, bronze, alabaster, or plaster of Paris,' which appear in all the statutes cited prior to 1897, in the philosophical apparatus paragraphs, are left out in the \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n act of 1897, paragraph 638, and it is therefore urged that the figures are not entitled to free entry, as they are not casts of sculpture, provided for in paragraph 649. The question is, therefore, whether the omission of those words in paragraph 638 prevents the free entry of these figures, or are they properly described as casts of sculpture, and therefore entitled to free entry under paragraph 649.\n We do not attach any very great importance, as evidence of the intention of Congress, to the omission in the act of 1897 above referred to. The language used in paragraph 649 is very broad, including all casts of sculpture, as well those heretofore mentioned in paragraphs in prior statutes similar to paragraph 638 as others. The omission in the latter paragraph was, therefore, immaterial if these figures are casts of sculpture. Although they might heretofore have come in under the designation of 'casts of plaster of Paris' as contained in former paragraphs, we think they also might have come in under the designation 'casts of sculpture' contained in the act of 1894 as well as in the act of 1897, and that it was not intended by Congress, in omitting the words in the latter act as to casts of plaster of Paris, in paragraph 638, to prevent their free entry under paragraph 649. The language in paragraph 638 was simply unnecessary in a case where the same articles were entitled to free entry under another paragraph.\n In attempting to understand the true construction of the words used in the act of 1897 we are not very greatly aided by the opinions given by various artists called by the government and contained in this record, as to what was the proper designation of the figures. These opinions varied, although based upon conceded facts as to the manner and process by which the figures were produced. According to some of them there were but two kinds of 'casts of sculpture;' one where professional sculptures have their own original creations of clay reproduced in plaster of Paris for permanent use as models, and from which objects are sculptured in marble, stone, or other material; and the other, where casts in plaster of Paris are \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n produced from rare objects of sculpture, generally for use in museums or art institutes. Some regarded the term 'sculpture so wide that it was difficult to define definitely,' although they thought that the figures in question were not casts of sculpture, while some regarded casts of sculpture 'as such classes of plaster casts or clay or marble or bronze as are to stand singly and alone, and not be sold in endless numbers, and to be exhibited temporarily in some exhibition.' We think the last definition is inaccurate and inadmissible. Under this view, whether a figure is a cast of sculpture or not, does not in the least depend upon how it is made. It is the use to which it is destined which is to determine what it is in fact. If there are to be a great many of them, to be 'sold in endless numbers,' they are not casts of sculpture, no matter how they are made, and if they are to 'stand singly' and 'be exhibited temporarily' then they are such casts. We are not satisfied as to the correctness or completeness of this definition. Whether in one case the cast is for the use of the sculptor only or in the other is destined to be reproduced indefinitely, we think is not material. They are made in the same manner, reproduced from clay, and the same means or process is taken or employed in obtaining the result. Whether the clay model is the work of the superior genius of a great sculptor or is the result of the efforts of one who could not be classed as a genius at all, they are both fashioned in the same way and the same process is followed with regard to both, and we do not think that in this statute there was any intention to confine the meaning to casts of those clay figures which were fashioned by the hand of genius, while excluding those of inferior artists or workmen. The witnesses are not, however, all of one mind, even upon the meaning of the term. Some thought that these were casts of sculpture in a certain sense as long as they remained simply plaster casts, but just as soon as additional touches were given to the casts, in the way of paint or ornamentation, the casts lost their original character as plaster casts and became statuary in wood or alabaster or bronze. \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 49]\n\u00a0\n At any rate, it would cease to be an article of clay and would become a finished thing. Just as soon as a cast of sculpture was painted it would, in the opinion of some of the witnesses, cease to be a cast of sculpture.\n Some of the artists said that you might take a cast of old sculpture, such as the Venus de Milo, and different antiques, and reproduce them in plaster, and they would be casts of old sculpture. But whether the figures in question here were casts of sculpture, some of the witnesses were not sure.\n One witness for the government gave as his opinion that the figures in question were casts or specimens because they are sculpture. As to whether they were cast or moulded, he replied that he could not state definitely, but presumably they were casts.\n Another witness for the government was not willing to swear that the figures were not casts of sculpture, while still another said that in his judgment the figures in question were plaster casts in sculpture. He also thought that they might be termed casts of sculpture. Another witness for the government thought they might be called casts of bad sculpture, and that they were such articles as he had heard artists call casts of sculpture.\n This brief review of some of the evidence shows the difference of opinion among the artists themselves as to what would come within their understanding of the definition of the term 'casts of sculpture.' The artists evidently had a contempt for the figures as specimens of art, and very probably that contempt was well founded; but, as we have said, the opinions really give no aid in considering whether the figures are or are not casts of sculpture. The description of the manner in which they are made, as set forth in the foregoing statement of facts, and also the evidence of the witnesses for the government, showing the unity of the method and process with that followed in the case of an admitted cast of sculpture, furnish us better means of determining the question in dispute than may be found in the opinions set forth in the record, and yet some of \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 50]\n\u00a0\n the witnesses do in fact, as we have seen, admit that the figures are casts of sculpture, bad though they may be.\n The government also examined one or two witnesses who were agents or salesmen for manufacturers in this country of what they stated to be substantially the same class of figures as the ones under discussion, and in their catalogues describing the various articles for sale, figures such as these were generally designated as 'statuary,' and when taking orders for such goods they were called 'statuary' or 'composition statues.'\n One of the customs examiners also testified that for the last few years articles of the nature here in question had been returned on invoices to the collector as 'church statuary composed of plaster, decorated, or pulverized cement and plaster.' The witness used the expression 'church statuary composed of' as having been given him by some superior officer, and it was accepted by him as such.\n It will be observed that there is nothing in the tariff act which speaks of 'church statuary' by name. We are not satisfied from this evidence that these figures are not casts of sculpture within the meaning of the statute, nor are we impressed with the statement of some of the witnesses that if, in what is termed their crude state, these figures might or would be described as casts of sculpture, they would cease to be such when painted or decorated. They are still, in substance, the same thing, whether painted or not. How does the mere gilding or painting alter their original character? Some little value has, perhaps, been added to them, but they yet remain what they were before the painting was done. Painting a marble statue does not alter its original substance, or give the subject a new definition or meaning. Some marble statues, the work of a great sculptor, have been slightly painted, under his own direction, for the purpose, as supposed, of imparting a more lifelike appearance to the statue, and of possibly thereby enhancing its value. But the statue remained a statue nevertheless.\n It is so, as we think, in this case. The painting or gilding \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 51]\n\u00a0\n was done to render the figures more fit for the only purpose of their importation,-that is, for use in a religious society. And it was the object, as we believe, of the statute to admit such works free of duty.\n In case No. 5,549, Synopsis of Decisions of the Treasury Department, 1883, p. 41, it was said that the case related to certain images made of earthen substances which, on importation, were subjected to duty at the rate of forty per centum ad valorem, but were claimed in the protest filed to be dutiable at the rate of ten per centum ad valorem, under the provisions for 'statuary' contained in schedule M, Revised Statutes, p. 478,  2504, under heading 'Paintings and Statuary;' the word 'Statuary' being defined as limited 'to include professional productions of a statuary, or of a sculptor only.' It appeared on the trial that the images were made at Munich by persons who professed to have made a study of the art of sculpture for many years, and who acted under the general supervision of an acknowledged sculptor. Several copies were made from one model, and in ordering them the importer designated which he wanted by the number of the article in a catalogue, and the price of the images varied from five to a hundred dollars.\n The circuit court for the southern district of New York held that the articles were entitled to admission as statuary under the provision above mentioned, and the Department acquiesced in the opinion of the court. In that case the Department was of opinion that the works were obviously made by skilful men, and might come in even under the limitation of the word 'statuary' as defined in the act.\n It cannot be and is not claimed that the figures in question here could come in under the term 'statuary,' as that term is defined in the statute of 1897, paragraph 454, which is much more narrow than that of the Revised Statutes. The case shows, however, the tendency of the Department to a liberal construction of the tariff act in this regard.\n On December 22, 1885 (Synopsis of Decisions of the Treasury Department, 1885, p. 513, No. 7,274), the question was sub- \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 52]\n\u00a0\n mitted as to whether figures similar to those under consideration were entitled to free admission under the act of 1883. The Department held that they could not be regarded as 'statuary' because of the limitation of the meaning of the word 'statuary,' as used in that act (22 Stat. at. L. 513, chap. 121), which provided that the word 'statuary' 'should be understood to include professional productions of a statuary or of a sculptor only,' but that they might be admitted as casts of plaster of Paris under paragraph 759 of the free list. Paragraph 771 did not contain the words 'casts of sculpture.'\n In Synopsis of Decisions, Treasury Department, July to December, 1891, vol. 2, p. 1164, there is contained a reply to the naval officer of New York relative to the proper classification of certain figures imported and claimed to be free of duty as statuary or as casts of plaster of Paris, imported for a church under paragraph 677, or as statues, statuary, or specimens of sculpture, under paragraph 692 of the tariff act of 1890. The Acting Secretary referred to the fact that the board of general appraisers had held that the restrictive definition in regard to 'statuary' under paragraph 465 did not apply to such statuary as is specified in the free list. The language of that paragraph (465) the board held limited its definition of the term 'statuary' to that paragraph alone. Continuing, the Secretary said:\n'The Department believes that the crude or inartistic character of the figures under consideration cannot be urged as a reason for their exclusion from the benefits of free entry. It is fair to infer a liberal intention on the part of Congress from the fact of its inclusion of religious institutions among those to which the privilege of free entry is extended. Religious institutions are not schools of art, nor can congregations without adequate means always consult esthetic rules in regard to the equipment of their churches. It is the sentiment of pious associations which gives the figure its effieiency as an aid to religious worship, and the plaster cast may, in this way, be as servicale to the humble worshiper as the more costly work of genius.' \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 53]\n\u00a0\n The subject was again before the Treasury Department on April 26, 1893. (Synopsis of Decisions, Treasury Department, 1893, p. 340.) As appears upon its face, the letter of the Secretary was in reply to a communication from the board of general appraisers, protesting against the free entry of articles of this nature under the act of 1890, because of the advantages thus given to the foreign dealer in these figures, some of whom had a store in Montreal, although the figures were manufactured in Munich, and the order was supplied from the Montreal store, and the board insisted that the figures were not entitled to such entry by the true construction of the statute. The Secretary, in reply, referred to what the board stated to have been the evident intention of Congress in the act that the 'objects exempted from duty should be of such high order as to inspire admiration and devotional feeling,' etc., and held that the views of the board might 'apply to paragraphs 692 and 465, but not to paragraph 677, which provides (with the restriction enumerated in paragraph 465 and implied in paragraph 692) for the exemption from duty of all casts of plaster of Paris imported in good faith for the use of any society or institution incorporated or established for religious purposes.'\n\n It was further stated that 'the Department cannot interpret the provisions of paragraph 677 as establishing in any respect the esthetic standard for such importations, and, without discussing the propriety of such standard, must administer the law according to its apparent intent.' Also: 'Under the last named paragraph (677) it would appear that any plaster cast which should be regarded by a religious society as a desirable acquisition, and shall be classified by the collector as coming within the terms of that paragraph, may be imported free of all duty, without regard to its artistic character.'\n Looking at the various provisions in the tariff statutes, from and including 1861 to and including that of 1897, and taking into consideration the evidence in the record in this case, together with the action of the Treasury Department, as above referred to, the answer to the question of what is the \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 54]\n\u00a0\n true meaning or construction of the words 'casts of sculpture,' as used in the statute of 1897, is not perfectly clear. Some fair reason might, perhaps, be given for a construction which refuses free entry to these figures, but we think that the purpose of Congress was to permit their introduction free of duty as casts of sculpture, when specially imported, in good faith, for the use and by the order of any of the institutions named in the act. The paragraph in question (649) makes it necessary not only that the casts of sculpture should be specially imported, in good faith, for the use of a society, but it must be so imported by the order of such society. Here for the first time it is made necessary that the importation must have been by order of the society, which words are a still further limitation of the conditions upon the existence of which free entry is permitted.\n It may well be that when the act of 1897 was drawn, its framers had in mind the objections above mentioned, made by the board of general appraisers, and therefore further limited the right of free entry to a special importation in good faith for the sue and by order of the society, and to that extent protecting the interests of the 'regular importers who sell from stock,' while at the same time recognizing the policy of permitting a free entry to those societies who, in good faith, ordered the articles for their own special use.\n We are of opinion that the evidence does not justify the assertion that the articles in question were simply known in a commercial sense as 'statuary,' or 'church statuary.' The fact that figures of this nature were designated as statuary in a catalogue of a manufacturer in this country does not clearly or conclusively establish such commercial designation. They were also designated composition statues by the salesman when taking orders for them. If the articles were also known as 'casts of sculpture,' and such language correctly described them, then they would come within the statute, although some manufacturers in this country should, for purposes of a short and easy description, describe them in the catalogues as 'sta- \n\n[192 U.S. 38, 55]\n\u00a0\n tuary,' or 'composition statues.' It seems to us they answer the description of casts of sculpture, and are properly described as such in the act.\n This provision of the statute should be liberally construed in favor of the importer, and if there were any fair doubt as to the true construction of the provision in question, the courts should resolve the doubt in his favor.

W. B. CONKEY CO.(1904)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This case is before us on questions certified by the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. The facts as stated are that on August 24, 1901, the W. B. Conkey Company filed \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 325]\n\u00a0\n its bill of complaint in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Indiana against several parties, praying an injunction, provisional and perpetual, restraining the defendants, their confederates, agents, and servants, from interfering with the operation of its printing and publishing house. A temporary restraining order was issued, and on December 3, 1901, a perpetual injunction was ordered against all the defendants appearing or served with process. On September 13, 1901, the complainant filed its verified petition, informing the court that various persons, among them Edward E. Bessette (who was not named as a party defendant in the bill), with knowledge of the restraining order, had violated it, describing fully the manner of the violation. Upon the filing of that petition Bessette was ordered to appear before the court and show cause why he should not be punished for contempt in violating the restraining order. He appeared and filed his answer to the charges, and upon a hearing the court found him guilty of contempt, and imposed a fine of $250. From this order or judgment Bessette prayed an appeal to the circuit court of appeals, which was allowed, and the record filed in that court. Upon these facts the circuit court of appeals certified the following questions:\n'First. Whether the circuit court of appeals has jurisdiction to review an order or judgment of the circuit court of the United States, finding a person guilty of contempt for violation of an order of that court, and imposing a fine for the contempt.\n\n'Second. Whether the 'Act to Establish Circuit Courts of Appeals, and to Define and Regulate in Certain Cases Jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, and for Other Purposes,' approved March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comn. Stat. 1901, p. 547), authorizes a review by a circuit court of appeals of a judgment or order of a circuit court of the United States, finding a person, not a party to the suit, guilty of contempt for violation of an order of that court, made in such suit, and imposing a fine for such contempt. \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 326]\n\u00a0\n 'Third. Whether, if such review be sanctioned by law, a person so adjudged in contempt, and fined therefor, who is not a party to the suit, can bring the matter to the circuit court of appeals by appeal.\n\n'Fourth. Whether, if such review be sanctioned by law, a person so adjudged in contempt, and fined therefor, who is not a party to the suit, can bring the matter to the circuit court of appeals by writ of error.'\n\n Mr. William Velpeau Rooker for Bessette.\n Messrs. Jacob Newman, Salmon O. Levinson, and Benjamin V. Becker for W. B. Conkey Co.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The primary question is whether the circuit court of appeals can review an order of a district or circuit court in contempt proceedings. A secondary question is, How, if there be a right of review, can it be exercised?\n A contempt proceeding is sui generis. It is criminal in its nature, in that the party is charged with doing something forbidden, and, if found guilty, is punished. Yet it may be resorted to in civil as well as criminal actions, and also independently of any civil or criminal action.\n The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts. It is true Congress, by statute (1 Stat. at L. 83, chap. 20), declared that the courts of the United States 'shall have power . . . to punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same.' And this general power was limited by the act of March 2, 1831 (4 Stat. at L. 487, chap. 99, Rev. Stat.  725, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583), the limitation being--\n'That such power to punish contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence, or so near thereto as to obstruct the \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 327]\n\u00a0\n administration of justice, the misbehavior of any of the officers of said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any such officer, or by any party, juror, witness, or other person, to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts.'\n\n But in respect to this it was held in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510, 22 L. ed. 205, 208:\n'The power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders, and writs of the courts, and, consequently to the due administration of justice. The moment the courts of the United States were called into existence and invested with jurisdiction over any subject, they became possessed of this power. But the power has been limited and defined by the act of Congress of March 2, 1831. The act, in terms, applies to all courts; whether it can be held to limit the authority of the Supreme Court, which derives its existence and powers from the Constitution, may, perhaps, be a matter of doubt. But that it applies to the circuit and district courts there can be no question. These courts were created by acts of Congress. Their powers and duties depend upon the act calling them into existence, or subsequent acts extending or limiting their jurisdiction. The act of 1831 is, therefore, to them the law specifying the cases in which summary punishment for contempts may be inflicted.'\n\n The purpose of contempt proceedings is to uphold the power of the court, and also to secure to suitors therein the rights by it awarded. As said in Re Chiles, 22 Wall. 157, 168, sub nom. Texas v. White, 22 L. ed. 819, 823:\n'The exercise of this power has a two-fold aspect, namely: first, the proper punishment of the guilty party for his disrespect to the court or its order, and second, to compel his performance of some act or duty required of him by the court, which he refuses to perform.'\n\n In Re Nevitt, 54 C. C. A. 622-632, 117 Fed. 448, 458, Judge Sanborn, of the court of appeals for the eighth circuit, \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 328]\n\u00a0\n considered the nature of contempt proceedings at some length. We quote the following from his opinion:\n'Proceedings for contempts are of two classes,-those prosecuted to preserve the power, and vindicate the dignity, of the courts, and to punish for disobedience of their orders, and those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits, and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made to enforce the rights and administer the remedies to which the court has found them to be entitled. The former are criminal and punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. The latter are civil, remedial, and coercive in their nature, and the parties chiefly in interest in their conduct and prosecution are the individuals whose private rights and remedies they were instituted to protect or enforce. Thompson v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 48 N. J. Eq. 105, 108, 21 Atl. 182; Hendryx v. Fitzpatrick, 19 Fed. 810; Ex parte Culliford, 8 Barn. & C. 220; Rex v. Edwards, 9 Barn. & C. 652; People ex rel. Munsell v. Oyer & Terminer Ct. 101 N. Y. 245, 247, 54 Am. Rep. 691, 4 N. E. 259; Phillips v. Welch, 11 Nev. 187, 190; State v. Knight, 3 S. D. 509, 513, 44 Am. St. Rep. 809, 54 N. W. 412; People ex rel. Gaynor v. McKane, 78 Hun, 154, 160, 28 N. Y. Supp. 981; 4 Bl. Com. 285, 7 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 68. A criminal contempt involves no element of personal injury. It is directed against the power and dignity of the court, and private parties have little, if any, interest in the proceedings for its punishment. But if the contempt consists in the refusal of a party or a person to do an act which the court has ordered him to do for the benefit or the advantage of a party to a suit or action pending before it, and he is committed until he complies with the order, the commitment is in the nature of an execution to enforce the judgment of the court, and the party in whose favor that judgment was rendered is the real party in interest in the proceedings.' See also Rapalje, Contempts,  21.\n\n Doubtless the distinction referred to in this quotation is the \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 329]\n\u00a0\n cause of the difference in the rulings of various state courts as to the right of review. Manifestly, if one inside of a court room disturds the order of proceedings, or is guilty of personal misconduct in the presence of the court, such action may properly be regarded as a contempt of court; yet it is not misconduct in which any individual suitor is specially interested. It is more like an ordinary crime which affects the public at large, and the criminal nature of the act is the dominant feature. On the other hand, if, in the progress of a suit, a party is ordered by the court to abstain from some action which is injurious to the rights of the adverse party, and he disobeys that order, he may also be guilty of contempt, but the personal injury to the party in whose favor the court has made the order gives a remedial character to the contempt proceeding. The punishment is to secure to the adverse party the right which the court has awarded to him. He is the one primarily interested, and if it should turn out, on appeal from the final decree in the case, that the original order was erroneous, there would, in most cases, be great propriety in setting aside the punishment which was imposed for disobeying an order to which the adverse party was not entitled.\n It may not be always easy to classify a particular act as belonging to either one of these two classes. It may partake of the characteristics of both. A significant and generally determinative feature is that the act is by one party to a suit in disobedience of a special order made in behalf of the other. Yet sometimes the disobedience may be of such a character and in such a manner as to indicate a contempt of the court rather than a disregard of the rights of the adverse party.\n In the case at bar the controversy between the parties to the suit was settled by final decree, and from that decree, so far as appears, no appeal was taken. An appeal from it would not have brought up the proceeding against the petitioner, for he was not a party to the suit. Yet, being no party to the suit he was found guilty of an act in resistance of the order \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 330]\n\u00a0\n of the court. His case, therefore, comes more fully within the punitive than the remedial class. It should be regarded like misconduct in a court room or disobedience of a subpoena, as among those acts primarily directed against the power of the court, and in that view of the case we pass to a consideration of the questions presented.\n In Re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 39 L. ed. 1092, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900, a case of habeas corpus brought to review an order of the circuit court imprisoning for contempt, we said (p. 596, L. ed. p. 1106, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 911):\n'In brief, a court enforcing obedience to its orders by proceedings for contempt is not executing the criminal laws of the land, but only securing to suitors the rights which it has adjudged them entitled to.'\n\n And again, in summing up our conclusions (p. 599, L. ed. p. 1108, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 912):\n'That the proceeding by injunction is of a civil character, and may be enforced by proceedings in contempt; that such proceedings are not in execution of the criminal laws of the land; that the penalty for a violation of injunction is no substitute for, and no defense to, a prosecution for any criminal offenses committed in the course of such violation.'\n\n At common law it was undoubted that no court reviewed the proceedings of another court in contempt matters. In Crosby's Case, 3 Wils. 188, Mr. Justice Blackstone said:\n'The sole adjudication of contempts, and the punishment thereof, in any manner, belongs exclusively, and without interfering, to each respective court.'\n\n In the case of Ex parte Yates, 4 Johns. 318, 369, Chief Justice Kent, after reviewing the English cases, and referring to the Case of Shaftsbury, 1 Mod. 144, concluded as follows:\n'The court, in that case, seem to have laid down a principle from which they never have departed, and which is essential to the due administration of justice. This principle, that every court, at least of the superior kind, in which great confidence is placed, must be the sole judge, in the last resort, of contempts arising therein, is more explicitly defined and more \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 331]\n\u00a0\n emphatically enforced in the two subsequent cases of Reg. v. Paty [2 Ld. Raym. 1105], and of Brass v. Crosby [3 Wils. 188].'\n\n Without stopping to notice the decisions of the courts of the several states, whose decisions are more or less influenced by the statutes of those states, we turn to an examination of the rulings of this court in respect to the finality of contempt proceedings.\n In Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 5 L. ed. 391, a writ of habeas corpus was issued by this court in behalf of a party committed to jail by the circuit court of the district of Columbia for contempt in refusing to answer a question put to him on a trial. The application for a discharge was refused. The reasons therefor are disclosed by the following quotations from the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Story (p. 42, L. ed. p. 392):\n'It is to be considered that this court has no appellate jurisdiction confided to it in criminal cases, by the laws of the United States. It cannot entertain a writ of error, to revise the judgment of the circuit court, in any case where a party has been convicted of a public offence . . . . If, then, this court cannot directly revise a judgment of the circuit court in a criminal case, what reason is there to suppose that it was intended to vest it with the authority to do it indirectly? . . . If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offense within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, it could hardly be maintained that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside and discharge the prisoner. There is, in principle, no distinction between that case and the present; for when a court commits a party for a contempt, their adjudication is a conviction, and their commitment, in consequence, is execution; and so the law was settled, upon full deliberation, in the case of Brass Crosby, Lord Mayor of London, 3 Wils. 188.'\n\n New Orleans v. New York Mail S. S. Co. 20 Wall. 387, 22 L. ed. 354, was a suit by the company in the circuit court of the United States for an injunction restraining the city from interfering with its \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 332]\n\u00a0\n possession of certain premises. Pending this suit the mayor of the city applied to a state court for an injunction restraining the company from rebuilding an inclosure of the premises which the city had destroyed, and the injunction was granted. At this time the city was the only party defendant in the circuit court, although service upon it had been made by delivering process to the mayor. Subsequently the mayor was made a party defendant by a supplemental bill. A final decree was entered against the defendants, and, as a part thereof, was an order adjudging the mayor guilty of contempt in suing out the injunction in the state court, and imposing a fine therefor. Thereupon the case was brought to this court, and, among other things, the validity of the punishment for contempt was challenged, in respect to which we said (p. 392, L. ed. p. 357):\n'The fine of $300 imposed upon the mayor is beyond our jurisdiction. Contempt of court is a specific criminal offense. The imposition of the fine was a judgment in a criminal case. That part of the decree is as distinct from the residue as if it were a judgment upon an indictment for perjury committed in a deposition read at the hearing. This court can take cognizance of a criminal case only upon a certificate of division in opinion.'\n\n Hayes v. Fischer, \n102 U.S. 121\n, 26 L. ed. 95, was a suit in equity to restrain the use of a patented device. An interlocutory injunction was granted. The defendant was fined for contempt in violating this injunction, and the entire amount of the fine ordered to be paid over to the plaintiff in reimbursement. To reverse this order defendant sued out a writ of error. A motion to dismiss was sustained, Mr. Chief Justice Waite saying for the court (p. 122, L. ed. p. 96):\n'If the order complained of is to be treated as part of what was done in the original suit, it cannot be brought here for review by writ of error. Errors in equity suits can only be corrected in this court on appeal, and that after a final decree. This order, if part of the proceedings in the suit, was interlocutory only. \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 333]\n\u00a0\n 'If the proceeding below, being for contempt, was independent of and separate from, the original suit, it cannot be re-examined here, either by writ of error or appeal. This was decided more than fifty years ago in Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 5 L. ed. 391, and the rule then established was followed as late as New Orleans v. New York Mail S. S. Co. 20 Wall. 387, 22 L. ed. 354). It follows that we have no jurisdiction.'\n\n In Ex parte Fisk, a case of habeas corpus, \n113 \nU.S. 713, 718\n, 28 S. L. ed. 1117, 1119, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724, 726, Mr. Justice Miller speaking for the court declared:\n'There can be no doubt of the proposition that the exercise of the power of punishment for contempt of their orders by courts of general jurisdiction is not subject to review by writ of error or appeal to this court. Nor is there in the system of Federal jurisprudence any relief against such orders, when the court has authority to make them, except through the court making the order, or, possibly, by the exercise of the pardoning power.\n\n'This principle has been uniformly held to be necessary to the protection of the court from insults and oppressions while in the ordinary exercise of its duties, and to enable it to enforce its judgments and orders necessary to the due administration of law and the protection of the rights of suitors.'\n\n In Worden v. Searls, \n121 U.S. 14\n, 30 L. ed. 853, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 814, a final decree was entered in a suit for infringement of a patent, in favor of the plaintiff, and from that decree the defendants appealed. A preliminary injunction had been granted, and prior to the final decree the defendants were adjudged guilty of a contempt in violating it, and ordered to pay to the complainant the sum of $250 as a fine therefor, together with the costs of the contempt proceedings. This court was of opinion that the decree in favor of the plaintiff was erroneous, and reversed it; and in addition to directing a dismissal of the bill, set aside the order imposing the fines in the contempt proceedings, saying in respect thereto ( p. 25, L. ed. p. 857, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 820):\n'We have jurisdiction to review the final decree in the suit and all interlocutory decrees and orders. These fines were \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 334]\n\u00a0\n directed to be paid to the plaintiff. We say nothing as to the lawfulness or propriety of this direction. But the fines were, in fact, measured by the damages the plaintiff had sustained and the expenses he had incurred. They were incidents of his claims in the suit. His right to them was, if it existed at all, founded on his right to the injunction, and that was founded on the validity of his patent.'\n\n But, while setting saide the orders imposing the fines, it was 'without prejudice to the power and right of the circuit court to punish the contempt referred to in those orders by a proper proceeding.'\n Again, in Re Chetwood, an application for prohibition (\n165 \nU.S. 443, 462\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385, 392) is this ruling:\n'Judgments in proceedings in contempt are not reviewable here on appeal or error. Hayes v. Fischer, \n102 U.S. 121\n, 26 L. ed. 95; Re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 573\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1092, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900, \n159 U.S. 251\n, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1039. But they may be reached by certiorari, in the absence of any other adequate remedy. The writ of certiorari will be allowed to bring up the record, so that the order adjudging Chetwood and his counsel in contempt for being concerned in suing out the writs of error, and directing them, or either of them, to refrain from prosecuting the one writ in the name of the bank, and to dismiss the other, may be revised and annulled.'\n\n In O'Neal v. United States, \n190 U.S. 36\n, 47 L. ed. 945, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 776, in which an order of the district court punishing for contempt was brought here on writ of error, we said (p. 38, L. ed. p. 946, Sup. Ct. Rep. 777):\n'While proceedings in contempt may be said to be sui generis, the present judgment is, in effect, a judgment in a criminal case, over which this court has no jurisdiction on error.  5, act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), as amended by the act of Jan. 20, 1897 (29 Stat. at L. 492, chap. 69, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 549, 556); Chetwood Case, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 462\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385; Tinsley v. Anderson, \n171 \nU.S. 101, 105\n, 43 S. L. ed. 91, 96, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 805; Cary Mfg. Co. v. Acme Flexible Clasp Co. \n187 \nU.S. 427, 428\n, 47 S. L. ed. 244, 245, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211.'\n\n In Re Watts, \n190 U.S. 1\n, 47 L. ed. 933, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718, the petitioners having been found guilty of a contempt of court by the district court \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 335]\n\u00a0\n of Indiana, applied for a writ of habeas corpus. We issued with that writ a certiorari, and brought the entire record to this court, and, upon the evidence, discharged the petitioners.\n From these decisions it is apparent that the uniform ruling of this court has been against the right to review the decisions of the lower court in contempt proceedings by writ of error or by appeal, except in cases of purely remedial and interlocutory orders. Yet we have issued certioraries in aid of habeas corpus proceedings and applications for prohibition, by which the facts in the contempt case have been brought before us, and then we have passed upon the merits of the decision in the lower court.\n The thought underlying the denial by this court of the right of review by writ of error or appeal has not been that there was something in contempt proceedings which rendered them not properly open to review, but that they were of a criminal nature, and no provision had been made for a review of criminal cases. This was true in England as here. In that country, as is well known, there was no review of criminal cases by appeal or writ of error. Neither was there in our Federal system prior to the act of February 6, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 656, chap. 113), which provided for a writ of error from this court in capital cases. While the act creating the court of appeals, March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547), authorized a review of criminal cases, yet it limited the jurisdiction of this court to cases of a conviction for a capital or otherwise infamous crime-since limited to capital cases (29 Stat. at L. 492, chap. 68, pp. 549, 556), and gave the right of review of all other criminal cases to the circuit courts of appeal; and, of course, a proceeding in contempt cannot be considered as an infamous crime. Habeas corpus is not treated as a writ of error, and while it may be issued by one court to inquire into the action of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, yet the inquiry is only whether the action of the court in imposing punishment was within its jurisdiction. Even in an appellate court, the writ of habeas corpus is not of itself the equivalent of a writ of error, although, when supplemented by certiorari, as \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 336]\n\u00a0\n shown in the case of Re Watts, \n190 U.S. 1\n, 47 L. ed. 933, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718, it may bring the whole case before the appellate court for review.\n The act of March 3, 1891, establishing circuit courts of appeals must now be more fully considered. While its primary purpose was the relief of this court by the creation of new appellate courts, and the distribution between those courts and this of the entire appellate jurisdiction of the United States (The Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 681\n, 44 S. L. ed. 320, 321, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290, and cases cited), yet it also enlarged the area of appellate jurisdiction. As originally passed it gave to this court jurisdiction over cases of infamous crimes in addition to that which it theretofore had in capital cases. By  6 it gave to the circuit courts of appeals appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or writ of error final decisions in the district court and the existing circuit courts in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section. That this was intended to include criminal cases is evident from a subsequent clause, which makes the decision of the courts of appeals final 'in all cases arising . . . under the criminal laws.' See United States v. Rider, \n163 \nU.S. 132, 138\n, 41 S. L. ed. 101, 103, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983, 986, in which, referring to  5 and 6, we said:\n'Thus, appellate jurisdiction was given in all criminal cases by writ of error, either from this court or from the circuit courts of appeals.'\n\n As, therefore, the ground upon which a review by this court of a final decision in contempt cases was denied no longer exists, the decisions themselves cease to have controlling authority, and whether the circuit courts of appeals have authority to review proceedings in contempt in the district and circuit courts depends upon the question whether such proceedings are criminal cases. That they are criminal in their nature has been constantly affirmed.\n The orders imposing punishment are final. Why, then, should they not be reviewed as final decisions in other criminal cases? It is true they are peculiar in some respects, rightfully styled sui generis. They are triable only by the court against \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 337]\n\u00a0\n whose authority the contempts are charged. No jury passes upon the facts; no other court inquires into the charge. Ex parte Tillinghast, 4 Pet. 108, 7 L. ed. 798. As said by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court, in Eilenbecker v. Plymouth County Dist. Ct. 33 L. ed. 801, 803, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424, 426, \n134 U.S. 31\n, 36:\n'If it has ever been understood that proceedings according to the common law for contempt of court have been subject to the right of trial by jury, we have been unable to find any instance of it. It has always been one of the attributes-one of the powers necessarily incident to a court of justice-that it should have this power of vindicating its dignity, of enforcing its orders, of protecting itself from insult, without the necessity of calling upon a jury to assist it in the exercise of this power.'\n\n See also Re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 39 L. ed. 1092, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900, in which we said (p. 594, L. ed. p. 1106, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 910):\n'But the power of a court to make an order carries with it the equal power to punish for disobedience of that order, and the inquiry as to the question of disobedience has been from time immemorial, the special function of the court. And this is no technical rule. In order that a court may compel obedience to its orders, it must have the right to inquire whether there has been any disobedience thereof. To submit the question of disobedience to another tribunal, be it a jury or another court, would operate to deprive the proceeding of half its efficiency.'\n\n But the mode of trial does not change the nature of the proceeding, or take away the finality of the decision. So when, by  6 of the courts of appeals act, the circuit courts of appeals are given jurisdiction to review the 'final decision in the district court and the existing circuit courts in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law,' and the preceding section gives to this court jurisdiction to review convictions in only capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and no other provision is found in the statutes for a review of the final order in contempt cases, upon what satisfactory ground can \n\n[194 U.S. 324, 338]\n\u00a0\n it be held that the final decisions in contempt cases in the circuit or district courts are not subject to review by the circuit courts of appeals? Considering only such cases of contempt as the present-that is, cases in which the proceedings are against one not a party to the suit, and cannot be regarded as interlocutory-we are of opinion that there is a right of review in the circuit court of appeals. Such review must, according to the settled law of this court, be by writ of error. Walker v. Dreville, 12 Wall. 440, 20 L. ed. 429; Deland v. Platte County, \n155 U.S. 221\n, 39 L. ed. 128, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 82; Bucklin v. United States, \n159 U.S. 680\n, 40 L. ed. 304, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182. On such a writ only matters of law are considered. The decision of the trial tribunal, court or jury, deciding the facts, is conclusive as to them.\n We, therefore, answer the questions in this way: The second and fourth in the affirmative, the third in the negative. It is unnecessary to answer the first. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBINNS v. U S(1904)\nNo. 196\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 486, 487]\n\u00a0\n Section 460 of title II. of the Alaska Penal Code (act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. at L. 1253, 1337, chap. 429), as amended by the act of June 6, 1900, entitled 'An Act Making Further Provision for a Civil Government for Alaska, and for Other Purposes' (31 Stat. at L. 321, 330, chap. 786), reads 'that any person or persons, corporation or company prosecuting or attempting to prosecute any of the following lines of business within the district of Alaska shall first apply for and obtain license so to do from a district court or a subdivision thereof in said district, and pay for said license for the respective lines of business and trade, as follows, to wit: . . . Transfer companies, fifty dollars per annum.'\n Section 461 provides: 'That any person, corporation, or company doing or attempting to do business in violation of the provisions of the foregoing section, or without having first paid the license therein required, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,' etc.\n Section 463: 'That the licenses provided for in this act shall be issued by the clerk of the district court or any subdivision thereof . . . duly made and entered: . . . Provided, That . . . all moneys received for licenses by him . . . under this act shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be covered into the Treasury of the United States, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.'\n Under this statute, plaintiff in error was prosecuted and convicted in the district court for the district of Alaska, second division. This conviction has been brought to this court on writ of error, and the question presented is whether the statute is in conflict with  8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which reads: 'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.' \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. C. Campbell and W. H. Metson for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for defendant in error.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention of plaintiff in error is that the license tax is an excise, that it is laid and collected 'to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,' because, by  463, it is provided that 'all moneys received for licenses . . . under this act shall . . . be covered into the Treasury of the United States;' that it is imposed only in Alaska; and is not 'uniform throughout the United States.'\n It is unnecessary to consider the decisions in the Insular Cases, for, as said by Mr. Justice White in his concurring opinion in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 335\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1088, 1125, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770: 'Without referring in detail to the acquisition from Russia of Alaska, it suffices to say that that treaty also contained provisions for incorporation, and was acted upon;' and by Mr. Justice Gray, in his concurring opinion (p. 345, L. ed. 1128, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 809): 'The cases now before the court do not touch the authority of the United States over the territories, in the strict and technical sense, being those which lie within the United States, as bounded by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Dominion of Canada, and the Republic of Mexico, and the territories of Alaska and Hawaii; but they relate to territory, in the broader sense, acquired by the United States by war with a foreign state.'\n It had been theretofore held by this court in The Coquitlam v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 346, 352\n, 41 S. L. ed. 184, 186, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1117, that 'Alaska is \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n one of the territories of the United States. It was so designated in the order [the order assigning the territory to the ninth judicial circuit], and has always been so regarded. And the court established by the act of 1884 is the court of last resort within the limits of that territory.' Nor can it be doubted that it is an organized territory, for the act of May 17, 1884 (23 Stat. at L. 24, chap. 53), entitled 'An Act Providing a Civil Government for Alaska,' provided: 'That the territory ceded to the United States by Russia by the treaty of March thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and known as Alaska, shall constitute a civil and judicial district, the government of which shall be organized and administered as hereinafter provided.' [15 Stat. at L. 539]. See also 31 Stat. at L. 321, chap. 786,  1.\n We shall assume that the purpose of the license fees required by  460 is the collection of revenue, and that the license fees are excises within the constitutional sense of the term. Nevertheless, we are of opinion that they are to be regarded as local taxes, imposed for the purpose of raising funds to support the administration of local government in Alaska.\n It must be remembered that Congress, in the government of the territories as well as of the District of Columbia, has plenary power, save as controlled by the provisions of the Constitution; that the form of government it shall establish is not prescribed, and may not necessarily be the same in all the territories. We are accustomed to that generally adopted for the territories, of a quasi state government, with executive, legislative, and judicial officers, and a legislature endowed with the power of local taxation and local expenditures; but Congress is not limited to this form. In the District of Columbia it has adopted a different mode of government, and in Alaska still another. It may legislate directly in respect to the local affairs of a territory, or transfer the power of such legislation to a legislature elected by the citizens of the territory. It has provided in the District of Columbia for a board of three commissioners, who are the controlling officers of the District. It may intrust to them a large volume of legislative \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 492]\n\u00a0\n power, or it may, by direct legislation, create the whole body of statutory law applicable thereto. For Alaska, Congress has established a government of a different form. It has provided no legislative body, but only executive and judicial officers. It has enacted a penal and civil code. Having created no legislative body and provided for no local legislation in respect to the matter of revenue, it has established a revenue system of its own, applicable alone to that territory. Instead of raising revenue by direct taxation upon property, it has, as it may rightfully do, provided for that revenue by means of license taxes.\n In reference to the power of Congress, reference may be had to Gibbons v. District of Columbia, \n116 U.S. 404\n, 29 L. ed. 680, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427, in which it was held that 'it is within the constitutional power of Congress, acting as the local legislature of the District of Columbia, to tax different classes of property within the District at different rates;' and further, after referring to the case of Loughborough v. Blake, 5 Wheat. 317, 5 L. ed. 98, it was said (pp. 407, 408, L. ed. p. 681, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 429):\n'The power of Congress, legislating as a local legislature for the District, to levy taxes for District purposes only, in like manner as the legislature of a state may tax the people of a state for state purposes, was expressly admitted, and has never since been doubted. 5 Wheat. 318, 5 L. ed. 98; Welch v. Cook, \n97 U.S. 541\n, 24 L. ed. 1112; Mattingly v. District of Columbia, \n97 U.S. 687\n, 24 L. ed. 1098. In the exercise of this power Congress, like any state legislature unrestricted by constitutional provisions, may, at its discretion, wholly exempt certain classes of property from taxation, or may tax them at a lower rate than other property.'\n\n In view of this decision it would not be open to doubt that, if the act had provided for a local treasurer to whom these local taxes should be paid, and directed that the proceeds be used solely in payment of the necessary expenses of the government of Alaska, its constitutionality would be clear; but the contention is that the statute requires that the proceeds of these licenses shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States, from which, of course, they can only be taken under \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 493]\n\u00a0\n an act of Congress making specific appropriation. In fact, all the expenses of the territory are, in pursuance of statute, paid directly out of the United States Treasury. Act of June 6, 1900, title I.,  2 and 10 ( 31 Stat. at L. 322, 325, chap. 786); act of March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 960, 987, chap. 830, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 41); April 28, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 120, 147, chap. 594); and February 25, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 854, 882, chap. 755). True, there are some special provisions for revenues and their application. Thus, the fees for issuing certificates of admission to the bar, and for commissions to notaries public, are to be retained by the secretary of the district, and 'kept in a fund to be known as the District Historical Library Fund,' and designed for 'establishing and maintaining the district historical library and museum' (act of June 6, 1900, title I.,  32, 31 Stat. at L. 333, chap. 786), and municipal corporations are authorized to impose certain taxes for local purposes. Title III.,  201, 31 Stat. at L. 521, chap. 786. By  203, 50 per cent of all the license moneys collected within the limits of such corporations are to be paid to their treasurers, to be used for school purposes. By subsequent legislation (31 Stat. at L. 1438, chap. 859), it is provided that if the amount thus paid is not all required for school purposes, the district court may authorize the expenditure of the surplus for any municipal purpose. And by the same statute it is also provided that 50 per cent of all license moneys collected outside municipal corporations, and covered into the Treasury of the United States, shall be set aside, to be expended for school purposes outside the municipalities. By still later legislation,-although that was enacted after the commencement of this prosecution (32 Stat. at L. 946, chap. 978),-the entire proceeds of license taxes within the limits of municipal corporations are to be paid to the treasurer of the corporation, for school and municipal purposes.\n But outside of these special matters there are no provisions for collecting revenue within the territory for the expenses of the territorial government other than these license taxes and charges of a similar nature. According to the information furnished by the officers of the Treasury Department, \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 494]\n\u00a0\n as shown in the brief of counsel for the government, all the revenues of every kind and nature which can be considered as coming from Alaska are not equal to the cost and expense of administrating its territorial government. How far we are at liberty to rely upon this information, which was not presented upon the trial of this case, or how far we can take judicial notice of the facts as shown by the records of the Treasury Department, need not be determined, for if an excess of revenue above the cost and expense of administering the territorial government must be shown to establish the unconstitutionality of the license taxes, the fact should have been shown by the plaintiff in error. The presumptions are that the act imposing those taxes is constitutional, and anything essential to establish its invalidity which does not appear of record or from matters of which we can take judicial notice must be shown by the party asserting the unconstitutionality.\n The question may, then, be stated in this form: Congress has undoubtedly the power, by direct legislation, to impose these license taxes upon the residents of Alaska, providing that, when collected, they are paid to a treasurer of the territory, and disbursed by him solely for the needs of the territory. Does the fact that they are ordered to be paid into the Treasury of the United States, and not specifically appropriated to the expenses of the territory, when the sum total of these and all other revenues from the territory does not equal the cost and expense of maintaining its government, make them unconstitutional? In other words, if, under any circumstances, Congress has the power to levy and collect these taxes for the expenses of the territorial government, is it essential to their validity that the proceeds therefrom be kept constantly separate from all other moneys, and specifically and solely appropriated to the interests of the territory? We do not think that the constitutional power of Congress in this respect depends entirely on the mode of its exercise. If it satisfactorily appears that the purpose of these license taxes is to raise revenue for use in Alaska, and that the total revenues \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 495]\n\u00a0\n derived from Alaska are inadequate to the expenses of the territory, so that Congress has to draw upon the general funds of the nation, the taxes must be held valid. That the purpose of these taxes was to raise revenue in Alaska for Alaska is obvious. They were authorized in statutes dealing solely with Alaska. There is no provision for a direct property tax to be collected in Alaska for the general expenses of the territory. The entire moneys collected from these license taxes and otherwise from Alaska are inadequate for the expenses of that territory. So far as we may properly refer to the proceedings in Congress, they affirm that these license taxes are charges upon the citizens of Alaska for the support of its government. While it is generally true that debates in Congress are not appropriate sources of information from which to discover the meaning of the language of a statute passed by that body (United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 \nU.S. 290, 318\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1007, 1019, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540), yet it is also true that we have examined the reports of the committees of either body with a view of determining the scope of statutes passed on the strength of such reports. Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 464\n, 36 S. L. ed. 226, 229, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511. When  461 and 462 were under consideration in the Senate, the chairman of the Committee on Territories, in response to inquiries from Senators, made these replies:\n'The Committee on Territories have thoroughly investigated the condition of affairs in Alaska, and have prepared certain licenses which, in their judgment, will create a revenue sufficient to defray all the expenses of the government of the territory of Alaska. . . . They are licenses peculiar to the condition of affairs in the territory of Alaska on certain lines of goods, articles of commerce, etc., which, in the judgment of the committee, should bear a license, inasmuch as there is no taxation whatever in Alaska. Not one dollar of taxes is raised on any kind of property there. It is therefore necessary to raise revenue of some kind, and in the judgment of the Committee on Territories, after consultation with prominent citizens of the territory of Alaska, including the governor \n\n[194 U.S. 486, 496]\n\u00a0\n and several other officers, this code or list of licenses was prepared by the committee. It was prepared largely upon their suggestions, and upon the information of the committee, derived from conversing with them.' Vol. 32, Congressional Record, Part III, p. 2235\n\n\n\n While, of course, it would have simplified the matter and removed all doubt if the statute had provided that those taxes be paid directly to some local treasurer, and by him disbursed in payment of territorial expenses, yet it seems to us it would be sacrificing substance to form to hold that the method pursued, when the intent of Congress is obvious, is sufficient to invalidate the taxes.\n In order to avoid any misapprehension we may add that this opinion must not be extended to any case, if one should arise, in which it is apparent that Congress is, by some special system of license taxes, seeking to obtain from a territory of the United States revenue for the benefit of the nation, as distinguished from that necessary for the support of the territorial government.\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBIRKETT v. COLUMBIA BANK(1904)\nNo. 26\nArgued: October 28, 1904Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This is an action on a promissory note for $750. The defense is discharge in bankruptcy. The making of the note \n\n[195 U.S. 345, 346]\n\u00a0\n was admitted, and the only question presented is the effect of the discharge.\n The facts as found by the court are: Plaintiff in error and one Calvin Russell, who died before the commencement of this action, were partners, doing business under the name of Russell & Birkett, and in that name made and delivered to the Manhattan Railway Advertising Company a promissory note for $750. The latter company indorsed the note to defendant in error, of which Russell & Birkett had knowledge before its maturity. On the 13th of April 1899, the firm of Russell & Birkett and plaintiff in error, upon their own petition, were adjudicated bankrupts in the United States district court for the northern districe of New York, and were discharged September 12, 1899. The claim of defendant in error was not scheduled, either as a debt of the firm or of plaintiff in error, in time for proof and allowance with the name of the defendant in error, though defendant in error was known, at the time of filing the schedules, to be the owner and holder thereof by plaintiff in error, and that defendant in error had no notice or actual knowledge or other knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy prior to the discharge of the bankrupts. No notice of the proceedings in bankruptcy was at any time given to defendant in error by, or by the direction of, the bankrupts or either of them. It was decided that the claim of defendant in error was not barred by the discharge in bankruptcy, and judgment was directed for defendant in error.\n Messrs. John Murray Downs, Robert G.

Frank for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The judgment was successively confirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court and the court of appeals. 174 N. Y. 112, 66 N. E. 652. Thereupon judgment was entered in the supreme court, in accordance with the direction of the court of appeals. This writ of error was then sued out.\n Section 7 of the bankrupt law of 1898 devolves a number of duties upon the bankrupt, all directed to the purpose of a full and unreserved exposition of his affairs, property, and creditors. Among his duties he is required to 'prepare, make oath to, and file in court, within ten days . . . a schedule of his property showing the amount and kind of property, the location thereof, its money value in detail, and a list of his creditors, showing their residences, if known; if unknown, that fact to be stated, the amounts due each of them, the consideration thereof, the security held by them, if any, and a claim for such exemptions as he may be entitled to, all in triplicate, one copy of each for the clerk, one for the referee, and one for the trustee. . . .' To the neglect of this duty the law attaches a punitive consequence. Section 17 provides: 'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such . . . have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and allowance, with the name of the creditor, if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy . . .' [30 Stat. at L. 578, 550, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3424, 3428.]\n But plaintiff in error urges that defendant in error did have actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and that Congress contemplated that there might be an intentional or inadvertent omission of the names of creditors from the schedule of debts, and provided against it by other provisions of the \n\n[195 U.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n law; especially by that which makes it the duty of the referee to give notice to creditors ( 38), and by that which imposes the duty on the bankrupt to appear at the meeting of creditors, for examination.\n The finding of the trial court is that defendant 'had no notice or actual knowledge, or other knowledge, of said proceedings in bankruptcy prior to the discharge of the bankrupt therein.' This is made more definite as to time by the court of appeals. Defendant in error, upon making an inquiry by letter November 6, 1899, about Russell & Birkett, was informed that they had gone through bankruptcy; and subsequently (November 17) the northern district was given as the district of the proceedings. The discharge was September 12, 1899. Knowledge, therefore, it is contended, came to defendant in error in time to prove its claim ( 65), and to move to revoke the discharge of the bankrupt ( 15). It is hence argued that defendant in error must be held to have had 'actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy,' as those words of  17 must be construed. We do not think so, nor is that construction supported by the other provisions of the law urged by plaintiff in error. Actual knowledge of the proceedings, contemplated by the section, is a knowledge in time to avail a creditor of the benefits of the law,-in time to give him an equal opportunity with other creditors,-not a knowledge that may come so late as to deprive him of participation in the administration of the affairs of the estate, or to deprive him of dividends ( 65). The provisions of the law relied upon by plaintiff in error are for the benefit of creditors, not of the debtor. That the law should give a creditor remedies against the estate of a bankrupt, notwithstanding the neglect or default of the bankrupt, is natural. The law would be, indeed, defective without them. It would also be defective if it permitted the bankrupt to experiment with it,- to so manage and use its provisions as to conceal his estate, deceive or keep his creditors in ignorance of his proceeding, without penalty to him. It is easy to see \n\n[195 U.S. 345, 351]\n\u00a0\n what results such looseness would permit,-what preference could be accomplished and covered by it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

Carusi, Charles H. Merillat, and Eugene Carusi & Sons for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D McKenney and John Spalding Flannery for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action brought in the supreme court of the District of Columbia to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by Mrs. Boering while riding in one of the coaches of the defendant, and caused, as alleged, by the negligence of the company. Her husband was joined with her as plaintiff, but no personal injury to him was alleged. The defense was that she was riding upon a free pass, which contained the following stipulation: 'The person accepting and using this pass thereby assumes all risk of accident and damage to person and property, whether caused by negligence of the company's agents or otherwise.' A trial before the court and a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendant, which was affirmed by the court of appeals of the district (20 App. D. C. 500), and thereupon the case was brought here on error.\n The contention of the plaintiffs is that the company was liable in any event for injuries caused by its negligence to one \n\n[193 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n riding on its trains; and further, that if it were not liable for such negligence to one accepting a free pass containing the stipulation quoted, it was liable to Mrs. Boering, because it did not appear that she knew or assented to the stipulation. The trial court submitted to the jury the question whether she was, in fact, a free passenger, and as the verdict was in favor of the defendant, that question of fact was settled in favor of the company. Under those circumstances the recent decision of this court in Northern P. R. Co. v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 440\n, ante, p. 408, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 408, disposes of the first contention.\n With reference to the second contention, the testimony of the two plaintiffs showed that the husband had attended to securing transportation; that he obtained passes for himself and wife, and that they had traveled on these passes before; that she knew the difference between passes (she called them 'cards') and tickets, for on that day her husband had purchased a ticket for a friend who was traveling with them, and she had seen him use both ticket and passes. They further testified that she had not had either pass in her possession, and that her attention had not been called to the stipulation. Now, it is insisted that the exemption from liability for negligence results only from a contract therefor; that there can be no contract without knowledge of the terms thereof and assent thereto, and that she had neither knowledge of the stipulation nor assented to its terms; that therefore there was no contract between her and the company exempting it from liability for negligence. Counsel refer to several cases in which it has been held that stipulations in contracts for carriage of persons or things are not binding unless notice of those stipulations is brought home to such passenger or shipper. We do not propose in any manner to qualify or limit the decisions of this court in respect to those matters. They are not pertinent to this case. They apply when a contract for carriage and shipment is shown. When that appears it is fitting that any claim of limitation of the ordinary liabilities arising from such a contract should not be recognized unless both parties to the \n\n[193 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n contract assent, and that assent is not to be presumed, but must be proved. Here there was no contract of carriage, and that fact was known to Mrs. Boering. She was simply given permission to ride in the coaches of the defendant. Accepting this privilege, she was bound to know the conditions thereof. She may not, through the intermediary of an agent, obtain a privilege-a mere license-and then plead that she did not know upon what conditions it was granted. A carrier is not bound, any more than any other owner of property, who grants a privilege, to hunt the party to whom the privilege is given, and see that all the conditions attached to it are made known. The duty rests rather upon the one receiving the privilege to ascertain those conditions. In Quimby v. Boston & M. R. Co. 150 Mass. 365, 5 L. R. A. 846, 23 N. E. 205, a case of one traveling on a free pass, and in which the question of the assent of the holder of the pass was presented, the court said (p. 367, L. R. A. p. 847, N. E. p. 205):\n'Having accepted the pass, he must have done so on the conditions fully expressed therein, whether he actually read them or not. Squire v. New York C. R. Co. 98 Mass. 239, 93 Am. Dec. 162; Hill v. Boston, H. T. & W. R. Co. 144 Mass. 284, 10 N. E. 836; Boston & M. R. Co. v. Chipman, 146 Mass. 107, 14 N. E. 940.'\n\n So in Muldoon v. Seattle City R. Co. 10 Wash. 311, 313, 38 Pac. 995, 996:\n'We think it may be fairly held that a preson receiving a ticket for free transportation is bound to see and know all of the conditions printed thereon which the carrier sees fit to lawfully impose. This is an entirely different case from that where a carrier attempts to impose conditions upon a passenger for hire, which must, if unusual, be brought to his notice. In these cases of free passage, the carrier has a right to impose any conditions it sees fit as to time, trains, baggage, connections, and, as we have held, damages for negligence; and the recipient of such favors ought, at least, to take the trouble to look on both sides of the paper before he attempts to use them.'\n\n See also Griswold v. New York & N. E. R. Co. 53 \n\n[193 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n Conn. 371, 55 Am. Rep. 115, 4 Atl. 261; Illinois C. R. Co. v. Read, 37 Ill. 484, 510, 87 Am. Dec. 260. As was well observed by Circuit Judge Putnam in Duncan v. Maine C. R. Co. 113 Fed. 508, 514, in words quoted with approval by the court of appeals in this case:\n'The result we have reached conforms the law applicable to the present issue to that moral sense which justly holds those who accept gratuities and acts of hospitality to perform the conditions on which they are granted.'\n\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADFORD v. SOUTHERN R CO(1904)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n This case is brought here on the following certificate:\n'This was an action of tort. The plaintiff was a citizen of Tennessee, and the defendant a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia. The jurisdiction of the court below was wholly dependent upon diversity of citizenship. There was a jury and verdict against the plaintiff in error and a judgment accordingly.\n\n'The plaintiff in error sued out this writ of error, and has lodged with the clerk of this court, within the time required by law, a full transcript of the record in the court below. The \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n clerk refusing to docket same unless the plaintiff would deposit with him the sum of $35, as security for taxable costs, as required by rule 16 of this court, the plaintiff has filed her petition, duly verified, praying to be allowed to prosecute her writ in forma pauperis, and that the clerk be required to docket said transcript, and that the rule requiring a deposit to cover costs be dispensed with. The petition shows a state of facts which entitle the plaintiff to prosecute her writ of error as a poor person, provided the act of July 20, 1892, 27 Stat. at L. 252, chap. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 706, applies to appellate proceedings.\n\n'Because this court has doubts as to whether the act of Congress above mentioned applies to appellate proceedings, it is ordered that the foregoing statement be certified to the Supreme Court, and the instruction of that court be requested for the proper decision of the following questions which arise upon the petition and motion of the plaintiff in error:\n\n'1. Does the act of July 20, 1892 (27 Stat. at L. 252, chap. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 706), providing when a plaintiff may sue as a poor person, apply to the prosecution of a writ of error from this court?\n\n'2. If that act of Congress does not apply to appellate proceedings, has this court any authority to permit the prosecution of a writ of error in forma pauperis?'\n\n The act of July 20, 1892, above referred to, reads:\n'An Act Providing When Plaintiff May Sue as a Poor Person and When Counsel Shall Be Assigned by the Court.\n\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That any citizen of the United States, entitled to commence any suit or action in any court of the United States, may commence and prosecute to conclusion any such suit or action without being required to prepay fees or costs, or give security therefor before or after bringing suit or action, upon filing in said court a statement under oath, in writing, that, because of his poverty, he is unable to pay the costs of said suit or action which he is about to commence, or to give security for the same, and that he believes he is entitled to the redress he seeks \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n by such suit or action, and setting forth briefly the nature of his alleged cause of action.\n\n'Sec. 2. That after any such suit or action shall have been brought, or that is now pending, the plaintiff may answer and avoid a demand for fees or security for costs by filing a like affidavit, and wilful false swearing in any affidavit provided for in this or the previous section shall be punishable as perjury is in other cases.\n\n'Sec. 3. That the officers of the court shall issue, serve all process, and perform all duties in such cases, and witnesses shall attend as in other cases, and the plaintiff shall have the same remedies as are provided by law in other cases.\n\n'Sec. 4. That the court may request any attorney of the court to represent such poor person, if it deems the cause worthy of a trial, and may dismiss any such cause so brought under this act if it be made to appear that the allegation of poverty is untrue, or if said court be satisfied that the alleged cause of action is frivolous or malicious.\n\n'Sec. 5. That judgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit, as in other cases: Provided, That the United States shall not be liable for any of the costs thus incurred.'\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n After the passage of the act of July 20, 1892, many applications were made to this court for leave to prosecute writs of error or appeals in forma pauperis, and were uniformly denied, as we were of opinion that the act had no relation to proceedings in this court. And we so stated in Gallaway v. State Nat. Bank, 186, U. S. 177, 46 L. ed. 1111, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811, where leave was asked to prosecute a writ of error to a state court without giving security as required by  1000 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 712). The ruling would have been the same if the review of the judgment or decree of a court of the United States had been sought; because, in our view, the statute refers only to the court of original jurisdiction. And the same ruling must necessarily obtain in the circuit courts of appeals.\n The act consists of five sections. Of these,  3 and 4 obviously relate to the Trial or hearing. By  5 'judgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit, as in other cases,' which we take to mean judgment at the close of the trial or hearing, and not judgment then and also judgment in appellate proceedings, or, in case of such proceedings, no judgment for costs below until judgment rendered above.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney and James Gallagher for Bradford. \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank P. Poston and W. A. Henderson for Southern Railway Company.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n The first section relates to the commencement and carrying forward of a suit or action without plaintiff being required to prepay fees or costs or to give security therefor, whether the fees or costs accrue at the beginning or during the progress of the suit or action. The application is to be made at the outset, and the order, if granted, covers the fees or costs accruing when or after the suit or action is commenced. And this result is secured by the words 'and its prosecution to conclusion.' That conclusion is the termination of the suit or action in the court where it is commenced. The second section provides for a similar application after the suit or action has been brought.\n The words 'suit or action' are used in both sections, and the applicant is required to set forth 'his alleged cause of action,' and by  4 the case may be dismissed 'if it be made to appear that the allegation of poverty is untrue, or if said court be satisfied that the alleged cause of action is frivolous or malicious.'\n Lord Coke defined 'action' to be 'a legal demand of one's right,' and cause of action comprises every fact a plaintiff is obliged to prove in order to obtain judgment; or, conversely, every fact the defendant would have the right to traverse (Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Dixon, \n179 \nU.S. 131, 139\n, 45 S. L. ed. 121, 125, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67). The words 'action' and 'cause of action' are not ordinarily applicable to writs of error, and, in our opinion, were obviously not so applicable here, but used diverso intuitu. And this is so whether a writ of error be considered a new proceeding or a continuation of the original proceeding, as it is usually regarded in the Federal courts. Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 410, 5 L. ed. 292; Nations v. Johnson, 24 How. 205, 16 L. ed. 632; Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 461\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385.\n A leading case on the subject is Moore v. Cooley, 2 Hill, 412. The statute of New York under consideration in that case was as follows (2 Rev. Stat. N. Y. 2d ed. 1836, p. 362):\n'Every poor person, not being of ability to sue, who shall have a cause of action against any other, may petition the \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n court in which such action is depending, or in which it is intended to be brought, for leave to prosecute as a poor person, and to have counsel and attorneys assigned to conduct his suit.'\n\n After quoting the statute Judge Cowen said:\n'Strictly speaking, an error on which a writ lies is not a cause of action; for, as Lord Coke says, there is a distinction between writs and actions; and under this distinction he instances actions and writs of error. 2 Inst. 39, 40. And yet, a release of all actions extends to writs of error, when anything may be recovered or taken by way of restitution under or in consequence of the writ of error. Co. Litt. 288, b; Bacon, Abr. Release, I. 2. This, however, I take it, proceeds rather upon an equitable, and therefore extended, construction of the words in the release, beyond their strict meaning; for they generally reach the original matter out of which the error arose, that being the direct subject of an action if the matter be thrown open by the writ of error. The original matter being released, therefore, the words are very properly construed as reaching indirectly and in liberal construction to the writ of error itself, because that depends upon the original matter. Yet, in strictness, no book holds the word 'action,' or words 'cause of action,' to be identical with a writ of error or cause of a writ of error.\n\n'There can be little doubt that the statute under which this motion is made should be construed strictly; for the pauper comes to litigate entirely at the expense of others. He is neither to pay his own attorneys or counsel, nor is he liable to his adversary should the suit prove to be groundless. He thus enjoys a great privilege and exemption from the common lot of men, whereby, in respect to causes of action proper, he becomes, as Lord Bacon says, rather able to vex than unable to sue. Hist. of Hen. VII.'\n\n Lord Bacon was referring to the statute 11 Hen. VII., chap. 12, and his language is elsewhere translated or explained to mean 'that the charity of the legislature thought it better that the \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n poor man should be able to vex than that he should not be able to sue.' 6 Bacon's Works, 161.\n So in Bristol v. United States, 129 Fed. 87, 63 C. C. A. 529, where the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that the act of Congress of July 20, 1892, did not entitle a defendant in a criminal case to prosecute a writ of error out of the circuit court of appeals in forma pauperis, Jenkins, J., delivering the opinion, said:\n'We do not think it can properly be said that a writ of error is a suit or action within the statute so far as respects a writ of error in a criminal case. Were it not for the words 'prosecute to conclusion,' we doubt if any court would hold that the act applied to an appeal or writ of error in a civil cause. The applicant, by the statute, must declare the nature of his cause of action. Surely an erroneous ruling by the trial court cannot be held to furnish a 'cause of action,' as that phrase is commonly understood. The statute, by that term, in our judgment, refers to a legal demand by one against another, not to the rulings of a trial court. Under a somewhat similar statute of the state of New York, its supreme court, speaking through Judge Cowen, held that the provisions of the statute do not extend to writs of error. Moore v. Cooley, 2 Hill, 412.'\n\n We adhere to the view that the act, on its face, does not apply to appellate proceedings, and that it does not is sustained by other considerations.\n The act of July 20, 1892, does not purport to grant the right to prosecute a writ of error or an appeal, and that right depends on a statute, and not on the common law. United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 171, 2 L. ed. 401. Errors can be reviewed only in the cases in which those processes are given by statute. Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 21\n, 23 L. ed. 788.\n Section 11 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, creating the circuit court of appeals, provides:\n'And all provisions of law now in force regulating the methods and system of review, through appeals or writs of \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n error, shall regulate the methods and system of appeals and writs of error provided for in this act in respect of the circuit courts of appeals, including all provisions for bonds or other securities to be required and taken on such appeals and writs of error, and any judge of the circuit courts of appeals, in respect of cases brought or to be brought to that court, shall have the same powers and duties as to the allowance of appeals or writs of error, and the conditions of such allowance, as now by law belong to the justices or judges in respect of the existing courts of the United States respectively.' [26 Stat. at L. 829, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 552.]\n\n There are several such provisions, and, among others,  1000 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 712) reads:\n'Every justice or judge signing a citation on any writ of error shall, except in cases brought up by the United States, or by direction of any department of the government, take good and sufficient security that the plaintiff in error or the appellant shall prosecute his writ or appeal to effect; and, if he fails to make his plea good, shall answer all damages and costs, where the writ is a supersedeas and stays execution, or all costs only where it is not a supersedeas as aforesaid.'\n\n Clearly, an act giving the right to prosecute in forma pauperis cannot be extended by implication beyond its terms, in conflict with existing provisions in relation to writs of error and appeals.\n The result is that the first question must be answered in the negative.\n\n 2. \nThe second question is whether, if the act of July 20, 1892, does not apply to appellate proceedings, the court of appeals has 'any authority to permit the prosecution of a writ of error in forma pauperis.'\n We answer that that court has no such power nless derived from statute, and we find no tatute authorizing any order to that effect.\n Costs re the creatures of statute, and it is settle that authority to permit prosecution in forma pauperis must be given by statute. \n\n[195 U.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n By  2 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, the costs and fees in the Supreme Court are made the costs and fees in the circuit courts of appeals, and the latter courts are empowered to establish all rules and regulations for the conduct of the business of the court.\n And it appears that on November 21, 1898, rule 16 of the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit was so amended as to read that, 'at the time of filing the record, the plaintiff in error or appellant shall deposit with the clerk the sum of $35 as security for costs, except in cases in which the proper showing is made, and an order of this court is entered thereon, allowing the cause to proceed in forma pauperis.'\n But the exception must be assumed to have been framed on a construction of the act of July 20, 1892, which we have been constrained to hold it does not bear, and the exception falls in the absence of a statute authorizing such an order.\n We need not advert to the distinction between costs and fees, but it should be noted that the power of the circuit courts of appeals, in respect of the distribution of costs, or in dealing with its officers in respect of their fees, under special circumstances, is not here involved.\n Both questions answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP(1904)\nNo. 243\nArgued: April 21, 1904Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. John S. Miller, Merritt Starr, and W. W. Hammond for plaintiff in error. \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Five ejectment suits were brought by Lightcap against tenants of Mrs. Bradley, July 13, 1895, in the circuit court of Mason county, Illinois, and taken on change of venue to Fulton county, where they were consolidated; Mrs. Bradley was let in to defend, and the case went to judgment in her favor. This judgment was reversed by the supreme court of Illinois, after several hearings, and the case remanded to the circuit court. 186 Ill. 510, 58 N. E. 221. On the retrial, judgment was recovered by Lightcap, which was affirmed by the supreme court (201 Ill. 511, 66 N. E. 546), and this writ of error prosecuted.\n On the disposition of the case when brought to the supreme court the second time the division of opinion among the seven members of the court found expression. Mr. Chief Justice Magruder, Mr. Justice Carter, and Mr. Justice Ricks concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cartwright in affirmance of the judgment. Mr. Justice Wilkin and Mr. Justice Boggs filed dissents, and Mr. Justice Hand, while agreeing that the legal title was in Lightcap, was of opinion that the full beneficial interest was in Mrs. Bradley, and that she, being in possession, a court of chancery might protect her equitable interest and possession by enjoining the prosecution of the ejectment suit.\n The facts are in substance these:\n Tobias S. Bradley loaned T. B. Breedlove, June 3, 1867, $19,616, evidenced by notes payable in one, two, three, four, and five years, respectively, and secured by a trust deed on 1,200 acres of land in Mason county, Illinois. On Bradley's death, Lydia, his widow, became the sole owner of the trust deed and notes. October 8, 1867, Breedlove conveyed the 1,200 acres to Prettyman, subject to the mortgage to Bradley. August 13, 1868, Prettyman conveyed 680 acres to McCune, and McCune gave a trust deed thereon to E. G. Johnson, trustee, to secure the payment of $15,000, evidenced by three notes, to the order of Lydia Bradley, and due in one, two, and three years after date. Mrs. Bradley, through her agent, accepted these notes and trust deed as part payment of the \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Breedlove notes, and Prettyman paid the difference, and the 1,200 acres were released from the Breedlove trust deed or mortgage.\n November 13, 1868, McCune conveyed the 680 acres to Prettyman, subject to the trust deed to Johnson. No taxes were paid by McCune or by Prettyman, and no part of the mortgage debt was ever paid.\n May 24, 1871, Mrs. Bradley redeemed from the tax sales for taxes of 1868 and 1869, and in 1872 for the taxes of 1871, and she has paid all other taxes assessed on the land since the trust deed or mortgage was given.\n Early in the summer of 1871, Austin Johnson, whom Mrs. Bradley, in July, 1870, had appointed her business agent, went on the land on her behalf, and, in 1872, Mrs. Bradley and Austin Johnson together went upon the land, and she took personal and exclusive possession of it, which, by herself and her tenants, she has retained ever since.\n February 22, 1872, Mrs. Bradley filed a bill in the circuit court of Mason county to set aside the release of the Breedlove trust deed or mortgage, on the ground of fraud, and for the foreclosure of that mortgage on the 1,200 acres for the payment of the balance of the original debt. McCune was a party, but seems to have left the state, and was brought in by publication. The bill was contested, and on August 22, 1879, the Mason circuit court entered a decree of foreclosure and sale on the McCune trust deed, finding the amount due Mrs. Bradley to be $31,500. The 680 acres were sold by the master in chancery, October 27, 1879, bid in for Mrs. Bradley for $10,000, and a certificate was issued to her.\n Mrs. Bradley proceeded to develop and improve the 680 acres, drained the tract, erected farm buildings, laid tiles, reduced the land to cultivation, and has maintained exclusive possession to this date.\n September 4, 1893, Prettyman gave a quitclaim deed of the land to Lightcap, which was recorded November 30, 1894. July 13, 1895, these actions in ejectment were commenced. \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n The McCune trust deed or mortgage was executed August 13, 1868, and at that time chapter 57 of the Revised Statutes of Illinois contained these sections:\n'Sec. 12. Whenever any lands or tenements shall be sold by virtue of any execution, it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer, instead of executing a deed for the premises sold, to give to the purchaser or purchasers of such land or tenements a certificate in writing, describing the lands or tenements purchased, and the sum paid therefor, or, if purchased by the plaintiff in the execution, the amount of his bid, and the time when the purchaser will be entitled to a deed for such lands or tenements, unless the same shall be redeemed, as is provided in this chapter, and such sheriff or other officer shall, within ten days from such sale, file in the office of the recorder of the county, a duplicate of such certificate, signed by him; and such certificate, or a certified copy thereof, shall be taken and deemed evidence of the facts therein contained.\n\n'Sec. 13. It shall be lawful for any defendant, his heirs, executors, administrators, or grantees, whose lands or tenements shall be sold by virtue of any execution, within twelve months from such sale, to redeem such lands or tenements, by paying to the purchaser thereof, his executors, administrators, or assigns, or to the sheriff or other officer who sold the same, for the benefit of such purchaser, the sum of money which may have been paid on the purchase thereof, or the amount given or bid, if purchased by the plaintiff in the execution, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per centum from the time of such sale, and on such sum being made as aforesaid, the said sale and the certificate thereupon granted shall be null and void.'\n\n'Sec. 22. If such lands or tenements so sold shall not be redeemed as aforesaid, either by the defendant or by such creditor as aforesaid, within fifteen months from the time of such sale, it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer, who sold the same, or his successor in office, or his executors \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n or administrators, to complete such sale, by executing a deed to the purchaser; . . .'\n\n'Sec. 24. In all cases hereafter, where lands shall be sold under and by virtue of any decree of a court of equity, for the sale of mortgaged lands, it shall be lawful for the mortgagor of such lands, his heirs, executors, administrators, or grantees to redeem the same in the manner prescribed in this chapter for the redemption of lands sold by virtue of executions issued upon judgments at common law, and judgment creditors may redeem lands sold under any such decree in the same manner as is prescribed for the redemption of lands in like manner sold upon executions issued upon judgments at common law.'\n\n The statutes contained no limitation of time within which a sheriff's or master's deed must be taken after the period for redemption had expired, and prescribed no penalty or loss of right to the purchaser by reason of delay or failure in taking out such deed.\n In Rucker v. Dooley, 49 Ill. 377, 95 Am. Dec. 614, the supreme court of Illinois, at its September term, 1868, reasoning by analogy, held in an equity suit, as against a purchaser of real estate at an execution sale, who was never in its possession, and had no claim to it, except under his judgment and sale, and who had taken out a sheriff's deed twenty-nine years after the sale, and in favor of a bona fide purchaser, in possession, claiming by mesne conveyances from the judgment debtor, that, for the protection of purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice, from the judgment debtor and those claiming under him, a sheriff's deed ought not to be issued after the lapse of twenty years, and that application for a deed made after the lapse of seven years, during which the judgment was a lien, and fifteen months, the time given for redemption, and within twenty years, should be made to the proper court by rule on the sheriff and notice to the parties interested.\n March 22, 1872, an act of the general assembly of Illinois was approved, entitled, 'An Act in Regard to Judgments and Decrees, and the Manner of Enforcing the Same by Execution, \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n and to Provide for the Redemption of Real Estate Sold Under Execution or Decree,' which went into force July 1, 1872, the provisions of which were not materially different from those above quoted, but  30 was as follows, the additions to former acts being indicated by italics:\n' 30. When the premises mentioned in any such certificate shall not be redeemed in pursuance of law, the legal holder of such certificate shall be entitled to a deed therefor at any time within five years from the expiration of the time of redemption. The deed shall be executed by the sheriff, master in chancery, or other officer who made such sale, or by his successor in office, or by some person specially appointed by the court for the purpose. If the time of redemption shall have elapsed before the taking effect of this act, a deed may be given within two years from the time this act shall take effect. When such deed is not taken within the time limited by this act, the certificate of purchase shall be null and void; but if such deed is wrongfully withheld by the officer whose duty it is to execute the same, or if the execution of such deed is restrained by injunction or under of a court or judge, the time during which the deed is so withheld or the execution thereof restrained shall not be taken as any part of the five years within which said holder shall take a deed.'\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. A. Wallace, George W. Wall, and Lyman Lacey, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court.\n Among the defenses it is stated Mrs. Bradley relied on were that 'under  6 of chapter 83 of the Revised Statutes, in regard to limitations, the trust deed from McCune to Johnson, the decree of sale, and certificate of purchase constituted color of title which, coupled with her possession and payment of taxes for seven successive years, made her the legal owner of the lands to the extent and according to the purport of her paper title;' that 'under  4 of the same act her possession and actual residence, through her tenants, for seven successive years, having a connected title in law or equity deducible of record from the United States, by virtue of the same trust deed, decree and sale, barred the action of plaintiff;' and 'that she was mortgagee in possession after condition broken, and entitled to possession as such.' The supreme court of Illinois overruled all these defenses, and held \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n that when the sale was made under the decree, and the mortgagee purchased at the sale, the mortgage was satisfied as to the land, and all rights of the mortgagee were represented by the certificate of purchase; and that, by force of the act of 1872, the mortgagee having failed to take the deed within the time limited by the statute, the certificate became null and void, her title terminated as it would on redemption, and she ceased to have any interest whatever in the premises, so that the mortgagor or his grantees, without any payment of the mortgage debt, was entitled to recover the possession from the mortgagee, in ejectment, on the strength of a perfect title.\n Before and when the trust deed to Johnson, which may be treated as if a mortgage to Mrs. Bradley, was given, the legal title passed to the mortgagee according to the law of Illinois in respect of mortgages.\n After condition broken the mortgagee became entitled to possession of the mortgaged premises, and could maintain an action of ejectment. The mortgagor had only an equity of redemption, and, in case of sale on foreclosure, had, by statute, the right to redeem within twelve months by making full payment.\n The law in general as it is today was thus declared in Ware v. Schintz, 190 Ill. 189, 193, 60 N. E. 67, 69:\n'Under the repeated rulings of this court a mortgagee, as against the mortgagor, is held, as in England, in law, to be the owner of the fee, having the jus in re as well as ad rem, and entitled to all the rights and remedies which the law gives to such owner, and may, after condition broken, maintain ejectment against the mortgagor. The mortgagor or his assignee, however, is the legal owner of the mortgaged estate as against all persons, excepting the mortgagee or his assignees. Delahay v. Clement, 4 Ill. 201; Vansant v. Allmon, 23 Ill. 30; Carroll v. Ballance, 26 Ill. 9, 79 Am. Dec. 354; Oldham v. Pfleger, 84 Ill. 102; Fountain v. Bookstaver, 141 Ill. 461, 31 N. E. 17; Esker v. Hefferman, 159 Ill. 38, 41 N. E. 1113. The fee title held by the mortgagee is in the nature of a base or determinable fee. The term of its \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n existence is measured by that of the mortgage debt. When the latter is paid or becomes barred by the statute of limitations the mortgagee's title is extinguished by operation of law. Pollock v. Maison, 41 Ill. 516; Harris v. Mills, 28 Ill. 44, 81 Am. Dec. 259; Gibson v. Rees, 50 Ill. 383; Barrett v. Hinckley, 124 Ill. 32, 7 Am. St. Rep. 331, 14 N. E. 863; Lightcap v. Bradley, 186 Ill. 510, 58 N. E. 221. Until it is extinguished the legal title is in the mortgagee for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction of his debt.'\n\n The condition of the McCune mortgage was broken as soon as made by failure to pay taxes previously and then due, and again by failure to pay the notes maturing in 1869, 1870, and 1871, and Mrs. Bradley entered into peaceable possession of the tract of 680 acres before the act of 1872 took effect. If the assent of the mortgagor was necessary, which we do not hold it was, it should be implied in the circumstances. Her possession was that of mortgagee in possession, and she could defend, as against the owner of the equity of redemption, any action except for an accounting of the rents and profits, and to redeem. And, as she could pursue concurrent remedies, the character of her possession was not affected by the filing and pendency of the bill to set aside the release of the Breedlove mortgage. But that bill went to decree in 1879 of foreclosure of the McCune mortgage by sale, and sale was had. There was no independent purchaser, nor was the whole amount of the mortgage debt bid, but Mrs. Bradley, the mortgagee in possession, bid about one third of the amount due. By the statute the right of redemption of McCune and his grantee was barred and determined October 27, 1880, at the expiration of twelve months from the date of sale, and so it was by the express provision of the decree of foreclosure.\n The certificate of purchase was issued to Mrs. Bradley, but it does not appear that she obtained a deed. It is assumed, and we assume, that she did not, although it is suggested that after the lapse of so many years, and under the circumstances, in an action at law by the original mortgagor against the \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n mortgagee in possession, an irrebutable presumption of a deed arises on grounds of public policy.\n The supreme court of Illinois in the present case decides that the act of 1872 applies to mortgagees in possession, and that it operates not simply as a statute of limitations on the right to obtain a deed, but in effect as a statute forfeiting, by the nullification of the certificate, the mortgagee's estate and right of possession by reason of laches, and means that if a deed be not taken out within the time specified, the mortgagee has lost his debt, and the mortgagor has been reinstated in his former title by operation of law, and without having paid anything in redemption. Accepting the construction of the act by the state court, and its conclusion that it applies to Mrs. Bradley, then the question is whether such a statute so applied does not impair the obligation of the contract previously existing between the mortgagee and the mortgagor, or deprive the mortgagee of property rights without due process. That question was raised in the supreme court of Illinois, and the court held that it did not. 201 Ill. 511, 66 N. E. 546.\n Confessedly, subsequent laws which, in their operation, amount to the denial of rights accruing by a prior contract, are obnoxious to constitutional objection.\n In Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143, the statute objected to gave the mortgagor twelve months to redeem after the sale, and Mr. Chief Justice Taney said:\n'It declares that, although the mortgaged premises should be sold under the decree of the court of chancery, yet that the equitable estate of the mortgagor shall not be extinguished, but shall continue for twelve months after the sale; and it moreover gives a new and like estate, which before had no existence, to the judgment creditor, to continue for fifteen months. If such rights may be added to the original contract by subsequent legislation, it would be difficult to say at what point they must stop . . . . Any such modification of a contract by subsequent legislation, against the consent of \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n one of the parties, unquestionably impairs its obligations, and is prohibited by the Constitution.'\n\n In Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 U.S. 118\n, 41 L. ed. 93, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1042, it was held that a state statute which authorized redemption of property sold in foreclosure of a mortgage, where no such right previously existed, or extended the period of redemption beyond the time previously allowed, could not apply to a sale under a mortgage executed before its passage, and Mr. Justice Shiras, referring to Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 627, 637\n, 24 S. L. ed. 858, 862, said:\n'But this court held, through Mr. Justice Miller, that all the laws of a state existing at the time a mortgage or any other contract is made, which affect the rights of the parties to the contract, enter into and become a part of it, and are obligatory on all courts which assume to give a remedy on such contracts, . . . that it is therefore said that these laws enter into and become a part of the contract'-and that 'the remedy subsisting in a state when and where a contract is made and is to be performed is a part of the obligation.' . . .\n\n'What we are now considering is, whether the change of remedy was detrimental to such a degree as to amount to an impairment of the plaintiff's right; and, as this record discloses that the sale left a portion of the plaintiff's judgment unpaid, it may be fairly argued that this provision of the act [which provided that the land 'shall not again be liable for sale for any balance'] does deprive the plaintiff of a right inherent in her contract.\n\n'When we are asked to put this case within the rule of those cases in which we have held that it is competent for the states to change the form of the remedy, or to modify it otherwise, as they may see fit, provided no substantial right secured by the contract is thereby impaired, we are bound to consider the entire scheme of the new statute, and to have regard to its probable effect on the rights of the parties.'\n\n In Hooker v. Burr, \n194 U.S. 415\n, ante, p. 706, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 706, these and many other \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n cases were considered, and the distinction was pointed out between a purchase by the mortgagee and by an independent purchaser, having no connection whatever with the original contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee, and whose contract was made under the law as then existing; as well as the distinction where the mortgagee bids the whole amount of the mortgage debt, as in Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Cushman, \n108 U.S. 51\n, 27 L. ed. 648, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236, which was cited with approval. There the company bid enough to pay the full amount of the mortgage debt, principal and interest, and on redemption contended that it was entitled to interest at the rate existing at the time of the execution of the mortgage, which had been reduced before the sale, though subsequent to the mortgage. Barnitz v. Beverly was distinguished. In that case the sum bid at the foreclosure sale did not equal the amount due on the mortgage, the debt of the mortgagor was not thereby paid, and it was the mortgagee's rights under her contract as contained in the mortgage, and not her rights as a purchaser, that were in controversy. In the Cushman Case, on the contrary, the amount bid at the foreclosure sale paid the mortgage debt, and the subsequent position of the mortgagee was as a purchaser only.\n And we said: 'If the mortgage had been foreclosed, and the mortgagee had thereby realized his debt, principal and interest in full, upon the sale, there can be no doubt that he would not have been heard to assert the invalidity of the subsequent legislation, nor would an independent purchaser at the sale have been heard to make the same complaint. Of course, this does not include the case of a mortgagee who purchases at the foreclosure sale, and bids a price sufficient to pay his mortgage debt in full with interest, and an action thereafter commenced against him to set aside the sale because it was made in violation of legislation subsequent to the mortgage. In such case we suppose there can be no doubt of the right of the mortgagee to assert, as a defense to the action, the unconstitutionality of the subsequent legislation \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n as an impairment of his contract contained in the mortgage.'\n In Illinois the legal title vests in the mortgagee; but in equity that title is regarded as a trust estate to secure the payment of the money; and where the mortgaged premises are bid off by the mortgagee, at foreclosure sale, for the full amount of the decree, interest and costs, the mortgage may be held to have expended its force; but where the bid is for less than the full amount, a different rule would be applicable. Bogardus v. Moses, 181 Ill. 554, 559, 560, 54 N. E. 984.\n Entitled to pursue different remedies to collect the mortgage debt or to free the mortgaged premises of the right of redemption, foreclosure and sale, purchase and deed are in aid of the original title, and not inconsistent with it. Williams v. Brunton, 8 Ill. 600. If the right of redemption is determined by the efflux of time, which must be before a deed can issue, failure to take out the deed either has no effect, so far as the mortgagor is concerned, because he is not injured, or the right of redemption still remains, and all the mortgagor can claim is that the relation between the partices is unchanged.\n In the present case there was no independent purchaser; the bid of the mortgagee was less than one third of the amount found due; there was no redemption, and the right of redemption was cut off; the mortgagee was in possession before and at the time of foreclosure and sale, and when ejectment was brought, sixteen years thereafter; and the mortgage debt had never in fact been paid; so that the original mortgagor as plaintiff in ejectment could not recover, unless, by the subsequent law, the mortgagee had been subjected to the loss of all her rights, as against him, by laches in obtaining a deed, although, as a general rule, laches are not imputable to a party in possession to the loss of the right thereto.\n And if the operation of the subsequent law is to impair the obligation of Mrs. Bradley's mortgage contract, or to deprive her of rights protected by the Constitution, we cannot decline jurisdiction because of a construction that we deem untenable. \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens' Gaslight Co. \n115 \nU.S. 683, 697\n, 29 S. L. ed. 510, 515, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265; Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v. Indiana, 194 U. S. --, post, p. --, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767.\n By the judgment in this case Lightcap had been held clothed with the legal title and the immediate right of possession. And this on the ground that the certificate of purchase discharged the McCune mortgage, and that the act of 1872 nullified the certificate after the lapse of five years. This gave to the limitation of time for taking out the deed the effect of destroying the right of possession taken under the mortgage, wiping out the mortgage with the certificate, and allowing the mortgagor to assert the legal title and right of possession as against the mortgagee as a wrongdoer. That is to say, though Mrs. Bradley was rightfully in possession, and though the mortgage debt had not in fact been paid, the bar of the statute as to the deed is held to be efficacious in turning Mrs. Bradley into a trespasser as respects the mortgagor, who, not having in fact paid anything, is treated as having made payment by the mortgagee's bid, and being at the same time entitled to assert the failure of the purchase by reason of Laches in taking out the deed.\n And yet, because a statute may take away the sword which a deed would give a mortgagee out of possession, it does not follow that it can lawfully operate on prior transactions so as to take away the shield afforded by possession. Rightful possession is a defense in ejectment ( Sands v. Wacaser, 149 Ill. 530, 533, 36 N. E. 960, and cases cited), and Mrs. Bradley's possession could only be treated as wrongful as against the original mortgagor by the application of the subsequent law.\n As we have said, when Mrs. Bradley took this mortgage there was no statutory limitation as to the time within which a master's deed must be taken out, and no loss of right by reason of failure to do so was prescribed. After she had filed her bill, and while she was in possession, the act of 1872 went into effect, and, it may be conceded, limited Mrs. Bradley's right to obtain a deed on foreclosure sale, and so far affected \n\n[195 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n any remedy through a deed she might have had. But, reading the act, as the view of the supreme court compels us to do, as taking away her right to maintain her possession, we are of opinion that it materially impairs the obligation of her contract, and deprives her of property without due process.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADLEY v.

But he thought that Mrs. Bradley's title by possession as mortgagee had not been held by the state court to have been cut off by the statute of 1872, as the record in that court stood, as reported in 186 Ill. 510, 58 N. E. 221, and that, therefore, the constitutional question did not arise. If, however, the supreme court had ruled that her title as mortgagee in possession had been so destroyed, the remedy was by writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States. The decision in 201 Ill. 511, 66 N. E. 546, was rendered February 18, 1903. Taking into view the controversy as presented in the two other cases, and that the judgments in those cases are now directed to be reversed, and bearing in mind that a case does not necessarily arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States every time a writ of error would lie to the judgment of the state court, the decres of the Circuit Court will be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v.

The case was presented upon bill and demurrers. The demurrers were sustained and the bill dismissed. 112 Fed. 577. The ruling was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 55 C. C. A. 475, 118 Fed. 981.\n The People's National Bank of Denver was incorporated on the 1st of August, 1889, as a national bank under the national banking act. Its capital stock was $300,000, and its corporate existence to be twenty years. In September, 1889, the appellee Schleier was the owner of lots 1, 2, 3, and 4 in block 75 \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n in the city of Denver, and on that day made a lease thereof to the bank for the period of ninety-nine years from the 1st day of November, 1890, with an option to extend the term for a further period of fifty years, at an annual rental of $13,975, payable monthly. The bank covenanted to remove, at its expense, buildings located on the lots within a designated period, and to erect thereon a building four stories in height, at a cost of not less than $100,000, which should at once become part of the realty. The bank also covenanted to keep the building and premises in repair and pay all taxes thereon. And it was covenanted that in case of default in the payment of rent, taxes, or performance of other conditions, for the period of fifteen days, Schleier should have the right after thirty days' notice, to sell and dispose of the lease and all the right and title of the bank thereunder, or to maintain personal actions for the rent or texes he might have to pay. The heirs, representatives, and assigns or successors of the parties were entitled to the benefits of the lease and were to be bound by its covenants.\n The bank erected a building on the lots at an expense of $305,735.30, completing the same January, 1891. The building contained necessary offices for the use of the bank, which were occupied by it until it ceased to do business. The building also contained other offices and rooms which the bank rented to parties not connected with it, and to the People's Savings Bank, a corporation organized under the laws of Colorado.\n On the 19th of July, 1893, the bank being unable to pay its depositors, it was placed in the hands of the Comptroller of the Currency, and one J. B. Lazier was appointed receiver thereof, who remained in charge of its affairs until August 21, 1893. On that day the bank agreed to make a voluntary assessment to restore the impairment of its capital, and the receiver was discharged. The directors and officers of the bank then took charge of its business and conducted it until the appointment of the receiver herein. \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n The bill alleges that the affairs of the bank were very 'much involved, mixed, and commingled' with those of the People's Savings Bank, and by reason thereof the latter was unable to proceed with its business, and made a general assignment of its assets to Fermor J. Spencer, who has ever since remained in charge and control thereof. As such assignee he sued the People's National Bank and recovered a judgment for the sum of $ 475,825.71, which has not been paid.\n In January, 1897, the bank commenced to take steps looking to a voluntary liquidation and surrender of its charter, and on or about the 27th of April, 1897, the stockholders published a notice of the bank's intention to go into liquidation, and fixed the 27th of June as the last day on which claims could be presented. Prior to that day Spencer, having commenced suit against the bank for an accounting and adjustment of the matters between the banks, served a summons therein, and also having given notice to the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of the claims and demands of the savings bank, an agreement was entered into between Spencer and the People's National Bank, whereby he agreed to refrain from taking any further steps in said suit until January 1, 1898, without prejudice by reason of the delay. The bank on its part agreed, in consideration of the delay, that it would 'take no further action of any kind or nature whatsoever to the prejudice of the savings bank,' or any action for the surrender of its charter or the disposal of its property, 'to the prejudice of the savings bank.'\n On the 20th of September, 1897, the People's National Bank called and gave notice of a special meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of considering the proposition to turn over its building to Schleier, the owner of the land, and at the meeting held October 27, 1897, in pursuance of the notice, it was resolved so to do in consideration of a release by Schleier to the bank and its stockholders from all liability which might thereafter accrue under the terms of the lease. The lease was thereupon canceled and the premises surrendered to Schleier. This \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n is alleged by appellant to have been in violation of the statutes of the United States, and contrary to the principles of equity governing the distribution and disposition of assets in the payment of dividends on dissolution of insolvent corporations.\n It is also alleged, on information and belief, that the notice of the stockholders' meeting stated that the income of the property was less than the fixed charges, and that it was so stated at the stockholders' meeting by the officers of the bank and by Schleier's attorneys and agents, but such was not the case. On the contrary, it is alleged, on information and belief, that the income of the property, even in the condition which the neglect of the bank had brought it, was sufficient to pay the rents and all charges due under the lease and keep the building in good order and repair.\n The grounds of the demurrers were want of equity and laches. The demurrers were sustained and the bill ordered to be dismissed.\n The judgment of dismissal was entered December 30, 1901. On the 1st of February, 1902, appellant tendered an amended bill of complaint and moved for leave to file the same. The motion was denied. This action is assigned as error as well as the ruling on the demurrers.\nMessrs. James H. Brown and Harper M. Orahood for appellant.\n Messrs. John M. Waldron, R. D Thompson, G. C. Bartels, J. H. Blood, and John F. Shaproth for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The bill prayed for a decree declaring the lease between the bank and Schleire and the instruments surrendering and canceling the same to be declared void and 'ultra vires of the acts \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n of Congress of the United States in respect to the powers of national banks to acquire, own, and hold real estate or to be or become indebted in the exercise of corporate powers, and that no title or right, legal or equitable, could be acquired under the same or either thereof by the said defendant Schleier to the said bank building and the appurtenances thereunto belonging.' An accounting was also prayed, and that the amount found due be declared a lien upon the building and lots, and they be sold to satisfy the lien. The circuit court of appeals regarded the bill as charging, not only the initial, but the dominant and determining, wrong to be the lease; that being Schleier's participation in the alleged diversion of the bank's funds, constituting him a trustee for creditors. It was, therefore, natural for the court to observe the theory of the bill was that the lease was void, and that Schleier was liable for the damages which the creditors of the bank sustained in consequence of its execution without lawful authority. The court discussed that theory, and decided (1) that the power conferred by  5137 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3460) upon national banks to purchase real estate needed for their accommodation in the transaction of their business included the power of leasing property whereon to erect buildings suitable for their wants; (2) assuming the transaction to have been ultra vires, the complainant (appellant) was not, by virtue of his office as receiver, 'authorized to challenge or impeach it.'\n Appellant now says that the conception of the bill by the circuit court of appeals was incorrect, and 'not only limits, but completely reverses the theory of the bill, in a manner totally inconsistent with the admitted allegations.' And appellant concedes 'that only the government may complain of an executed ultra vires conveyance of real estate to a corporation,' and rests his case upon 'loss of the moneys and assets of the bank,-in the form of the bank building,-to which Schleier claims title through the conveyance and surrender on October 30, 1897, under the terms of his lease to the bank.' \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n We may take appellant at his word and omit extended discussion of the first proposition, although he has indulged in much argument which confuses his concessions. For instance, his counsel say: 'While denying the sufficiency of the lease to lawfully bind either the bank or its title to its $305,000 capital assets, we say, very well, then! Since in the completed building in the actual possession of the bank, it still had an asset, the then depositors, now judgment creditors of this bank, represented by this appellant receiver, want to know why Schleier, who is not an innocent purchaser for value, without notice, should not be held liable to account for this asset, the building?'\n But pronouncing Schleier not an innocent purchaser, denominating the building an asset of the bank, does not change the issues in the case. It is only another way of presenting them. Why should Schleier account for the building? Necessarily, either because of the execution of the lease or its surrender. Of its execution we need not make much comment. The lease certainly was not different from any other interest in real estate acquired ultra vires,-no more vulnerable to attach, no more a diversion of funds. Whether it would be a gain or loss-an antithesis made much of in argument to distinguish between the lease and an absolute conveyance-was a matter of judgment. It seems now to have been a folly for the bank to have put its whole capital in a building. But maybe that is the confident conclusion which can be formed after experience. The judgment of the bank in making the lease and erecting the building seems not to have been thought by creditors to have been improvident, and the Comptroller of the Currency did not disapprove. The bill alleges that the Comptroller of the Currency, in the year 1893, deemed an assessment of 20 per cent sufficient to redeem the bank from embarrassment and establish it as a solvent concern; and its chief creditor, the People's Savings Bank, whose affairs, the bill avers, had become 'commingled and mixed' with those of the bank and thereby associated with its fortunes, \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n must have had absolute confidence in the value of the building, even though it represented diverted funds. If depreciation came afterwards, it was a misfortune. Under the concession of appellant, therefore, the validity of the lease must be assumed as against him, and the inquiry confined to the validity of the surrender; and that depends upon the condition of the bank at the time it was done. In other words, the lease, with its benefits or burdens, and the condition of the bank at the time of its surrender, must be the test of the action of the bank officers and the rights of creditors.\n The bank was insolvent, taxes on the property were unpaid, and three months' rent was due. Under the terms of the lease, Schleier could pay the taxes, and for reimbursement and the satisfaction of the rent could sell the lease and all the right, title, and interest of the bank therein, or maintain personal actions for such taxes and rent. Schleier, therefore, for what was then due and for his monthly accruing rent, had not only a lien upon the property, but had, as well, the personal obligation of the bank. Against this liability what had the bank? The bill alleges nothing but the lease, and to that no value is assigned. Its revenue did not exceed its obligations. It is true it is alleged that the building had been allowed to get out of order, and that, notwithstanding its condition, the rents from it would have paid the charges against it. But the fact establishes nothing definite. What can be inferred from it? Such disproportion between the value received by Schleier and that received by the bank as to shock the conscience, establish fraud, and that the surrender of the lease was an illegal preference? The situation must be kept in mind. The bank was and had been insolvent. It was compelled to go into liquidation; it was in arrears for rent and taxes, and was confronted with everrecurring liabilities which it might not be able to discharge. Certainly could not discharge unless it remained a going concern, which was not possible. Under such circumstances the settlement with Schleier does not seem to have been even bad judgment. And it was openly done,- advertised \n\n[194 U.S. 18, 25]\n\u00a0\n in advance to all who were interested to prevent,-and the reason for it declared to be that the income of the property was less than the fixed charges; in other words, had no value,-represented only liabilities. No one intervened. Creditors did not, and this suit was not brought until December, 1900,-three years after the surrender of the lease. The conclusion is irresistible that the judgment of the stockholders in surrendering the lease was honestly and prudently exercised. This is fortified by the prayer of the bill. Appellant does not ask to have the surrender of the lease set aside and the bank restored to its relations and obligations to Schleier. He asks that the bank be relieved from all obligations, and the cost of the building imposed as a charge upon the real estate.\n It is unnecessary to discuss the ruling of the circuit court on the motion to file an amended bill. The bill tendered was fuller and more explicit than either the original bill or the amendments thereto, but it alleged nothing which would affect the legal conclusions from the facts to which we have adverted. And we may observe that it is exceedingly disputable whether it is an abuse of discretion to deny a motion to file an amended bill after final judgment has been entered.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRUNSWICK TERMINAL CO. v.

The demurrer was overruled, the defense sustained, and the bill dismissed. 88 Fed. 607. On appeal to the circuit court of appeals for the fourth circuit, the decree was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. 48 L. R. A. 625, 40 C. C. A. 22, 99 Fed. 635.\n The cause was then heard on the pleadings, and an agreed statement of facts, the parties reserving the right to refer to any pertinent laws or statutes of Georgia, as follows:\n'That the Brunswick State Bank was a corporation chartered, organized, and existing under the laws of the state of Georgia, and was engaged in the general banking business in that state; that on or about the 30th day of May, 1893, William M. Wiggins and others alleging themselves to be creditors of said Brunswick State Bank, filed their petition in the superior court of Glynn county, Georgia, against said bank, alleging that it was insolvent, and praying for the appointment of a receiver to take possession of its assets, and administer them, and on the 29th day of June following the court decreed that the bank was insolvent and appointed a permanent receiver for the purposes stated; that the state of Georgia and Glynn county were, under the laws of Georgia, preferred creditors, and the assets obtained by the receiver as the assets of the bank were exhausted in the payment of these preferred claims \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n and the costs of litigation, and nothing was left for the payment of other creditors of the bank; that the following persons are creditors of the said Brunswick State Bank in the amounts stated in connection with their names, and were originally parties plaintiff in said cause, or having become such subsequently, that is to say: [Here follow lists of creditors.]\n\n'That the defendant is a national bank, chartered, organized, and conducting a business of a bank at the city of Baltimore, in the state of Maryland, under the provisions of the statutes of the United States in relation to national banks and their operation.\n\n'That in the month of August, 1890, the defendant discounted for one Lloyd a promissory note drawn by him, and F. E. Cunningham for the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), indorsed by the copartnership firm of Lloyd & Adams, and by W. A. Cunningham, and received, together with the note, as the collateral security for its payment, one hundred and ten (110) shares of the capital stock of said Brunswick State Bank of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per share; that, in order to protect itself as pledgee, the defendant caused this stock to be transferred into its own name on the books of the Brunswick State Bank, on or about the 25th day of August, 1890; that the said note was paid to the defendant at the time of its maturity, and the defendant being under obligation to return the stock, the pledge being at an end and the pledgeor entitled to its return, retransferred the stock on the books of said Brunswick State Bank by direction of the pledgeor, and the said transfer was fully completed on the books of the said bank on or before the 20th day of October, 1890, but no notice by publication of the fact of said retransfer was given by the defendant; that the defendant never had or claimed any interest in said stock, save under the pledge aforesaid, but never notified the Brunswick State Bank, its stockholders or creditors, that it held said stock otherwise than as the absolute owner thereof.\n\n'That the indebtedness of said Brunswick State Bank to \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n all of the plaintiffs in this cause accrued after the said 20th day of October, 1890, from transactions with said bank commenced after that date, and the plaintiffs had no knowledge in fact that the name of the defendant had appeared upon the books of said Brunswick State Bank as a stockholder.\n\n'It is agreed that the court may draw inferences from any of the foregoing facts to the same extent as if the facts had been proven by means of witnesses.'\n\n The circuit court rendered a decree dismissing the bill. 112 Fed. 812.\n An appeal to the circuit court of appeals was taken and that court certified to this court certain questions concerning which it desired instructions for the proper decision of the case. After full argument on the merits this court required the whole record and cause to be sent up for consideration.\nMessrs. Henry W. Williams, C. P. Goodyear, W. E. Kay, H. Winslow Williams, and William S. Thomas, for appellants.\n Messrs. Frank Gosnell, William L. Marbury, and Allan McLane for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Baltimore bank was a national bank, and was not authorized to permanently invest any portion of its capital in the stock of other corporations, nor did it attempt to do so in this instance. The shares of stock of the Brunswick bank were merely accepted as collateral to a note discounted by the Baltimore bank. They stood, it is true, for a few weeks in the name of the Baltimore bank on the registry of the Brunswick bank, but they were then retransferred to the pledgeor as appeared on the registry, the note having been paid. Complainants became creditors long after the transaction, and were chargeable with notice so far as the Baltimore bank was con- \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n cerned. But notwithstanding the latter bank only held the shares as collateral, and had returned the pledge in due course on the payment of the loan, the contention is that the bank is under a statutory liability to these subsequent creditors, to the full amount of the shares it had temporarily held as security.\n This additional liability of a stockholder depends on the terms of the statute creating it, and as it is in derogation of the common law, the statute cannot be extended beyond the words used.\n As to stockholders of the Brunswick bank, such a liability was imposed by the 9th section of the charter, granted in 1889, which provided 'that said corporation shall be responsible to its creditors to the extent of its property and assets, and the stockholders, in addition thereto, shall be individually liable equally and ratably, and not one for another, as sureties to the creditors of such corporation for all contracts and debts of said corporation, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, respectively, at the time the debt was created, in addition to the amount invested in such shares.'\n Tested by the language of this section, the Baltimore bank was never under liability to these creditors. For if this national bank could have been regarded as the owner of these shares from August 25 to October 20, 1890, notwithstanding the actual facts and the limitations on its powers, it was not such stockholder, in fact or in appearance, at the time complainants' debts were created. It acquired the stock as pledgee, August 25, 1890, and the note to which it was collateral, having been paid, retransferred it October 20, 1890, the retransfer being regularly entered on the books of the bank. It was after this that the transactions commenced from which the indebtedness to complainants arose, and no element of estoppel was involved.\n Nevertheless complainants contend that the Baltimore bank remained liable as a stockholder because it did not give notice of the retransfer under  1496 of the Georgia Code of 1882, reading as follows: \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n 'When a stockholder in any bank or other corporation is individually liable under the charter, and shall transfer his stock, he shall be exempt from such liability unless he receives a written notice from a creditor within six months after such transfer, of his intention to hold him liable; provided, he shall give notice once a month, for six months, of such transfer, immediately thereafter, in two newspapers in or nearest the place where such institution shall keep its principal office.'\n This section was obviously not intended to impose a liability, but to exempt from an existing liability. If any debt had been created from August 25 to October 20, and perhaps as to any debt outstanding on August 25, the Baltimore bank, treating it as a stockholder from August 25 to October 20, might have been held liable because it did not give the statutory notice, but no such case is presented. On the face of this record it is immaterial whether there were any creditors during the six months after the retransfer to give or to receive notice or whether there was any indebtedness incurred prior to August 25, or during the period from August 25 to October 20, 1890\n\n\n We concur in the views of the circuit court, as thus expressed by Morris, J.:\n'As by the charter of the Brunswick State Bank a stockholder was only liable as surety to creditors to the extent of his stock in the bank at the time the debt was created, and as the defendant, at the time the debts of the plaintiffs were created, had no stock in the bank and was therefore under no liability, it does not appear that  1496 of the Georgia Code could have any application to this defendant. This section is applicable to a stockholder who, being individually liable to a creditor or creditors, shall then transfer his stock. The stockholders in the Brunswick State Bank were only liable for debts created while they held their stock, and, as applied to them, this section means that a stockholder who has become individually liable to a creditor by holding stock at the time the creditor's debts were created shall be exempt \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n from such liability, provided he publishes a notice that he has transferred his stock, unless, within six months after the transfer, the creditor gives him notice that he intends to hold him liable. This would seem to be the plain meaning and intention of the statute.\n\n'As  1496 enables a stockholder who, by the charter, is already under liability to a creditor, to escape that liability by transferring his stock, unless the creditor gives him notice within six months after the transfer, it is sensible and understandable why notice of the transfer should be given; but, as to persons who as yet had no dealing with the bank out of which debts could be created, to require notice to them would not be sensible, and would be a mere arbitrary penalty, without reason,-a thing which is not to be imputed to the legislature if the section is capable of a more reasonable interpretation. If no notice of transfer by advertisement is given by the stockholder, then no notice within six months need be given by the creditor, and both stand upon the rights given by the charter, unaffected by  1496 of the Code.'\n\n But it is said that the highest judicial tribunal of Georgia has decided otherwise, and that the circuit court and this court are bound to accept its interpretation of these statutory provisions. Without discussing the exceptions to that rule the inquiry in the first instance is as to what has been actually decided by the supreme court of Georgia in respect of the construction and application of those provisions in circumstances such as exist in this case. We are referred to the cases of Brobston v. Downing, 95 Ga. 505, 22 S. E. 277, decided May Term, 1894; and Chatham Bank v. Brobston, 99 Ga. 801, 27 S. E. 790, decided December Term, 1895, which involved the charter of the Brunswick State Bank.\n The court delivered no opinion in Brobston v. Downing, but the first headnote by Bleckley, Ch. J., was in these words: 'With or without a clause in the charter restricting the personal statutory liability of stockholders to the \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n amount of stock at its par value at the time the debt in question was created, the liability exists and continues for any debt incurred by the corporation at any time until the stockholder who claims to be exempt by reason of having sold and transferred his stock before the debt was created has given notice of such sale, conformably to  1496 of the Code. Lumpkin, J., concurring dubitante.'\n This does not in terms refer to stock which has been held as collateral, and retransferred on payment of the loan.\n In the second case there was no opinion of the court, but the following headnotes appear:\n'1. The decisions of this court in the cases of Brobston v. Downing, and vice versa, and Brobston v. Chatham Bank, 95 Ga. 505, 22 S. E. 277, upon a review thereof, are affirmed.\n\n'2. Where the charter of a bank imposes on all of its stockholders personal liability to its creditors, such liability attaches as well to those who acquire a complete legal title to stock of the bank by having the same transferred to them as collateral security for debts due by the transferrers, as to those who purchase such stock outright.\n\n'3. Under the charter of the Brunswick State Bank, and the general rules of law applicable thereto, a stockholder is individually liable for his pro rata part of the corporation debts created before he acquired his shares of stock by transfer, as well as for a like part of those created during his ownership of the shares.\n\n'4. A stockholder in that bank is also liable to the same extent upon debts of the corporation created after he transferred his shares, unless he gave notice of the transfer, as prescribed in  1496 of the Code.'\n\n These were followed by four other head-notes, which need not be set forth.\n Of the three members of the court, Mr. Justice Lumpkin and Gober, J., filed an explanatory opinion, in which, after giving the 9th section of the Brunswick bank charter, and  1496 of the Code of 1882, they stated: \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n 'In the case of Brobston v. Downing, 95 Ga. 505, 22 S. E. 277, this court in effect decided that a stockholder in this bank was individually liable for his pro rata part of the debts of the corporation created before he became a stockholder, as well as for a like proportion of the indebtedness incurred by it while he held his stock. This decision controls the present cases. Upon a review of it, duly allowed, Chief Justice Simmons and Justice Lumpkin are of the opinion that it should be affirmed; and Judge Gober, being thus bound by it, of necessity concurs in the judgments now rendered. He is nevertheless of the opinion that in dealing with the cases reported in 95 Ga. Supra, the court, in so far as it held that a stockholder of this bank could be made liable for any debt created by it before he actually became a stockholder, misconstrued that portion of the bank's charter which is quoted above. If free to do so, he would hold that, under the language just referred to, the individual liability of a stockholder of this corporation is limited to such debts only as were contracted during the time be was an owner of stock and up to the date when, relatively to such liability, he legally severed his connection with the corporation. We all agree that any such owner, although he may have transferred his stock, would still be bound, under the above-cited section of the Code, for whatever liability the charter fixed upon him, unless he gave the notice provided for by that section.\n'In 1894 an act was passed by the general assembly which materially modifies the law bearing upon this subject, in that it dispenses with any necessity for a stockholder, upon transferring his stock, to publish notice of the fact in order to be discharged from liability. That act declares that 'whenever a stockholder in any bank or other corporation is individually liable under the charter, and shall transfer his stock, he shall be exempt from such liability by such transfer, unless such bank or other corporation shall fail within six months from the date of such transfer.' Acts of 1894, p. 76; Civil Code, \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 395]\n\u00a0\n  1888. In view of the radical change thus made in the law, the difference of opinion which exists between the majority and the minority of the court as constituted for the hearing of the cases now in hand is, apparently, of but little practical importance, save as affecting the result of the present litigation. If another case should arise the decision of which would depend upon the question as to which we disagree, the whole matter would still be open to review by a bench of six justices. Accordingly, we have agreed among ourselves to let the present decision stand upon the headnotes as announced, with the foregoing explanation of our reasons for not entering upon a discussion as to what should be the proper construction of the bank charter now under consideration.'\n\n As the reference was to the increase of the number of justices from three to six, which followed soon after, we think this explanation indicated that it was contemplated that 'the whole matter would be open for review,' before the new bench, if another case arose. The power to re- examine would exist, and these remarks were evidently intended to suggest that in the circumstances it might be properly exercised. And this, although the point of disagreement was confined to the question whether liability attached in respect of indebtedness created\n Sections 1, 2, and 6 of the act of 1894 are as follows:\n Sec. I. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of Georgia, etc., That from and after the passage of this act, whenever a stockholder in any bank or other corporation is individually liable under the charter, and shall transfer his stock, he shall be exempt from such liability by such transfer, unless such bank or other corporation shall fail within six months from the date of such transfer.\n Sec. II. Be it further enacted, That the stockholders in whose name the capital stock stands upon the books of such bank or other corporation at the date of its failure shall be primarily liable to respond upon such individual liability; but upon proof made that any of said shareholders at the date of the failure are insolvent, recourse may be had against the person or persons from whom such insolvent shareholder received his stock, if within a period of six months prior to the date of the failure of such bank or other corporation.\n Sec. VI. Be it further enacted, That all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this law be, and the same are, hereby repealed. \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 396]\n\u00a0\n before the particular stockholders sought to be charged became such.\n We conclude, therefore, that the questions before us have not been so definitively determined by the state court as to entitle such determination to be adopted and applied in this case. And this conclusion is confirmed by other considerations. The foregoing decisions were rendered in 1894 and 1895, and the Baltimore bank was not a party to the litigation and was never within the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts. The transaction with this bank occurred in 1890, and fully terminated October 20 of that year.\n When it took the collateral shares in its own name, it seems to us that it had the right to assume that it ran no risk of incurring liability by virtue of the terms of the charter of the Brunswick bank for indebtedness created after, in the ordinary course of business, it ceased to hold the stock, and that it could not reasonably have supposed that  1496 of the Code of Georgia was intended arbitrarily to make all who might have held the stock of the Brunswick bank from time to time liable for every transaction during twenty years (the period of limitations), after they had ceased to be stockholders.\n There had been no such ruling in respect of the statutory liability imposed by the charter of the Brunswick bank on its stockholders when the loan was made and paid, and the cases cited from Georgia reports prior to 1894, all of which we have carefully examined, dealt with different provisions, and involved different considerations.\n The charter of the Brunswick bank was granted in 1889, at which time  1496 had been in force for many years, and its application could only extend to the liability imposed by the charter,-namely, liability for indebtedness created while the relation of stockholder existed. The words 'at the time the debt was created,' must be held to have been providently inserted as words of limitation, and cannot be rejected nor rendered inefficacious by the prior law, which only applied to the actual situation, and did not control it nor purport to do so. \n\n[192 U.S. 386, 397]\n\u00a0\n The question is not whether all stockholders remained such if notice were not published, but whether the liability as stockholders, as to subsequent transactions, continued in spite of the termination of that relation, and that question is answered by the explicit terms of the 9th section of the charter.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBULLIS v.

O'Beirne, in behalf of himself and other bondholders, filed a complaint, setting forth, among other things that, on September 8, 1899, Bullis and one Barse owned the capital stock of three railroads,-two organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and one under the laws of the state of New York,-which railroads were constructed for the purpose of reaching timber on large tracts of land. At that time length of the railroads was about 16 miles, but an extension of the lines was contemplated so as to cover about 30 miles. Certain agreements are alleged between said Bullis and Barse and a firm of bankers,-Newcombe & Company, of New York,-by the terms of which Bullis and Barse were to execute a mortgage to the Central Trust Company of New York, to secure $250,000 of first-mortgage bonds, running thirty years, which mortgage was to cover the railroad properties and 30,000 acres of timber lands in McKean \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 608]\n\u00a0\n county, Pennsylvania. The property was to be under the management of a new corporation to be organized with a capital stock of $250,000. Various agreements were made as to the organization and management of said corporation. Another agreement was entered into between the parties, providing for the merger and consolidation of the railroads into a new company, with a capital stock of $500,000, and for a mortgage to the Central Trust Company, as trustee, to secure $500,000 of first-mortgage bonds. The railroad lines were to be extended to 70 miles, and 16,000 acres of timber lands to be included, making 46,000 acres to be owned by the new company. $300,000 of the bonds were to be put upon the market, to represent 46 miles of the railroad. Newcombe & Company were to dispose at par of $260,000 of these bonds, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Bullis and Barse were to enter into an agreement for consolidating the said railroads into one system, by agreement with the International Interior Construction & Improvement Company. On September 10, 1899, the construction company made a contract with the Allegheny & Kinzua Railroad Company, owned by Bullis and Barse, and one with Bullis and Barse, providing for the construction and consolidation of the railroads and for the distribution of the proceeds of the bonds, a considerable portion of which were to be given to Bullis and Barse.\n The complaint specifically charges: That Bullis and Barse falsely and fraudulently pretended and represented to the said firm of I. B. Newcombe & Company that said tract of 30,000 acres to be conveyed was free and clear from all encumbrances; that all of said land was contiguous or adjacent to the line of said railroad as the same was then constructed or surveyed or projected, and the said land was covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber, capable of yielding and producing 70 tons of freight in timber, lumber, and bark for each acre of land, for transportation over said railroad. It is further alleged that, in fulfilment of said agreements, the \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 609]\n\u00a0\n defendant railroad corporation, on the 1st day of February, 1890, executed its first mortgage deed of trust to said trust company, conveying to it said railroad properties and franchises, and providing for an issue of bonds limited to $500,000, to be secured by said properties and the 46,000 acres of timber to be conveyed by said Bullis and Barse to said trustee. That the defendants Bullis and Barse caused the said Bullis and Sarah E., his wife, to join with said railroad company in said mortgage, and that by said mortgage they assumed to convey to said trustee land contiguous to the line of said railroad, and free from encumbrances, and covered by a quantity of merchantable timber, aggregating 30,954.10 acres, and which, by the terms of said agreements, was to be a condition precedent to the issue of $300,000 of said bonds, to be used in building and completion of said 46 miles of said railroad; that, in reliance upon the conveyance of said lands, bonds to the amount of $300,000 were issued and were sold by Newcombe & Company, ten of which were purchased by the plaintiff in the action; that all the proceeds of the said bonds have been used in the construction of said lines and in the payment of prior liens upon the property and the constituent lines, and that the defendant railroad company, which is the consolidated company, is wholly without funds, and that the extension thereof is essential to enable it to obtain money to meet its liabilities; that said Bullis and Barse refused to convey to said trustees the remaining 16,000 acres of such land and to provide for the building of the balance of said railroad, whereby the construction company is unable to proceed with its work of completing the same.\n The complaint further alleges that said 30,954.10 acres of land, conveyed by Bullis and his wife, were not free from encumbrances; that the same at the time were subject to prior liens aggregating $159,000, besides interest; that $144,776.07 of said indebtedness still remain unsatisfied; that said land was not covered with merchantable timber, but was waste land, from which the salable timber had been removed, \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 610]\n\u00a0\n and that a large portion of said land was not adjacent to the line of said railroad, and the timber thereon not accessible to be transported thereon; that a large portion of the land so assumed to be conveyed was not owned by either of the said defendants, and was not conveyed at all by said deed. All of which facts the said Bullis and Barse well knew at the time they made said pretended conveyance, and said conveyance is in reality false and fraudulent; that by reason of the fraud and failure of said Bullis and Barse to convey said land free of liens a great fraud has been committed by them which will cause irreparable injury to the bondholders, including the plaintiff, unless the performance of the said agreements and the conveyance of 30,000 acres of unencumbered timber land to said trustee are specifically decreed.\n The prayer of the complaint is--\n'Wherefore, plaintiff demands judgment that immediate specific performance by the said defendants Bullis and Barse and said defendant railroad company of their said agreements to convey unto the trustee of said defendant railroad company's mortgage, and place under the lien of said instrument 30,000 acres of timber land contiguous or tributary to the line of railroad of said railroad company, as in said agreements stated, free of all encumbrance of whatsoever nature prior to the said mortgage above mentioned; or that said defendants pay to said trustee, for the security of said bondholders, such a sum of money as the court shall ascertain to be equivalent to the value of said lands and real estate, conveyed as aforesaid, which are not in conformity with the terms of said several agreements, and said bonds, and the mortgage, or deed of trust, securing the same; and in addition thereto 16,000 acres of like timber land, in all respects similarly situated, and free from encumbrance, as security to authorize the issue of $200,000 of bonds in said agreements specified, and set apart for the construction of the 24 miles of railroad of said company additional to the 46 miles above mentioned.' \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 611]\n\u00a0\n And for injunction and general relief.\n\n The case was tried at special term of the New York supreme court. That court dismissed the complaint, holding that, as Bullis and Barse did not own the lands, specific performance could not be decreed, and the case could not be held for the assessment of damages. This judgment was reversed by the general term. 80 Hun, 570, 30 N. Y. Supp. 588. Upon appeal taken by the Allegheny & Kinzua Railroad Company, one of the defendants, this judgment in general term was affirmed by the court of appeals of New York. 151 N. Y. 372, 45 N. E. 873. Bullis and Barse, after the reversal at general term, went to trial at special term, and, upon the allegations of fraud, findings were made, among others: That Bullis and Barse pretended and represented to the said firm of Newcombe & Company that the 30,000 acres of land were timbered, free and clear of all encumbrances, and contiguous and adjacent to the line of the defendant railroad company, as the same was then constructed and projected, and that said land was covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber, which would actually provide said railroad company with at least 70 tons to the acre, for conveyance over said railroad at rates from 25 to 50 cents per ton, in addition to the percentage accruing to said defendant railroad company from divisions of other lines. That said agreements were entered into at the request of Bullis and Barse; that engineers were sent from New York to inspect the timber on the land to be conveyed; they were escorted through certain timber lands by said Bullis, and these lands were heavily timbered, and said Bullis stated that said lands were to be placed under the mortgage to the trustee, and a report in accordance with this statement was made by the engineers, and upon this report said Newcombe & Company embarked in the enterprise, and entered into said scheme of consolidation and extension. That the lands so defined and pointed out were worth from $ 18 to $20 an acre. That Bullis and Barse had stated to Newcombe & company that the mortgage was to be a first lien, the lands to be well tim- \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 612]\n\u00a0\n bered, and contiguous and tributary to said line of railroad; that said trust mortgage was approved and accepted in the belief that said representations were true in fact, and that Bullis and Barse were, in good faith, performing their said covenants.\n The court further found that the plaintiff was, in fact, deceived by said statements and representations; that said statements and representations were false; that said agreement was, in fact, fraudulently made with respect to the lands agreed to be conveyed by Bullis and Barse; that a great part of the lands included in the deed was not the property of Bullis, and the value of that owned by him, and not timbered, was $13, 350, while that apparently covered by the deed, but not owned by him, was worth $175,502.77, and a considerable part of that included in the conveyance was encumbered; that the statements of Bullis and Barse with respect to said timber lands were false and fraudulent, and made with intent to deceive.\n As a conclusion of law, the court decided that it had jurisdiction to proceed in the cause by reason of the fraud practised by the defendants Bullis and Barse in the premises, and because of the fact that the plaintiff had been deceived by the fraudulent statements and misrepresentations of the defendants. This decision was affirmed. O'Beirne v. Bullis, 2 App. Div. 545, 38 N. Y. Supp. 4. Upon appeal to the court of appeals of New York this judgment was affirmed. 158 N. Y. 466, 53 N. E. 211.\n It appeaning that Bullis and Barse were unable to specifically perform the original agreement, but that they were liable for false representations, judgment was rendered against them in favor of the Central Trust Company, representing the bondholders, in the sum of $341, 745.65, and for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,586.40.\n Messrs. Adelbert Moot and Charles S. Cary for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 606, 615]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Sullivan Smith and Adrian H. Joline for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action involves the construction of  17 of the bankrupt act of 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 550, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3428), as it stood prior to the amendment of February 5, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487].1 So far as it pertains to this case, this section is as follows:\n'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another , . . . (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in a fiduciary capacity.'\n\n In Crawford v. Burke, decided at this term, \n195 U.S. 176\n, ante, p. 9, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9, this court held that subd. 4 of this act was limited to frauds, embezzlements, misappropriations, or defalcations while acting in an official character, or in a fiduciary capacity, and did not apply to other debts or obligations fraudulently created. The question, therefore, presented in this case, is, Was the judgment against Bullis and Barse, as finally reached in the New York courts, one in 'an action for fraud' within the meaning of the act? \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 616]\n\u00a0\n It is distinctly charged in the complaint, and found in the judgment, that the agreement was fraudulently made; that Bullis and Barse falsely and fraudulently pretended that the large tract of timber land which they were to put under the mortgage for the security of the bondholders was free from all encumbrances; that it was near the line of the projected railroads, and covered by a large quantity of merchantable timber; when, in fact, as Bullis and Barse well knew, the 30,000 acres of timber land actually mortgaged was not free from encumbrances, but was subject to $159, 000 and interest of prior encumbrances, and that it was waste land from which the timber had been removed; that the lands were not adjacent to the lines of the railroads; that the timber was not accessible, and that a large portion of the land to be conveyed was not owned by either of the defendants; that all of these facts were well known to Bullis and Barse when they made the false and fraudulent representations aforesaid, and were relied upon to the prejudice of the bondholders. The New York courts found that the agents of the New York brokers attempting to negotiate the bonds, when they went to see the lands, were shown those not included in the mortgage, and which were falsely and fraudulently pointed out as being the intended lands. Under these allegations and proofs the New York courts have seen fit to render a money judgment, not for specific performance, as upon contract, but for the frauds charged against the defendants.\n As was said of the action and the relief granted, in the opinion of the appellate division (68 App. Div. 508, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1047, affirmed in 171 N. Y. 689, 64 N. E. 1119): 'The action for specific performance, in the strictest sense thereof, was founded upon the actual, positive fraud of the defendants Bullis and Barse. They had in fact, in pretended compliance with their agreements, conveyed to the designated trustee 30, 000 acres of land. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants fraudulently included in this conveyance lands not owned by the grantors, and the bulk of the tract was not timber land, was encumbered, and was \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 617]\n\u00a0\n not adjacent to the railroad lines described. . . . The gist, the intrinsic ingredient of the action, was consequently the fraudulent scheme- the false representations-of these defendants.'\n Considerable argument was made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error as to the essential allegations of a pleading where relief for fraud is sought. It is said that there is no averment in the complaint in this case of knowledge or intent to deceive upon the part of the plaintiff in error; but it is averred that the representations were falsely and fraudulently made, with the intent to further the pecuniary interest of the plaintiff in error, and were known to be false when made. Such allegations have frequently been held the equivalent of averments of specific intent. Indeed, it is difficult to perceive how a statement falsely and fraudulently made can be otherwise than intended to deceive. A statement fraudulently made, with knowledge of its falsity, must necessarily be intended to deceive. Bank of Montreal v. Thayer, 2 McCrary, 1, 7 Fed. 625, and cases cited in the opinion. It is argued that Bullis, one of the defendants, regarding the case as one for fraud, demanded a jury trial, which was denied him, and that this shows the character of the case. But, as appears in the opinion of the New York court of appeals (158 N. Y. 466-468, 53 N. E. 211), when the demand for a jury trial was made the defendants had not set up their inability to perform the contract, but had taken issue upon the allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. In this attitude of the case it was held that a jury trial was properly denied.\n But it is unnecessary to further consider questions of practice peculiar to the jurisdiction where the judgment was rendered. Whether the complaint sufficiently charged fraud to warrant the judgment given is not a Federal question. Forsyth v. Vehmeyer, \n177 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 44 S. L. ed. 723, 725, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 623. The question for this court is whether the judgment rendered by the New York court is in an action for fraud. If so, it is excepted from the effect of a discharge in bankruptcy. \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 618]\n\u00a0\n We think an inspection of the record as well as the interpretation put upon the pleadings and judgment by the courts of New York in the various trials and proceedings had show that the relief was granted upon the ground of fraud. When the case was first before the New York court of appeals, Judge Gray, delivering the opinion of that court, said:\n'The theory of the complaint and the tendency of the proof upon the trial were that a fraudulent scheme was devised by Bullis and Barse, having for its object the consolidation of certain railroad properties, owned and controlled by them, and the issuance of a large number of bonds by the consolidated company, which should be placed with the public at par through the cooperation of Newcombe & Company, whose assistance to the scheme, in the negotiation of the bonds, should be gained by representations and agreements of such a nature, as to the timber tracts to be furnished as additional security under the mortgage, that the bonds would appear to be attractive and salable securities. We are not called upon, at the present time, to pass upon the liability of Bullis and Barse for the parts they have played in the development and consummation of this scheme, inasmuch as they have gone back to a new trial; but, on the face of this record, that the evidence amply warranted the findings by the trial court is not to be denied; and it would have justified the granting of relief to the plaintiff had the case been in a shape to make that possible.' 151 N. Y. 372-384, 45 N. E. 873-876.\n\n When the case was sent back for trial, after it had been held that it might be retained for the assessment of damages, in its conclusions of law the supreme court at special term decided that it 'had jurisdiction to proceed in the cause by reason of the fraud practised by the defendants Bullis and Barse in the premises.' This manner of exercising jurisdiction by the lower court was expressly affirmed by the supreme court at general term (2 App. Div. 545, 38 N. Y. Supp. 4), and finally by the court of appeals of New York (158 N. Y. 466, 53 N. E. 211). In the latter case the court said: \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 619]\n\u00a0\n 'The theory upon which the decision proceeded was that they [Bullis and Barse] devised a fraudulent scheme for the consolidation of certain railroads owned and controlled by them, issued bonds upon false representations as to the timber lands to be furnished as added security under the mortgage to make the bonds secure and salable; that upon those facts the court would have been justified in granting relief to the plaintiff against them, and that the corporation, having been the instrumentality employed by them, was also liable. Thus it was that the liability of the appellants was involved in the decision. We adhere to the principle of our decision upon that appeal.'\n It is thus apparent that the courts of New York, in conformity to their own practice, have rendered a judgment against Bullis and Barse by reason of the fraudulent scheme found, and because of the fraudulent representations made to and relied upon by the parties to whom the relief was granted. The Federal question is, Is such a judgment entitled to be discharged in bankruptcy? Under the bankrupt law of 1867 it was provided: 'No debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in any fiduciary character, shall be discharged by proceedings in bankruptcy; but the debt may be proved, and the dividend thereon shall be a payment on account of such debt.' Rev. Stat.  5117.\n In the law of 1898, for reasons which have been the subject of much diversity of view in the courts, but which were sufficient in the judgment of Congress in passing the act to necessitate a change, it is provided, instead of exempting debts created by fraud from the operation of the discharge, that only judgments in actions for fraud shall be exempted. Under this act (as it was before the passage of the act of February 5, 1903) claims grounded in fraud will not be exempted unless reduced to judgment; but the essential character of the fraud which is here meant has not been changed. By the decisions of this court, which are collected in the \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 620]\n\u00a0\n opinion delivered in Forsyth v. Vehmeyer, \n177 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 44 S. L. ed. 723, 725, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 623, it was held, reviewing the former cases in this court, that, under the act of 1867, the fraud referred to meant positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, and not implied fraud, which may exist without an imputation of bad faith. 'Such a construction of the statute,' it was said in Neal v. Clark, \n95 \nU.S. 704, 709\n, 24 S. L. ed. 586, 587, 'is consonant with equity, and consistent with the object and intention of Congress in enacting a general law by which the honest citizen may be relieved from the burden of hopeless insolvency. A different construction would be inconsistent with the liberal spirit which pervades the entire bankrupt system.' This language, we think, equally applies to the present case. The difference is that, under the act of 1898, claims for fraud prosecuted to judgment will not be exempted. The reason for this change, as suggested by Mr. Justice Brown, in delivering the opinion in Crawford v. Burke, may be that Congress did not intend to offer any inducement to change unliquidated claims into actions for fraud, and therefore limited the exception from the operation of the discharge to such cases only as had been litigated and reduced to actual judgment. When such is the case we think a correct interpretation of the law does not require a close examination into the form of the action to determine whether technically it is one ex delicto or otherwise, but the real question is, Was the relief granted in the judgment based upon actual, as distinguished from constructive, fraud of the bankrupt? If the judgment is thus founded, whatever the form of the action, it is the intent and purpose of the law that the bankrupt shall not be discharged from it, but shall still rest under its obligation, so far as the bankrupt law is concerned.\n As thus interpreted, we think there can be no question that the judgment rendered in this case was based upon the fraud of Bullis and Barse. The facts charged and found showed false and fraudulent representations as to the character of the property which was to be the security of those who should \n\n[195 U.S. 606, 621]\n\u00a0\n purchase the bonds, and resulted in depriving them wrongfully of valuable rights. These findings were held sufficient in the state tribunals to warrant relief on the ground of fraud, and the judgment in this case is, in our opinion, in an action for fraud within the meaning of the bankrupt law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of New York is, therefore, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

Day for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 572, 574]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Donovan for defendant in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 572, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was convicted upon information filed in the district court of the eighth judicial district of the state \n\n[194 U.S. 572, 576]\n\u00a0\n of Montana of the crime of obtaining money under false pretenses. The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 27 Mont. 282, 70 Pac. 982.\n The false pretenses consisted of a false statement in writing made to the Royal Milling Company, a corporation, concerning his assets and liabilities, whereby he induced the company to sell him goods of great value.\n Plaintiff in error testified in his own behalf, and during the cross- examination he was questioned in regard to statements made by him in testimony made before the referee in bankruptcy in his own proceedings. No objection was made.\n In view of the examination the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n'The court instructs the jury that the fact that the defendant testified in an insolvency proceeding in obedience to a citation did not deprive him of his right to refuse to answer questions tending to criminate him, if he did answer any such questions, and an admission made by him in such proceeding is voluntary and competent evidence in a criminal prosecution subsequently inaugurated, where he was not in custody or charged with a criminal offense when he made such admission, if he did make any such.'\n\n Plaintiff in error excepted to the instruction as follows: 'For the reason that said instruction invades the province of the jury, in that it directs their attention to the alleged admissions of the defendant, and is a charge upon the effect and weight of the evidence. The defendant excepts to the instruction for the further reason that the same does not correctly state the law, in this: that it appears from the testimony that the defendant had testified upon an examination before a referee in bankruptcy, held pursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress, approved July 1, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 548, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3424], which said act provides as follows: chapter III., section, etc. 'But no testimony given by him [upon his examination] shall be offered in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding.' And the said instruction is against the law.' \n\n[194 U.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n The instruction seems to oppose the provisions of the statute, but the circumstances of the case must be considered. There was no objection made to the introduction of the testimony, and as we understand the instruction, it was but the expression of the value of the testimony. The contention of plaintiff in error must have been in the trial court as it was in the supreme court, and it here: to wit, that  7 of the bankruptcy act grants more than a mere immunity against the admission in evidence of the testimony given before the referee in bankruptcy,-that it grants him protection from prosecution for any crime growing out of the transaction about which he was examined; and this necessarily to secure to him to full protection of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which provides that 'no person shall be compelled in criminal cases to be a witness against himself.' Upon this broad contention he must now rely. A narrower contention might have been yielded to by the state courts. It certainly should have been submitted to them. The statute does not prohibit the use of testimony against the consent of him who gave it. It prescribes a rule of competency of evidence which may or may not be insisted upon. It does not declare a policy the protection of which cannot be waived. And the time to avail of it is when the testimony is offered. After the testimony is admitted, its probative force cannot be limited. This could not be contended even under the broader provision of the Constitution. A witness who voluntarily testifies cannot resist the effect of the testimony by claiming that he was not compellable to give it.\n In the case at bar, the court dealt with testimony which had been admitted without question or objection. We are brought, therefore, to the broad and ultimate contention of the plaintiff. We think it is untenable. There is no ambiguity in  7 of the bankrupt act. It requires a bankrupt to submit to an examination concerning his property and affairs, and provides: 'But no testimony given by him shall be offered in evidence against him in any criminal proceed- \n\n[194 U.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n ing.' It does not say that he shall be exempt from prosecution, but only, in case of prosecution, his testimony cannot be used against him.\n The two things are different, and cannot be confounded. The difference is illustrated by the different constructions this court has given to  860 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), and the provisions of the act of Congress of February 11, 1893 (chap. 83, 27 Stat. at L. 443, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3173).\n In Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 U.S. 547\n, 35 L. ed. 1110, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195, it was contended that the protection of  860 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661) was that of the Constitution, and it was sought to compel a witness to testify to matters which he claimed would incriminate him. This court held against the contention, and the witness was justified. We did not attempt to extend the section to the prohibition of criminal prosecutions, but confined its immunity to that which was expressed, to wit, that the testimony given should not 'be given in evidence, or in any manner used, against him or his property or estate, in any court of the United States, in any criminal proceeding. . . .'\n The act of February 11 was different and the ruling upon it was different. It provided as follows:\n'But no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before said commission, or in obedience to its subpoena or the subpoena of either of them, or in any such case or proceeding.'\n\n It was held in Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 40 L. ed. 819, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644, that the act was virtually one of 'general amnesty,' and the protection of the Constitution was 'fully accomplished by the statutory immunity.' As in Counselman v. Hitchcock, a witness before a grand jury which was investigating alleged violations of the Interstate Commerce Act claimed that questions addressed to him 'would tend to accuse and incriminate him.' Upon proceedings in the district court he was adjudged guilty of contempt, and ordered to pay a fine of $5 and to be \n\n[194 U.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n taken into custody until he should answer the question. He petitioned the circuit court for writ of habeas corpus, and from the judgment remanding him to custody prosecuted an appeal to this court. It was held that he was compellable to answer.\n In the case at bar, as we have already said, plaintiff in error did not claim the protection afforded him by the bankrupt act. He made no objection to the use of the testimony which he gave before the referee, nor does he now urge its use as error. He broadly claimed, and now claims, exemption from prosecution.

These teas, on re-examination by the board of general appraisers, were found to be inferior in quality to the standard prescribed by law; and Bidwell, as collector for the port of New York, so notified Buttfield. Thereupon the teas were withdrawn from the bonded warehouse, and exported. Judgment was entered for Bidwell upon a directed verdict in his favor. The right to reversal of that judgment is predicated solely upon the asserted unconstitutionality of the tea inspection act of March 2, 1897 [29 Stat. at L. 604, chap. 358, U. S. Comp.

STRANAHAN(1904)\nNo. 294\nArgued: January 4, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n This case presents for determination the question of the constitutionality of a statute known as the tea inspection act, approved March 2, 1897. (29 Stat. at L. 604, chap. 358, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3194.) The act is copied in full in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[192 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n On January 20, 1902, eight packages of tea were imported into the port of New York, per the steamer Adana, by a firm of which the plaintiff in error was the general partner. The tea was entered for import at the New York custom-house, \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n and was stored in a bonded warehouse. At that time certain standards, enumerated in the margin,2 which were selected by the board of tea inspectors, had been put in force by the Treasury regulations under said act of March 2, 1897\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n The eight packages of tea in question were embraced in the class known as 'Country green teas,' numbered 7 on list of standards. The tea was examined on February 7, 1902, and was rejected as 'inferior to standard in quality.' By the \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n term quality as thus used was meant the cup quality of the tea, that is to say, its taste and flavor. An appeal was taken by the importer to the board of general appraisers, and that board, on March 10, 1902, certified to the collector that 'the said tea is inferior in quality to the standard prescribed by law,' and accordingly overruled the appeal. The firm was notified of the decision on March 12, 1902.\n In November following the plaintiff in error-who had acquired the interest of his partner in the tea-applied to the collector for permission to withdraw the tea for consumption, on payment of the duties. The request was refused. Application was then made for the release of the tea from bond in order to export it. This was also refused on the ground that the tea had been finally rejected under the act of March 2, 1897, more than six months previous to the application. The plaintiff in error was also notified that the tea would be ordered to the public stores for destruction.\n This action was commenced in the supreme court of the state of New York, county of New York, against the collector of the port of New York, to recover damages for the alleged wrongful seizure, removal, and destruction of the tea in question. Averments were made of the importation, storing, tender of duties, and refusal to accept the same, and of demand for the tea and refusal to deliver. A general denial was filed. The action being on account of acts done by the defendant under the revenue laws of the United States, as collector of customs, it was removed, on his application, to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York. \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n At the trial of the case before Circuit Judge Coxe and a jury, the exhibit reproduced in the margin was introduced in evidence. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[] 1 Choicest Moyune 2 Choice Moyune Choicest Teenkai 3 Finest Moyune Choice Teenkai 4 Fine to Finest Moyune Finest Teenkai 5 Fine Moyune Fine to Finest Teenkai []\n 6 On Fine Moyune Fine Teenkai 7 Fully Good Medium Moyune On Fine Teenkai 8 Good Medium Moyune Fully Good Medium Teenkai Finest Fychow 9 On Good Medium Moyune Good Medium Teenkai Fine \" 10 Fair Moyune On Good Teenkai Good Medium Fychow Finest Wenchow 11 Good Common Moyune Fair Teenkai Fair \" Fine \" 12 Common Moyune Good Common Moyune Good Commmon \" Good Med. \" Good, clean, genuine Shanghai packed 13 Common Teenkai Common \" Fair \" 14 Good Common Wenchow 15 Common Wenchow []\n 16 Mixed, Shanghai packed 17 Common, refined and adulterated Shanghai packed [] \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n As indicated on this exhibit, the Country green teas thereon designated were arranged in their order of quality, from the highest to the lowest, No. 1 being the highest grade, and No. 17 the lowest. The designation in each perpendicular column represented the teas grown in a particular district, and all the teas enumerated on the same horizontal line were considered as being equal in grade.\n The chairman of the board of tea experts of the Treasury Department testified that the standard for Country green teas in force at the time the tea in question was imported was Hyson of a Fine Teenkai, or No. 6 on the list of standards, and that before fixing this standard 'the board made diligent search for any Country green teas of lower grades-Hysons of lower grades-of pure teas on the New York market obtainable by the trade, and were unable to find any.' The term Hyson, it may be observed, indicated that the tea was made out of the coarsest leaves. For the plaintiff it was testified that the quality of the tea in controversy corresponded in quality with the grade No. 7 on Exhibit 8; while the evidence for the government was to the effect that it would grade as Fair Fvchow, No. 11 on Exhibit 8. 8. The testimony also tended to show that the tea in question differed only in respect to the cup quality from the government standard; the evidence for the government being that it was 'a tea of a decidedly low grade, . . . a pure tea, but of low quality.'\n At the close of the evidence the court overruled a motion to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, and an exception was reserved. Thereupon the court, granting a motion on behalf of the defendant, instructed that the only question was as to the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant, as collector of the port, acted, and directed a verdict in his favor. Upon the judgment entered on the verdict, which was returned in accordance with this instruction, the case was brought directly to this court. \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n James L.

Summarized, the contentions are as follows: 1st, that the act of March 2, 1897, confers authority to establish standards, and that such power is legislative and cannot constitutionally be delegated by Congress to administrative officers; 2d, that the plaintiff in error had a vested \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 492]\n\u00a0\n right to engage as a trader in foreign commerce and as such to import teas into the United States which, as a matter of fact, were pure, wholesome, and free from adulteration, fraud, and deception, and which were fit for consumption; 3d, that the establishment and enforcement of standards of quality of teas, which operated to deprive the alleged vested right, constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law; 4th, that the act is unconstitutional, because it does not provide that notice and an opportunity to be heard be afforded an importer before the rejection of his tea by the tea examiner, or the tea board of general appraisers; and, 5th, that, in any event, the authority conferred by the statute to destroy goods upon the expiration of the time limit for their removal for export, and the destruction of such property without a judicial proceeding, was condemnation of property without hearing and the taking thereof without due process of law.\n Whether the contentions just stated are tenable are the questions for consideration.\n In examining the statute in order to determine its constitutionality we must be guided by the well-settled rule that every intendment is in favor of its validity. It must be presumed to be constitutional unless its repugnancy to the Constitution clearly appears. Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 515 S., 43 L. ed. 786, 791, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522; United States v. Gettysburg Electric R. Co. \n160 \nU.S. 668, 680\n, 40 S. L. ed. 576, 580, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427.\n The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations is expressly conferred upon Congress, and, being an enumerated power, is complete in itself, acknowledging no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution. Lottery Case, \n188 U.S. 321\n, 353-356, 47 L. ed. 492, 500, 501, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100, 108\n, 34 S. L. ed. 128, 132, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 36, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681. Whatever difference of opinion, if any, may have existed or does exist concerning the limitations of the power, resulting from other provisions of the Constitution, so far as interstate commerce is concerned, it is not to be doubted that from the beginning Congress has exercised a plenary power in respect to the exclusion of merchandise brought from foreign countries; not alone directly by the enactment of embargo statutes, but \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 493]\n\u00a0\n indirectly, as a necessary result of provisions contained in tariff legislation. It has also, in other than tariff legislation, exerted a police power over foreign commerce by provisions which in and of themselves amounted to the assertion of the right to exclude merchandise at discretion. This is illustrated by statutory provisions which have been in force for more than fifty years, regulating the degree of strength of drugs, medicines, and chemicals entitled to admission into the United States and excluding such as did not equal the standards adopted. 9 Stat. at L. 237, chap. 70; Rev. Stat.  2933, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1936.\n The power to regulate foreign commerce is certainly as efficacious as that to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes. And this last power was referred to in United States v. 43 Gallons of Whiskey, \n93 U.S. 194\n, 23 L. ed. 847, as exclusive and absolute, and was declared to be 'as broad and as free from restrictions as that to regulate commerce with foreign nations.' In that case it was held that it was competent for Congress to extend the prohibition against the unlicensed introduction and sale of spirituous liquors in the Indian country to territory in proximity to that occupied by the Indians, thus restricting commerce with them. We entertain no doubt that it was competent for Congress, by statute, under the power to regulate foreign commerce, to establish standards and provide that no right should exist to import teas from foreign countries into the United States, unless such teas should be equal to the standards.\n As a result of the complete power of Congress over foreign commerce, it necessarily follows that no individual has a vested right to trade with foreign nations which is broad in character as to limit and restrict the power of Congress to determine what articles of merchandise may be imported into this country and the terms upon which a right to import may be exercised. This being true, it results that a statute which restrains the introduction of particular goods into the United States from considerations of public policy does not violate the due process clause of the Constitution. \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 494]\n\u00a0\n That the act of March 2, 1897, was not an exercise by Congress of purely arbitrary power is evident from the terms of the law, and a consideration of the circumstances which led to its enactment. The history of the act and its proper construction, as also the reasons for deciding that the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury establishing the standard here in question were warranted by the statute, were succintly stated in the opinion of the court of appeals for the second circuit in Buttfield v. Bidwell, 37 C. C. A. 506, 96 Fed. 328, and we adopt such statement. The court said:\n'The basic question in this case is as to the true construction of the act of Congress of March 2, 1897,* entitled 'An Act to Prevent the Importation of Impure and Unwholesome Tea.' Section 1 makes it unlawful 'to import or bring into the United States any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards provided in  3 of this act, and the importation of all such merchandise is hereby prohibited.' Section 2 provides for the appointment by the Secretary of the Treasury, immediately after the passage of the act, and on or before February 15 of each subsequent year, of the board of tea experts, 'who shall prepare and submit to him standard samples of tea.' Section 3 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of said board, 'shall fix and establish uniform standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption of all kinds of teas imported into the United States,' samples of such standards to be deposited in various custom-houses, and supplied to importers and dealers at cost, and declares that 'all teas, or merchandise described as tea, of inferior purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to such standards shall be deemed within the prohibition of the first section hereof.' Sections 4-7 provide for the examination of importations of tea, for a re- examination by the board of general appraisers in case of a protest by the importer or collector against the finding of the primary examiner, and for testing the purity, quality, and fitness for consumption in all cases of examination or re-examination, 'ac- \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 495]\n\u00a0\n cording to the usages and customs of the tea trade, including the test of an infusion of the same in boiling water, and, if necessary, chemical analysis.' . . . The history of the enactment shows that the word [ 'quality'] was industriously inserted to make the act a more stringent substitute for the existing legislation. By the act of March 2, 1883 [22 Stat. at L. 451, chap. 64], then in force, any merchandise imported 'for sale as tea,' adulterated with spurious or exhausted leaves, or containing such an admixture of deleterious substances as to make it 'unfit for use,' was prohibited; and exhausted leaves were defined to include any tea which had been deprived of its proper quality, strength, or virtue by steeping, infusion, decoction or other means. Thus the importation of tea containing such an admixture of leaves as to be deprived of its proper quality or virtue by any method of treatment was prohibited. That act, however, contained no provision for the establishment of government standards; and the establishment of uniform standards in the interest of the importer and of the consumer had become a recognized necessity. In a report by the Senate committee on commerce, in 1897, the provision was suggested as designed, among other things, to protect the consumer against 'worthless rubbish,' and insure his 'receiving an article fit for use.' The report pointed out that the 'lowest average grade of tea ever before known was now being used' by our consumers, and proposed as a remedy the establishment of standards of the 'lowest grades of tea fit for use.' As originally introduced in the House, the bill prohibited the importation of 'any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity or fitness for consumption to the standards provided in  3 of this act.' It was amended in the Senate by inserting the word 'quality' between the words 'purity' and 'fitness for consumption' wherever they occurred in the House bill. The amendment evinces the intention of the Senate to authorize the adoption of uniform standards by the Secretary of the Treasury which would be adequate to exclude the lowest grades of tea, whether demonstrably of inferior purity, or unfit for consumption, or \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 496]\n\u00a0\n presumably or possibly so because of their inferior quality. The House concurred in the amendment, and the measure was enacted in its present terms. We conclude that the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury are warranted by the provisions of the act.'\n\n The claim that the statute commits to the arbitrary discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury the determination of what teas may be imported, and therefore in effect vests that official with legislative power, is without merit. We are of opinion that the statute, when properly construed, as said by the circuit court of appeals, but expresses the purpose to exclude the lowest grades of tea, whether demonstrably of inferior purity, or unfit for consumption, or presumably so because of their inferior quality. This, in effect, was the fixing of a primary standard, and devolved upon the Secretary of the Treasury the mere executive duty to effectuate the legislative policy declared in the statute. The case is within the principle of Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 36 L. ed. 294, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495, where it was decided that the 3d section of the tariff act of October 1, 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 567, chap. 1244], was not repugnant to the Constitution as conferring legislative and treaty- making power on the President, because it authorized him to suspend the provisions of the act relating to the free introduction of sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides. We may say of the legislation in this case, as was said of the legislation considered in Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, that it does not, in any real sense, invest administrative officials with the power of legislation. Congress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable, and from the necessities of the case was compelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing about the result pointed out by the statute. To deny the power of Congress to delegate such a duty would, in effect, amount but to declaring that the plenary power vested in Congress to regulate foreign commerce could not be efficaciously exerted.\n Whether or not the Secretary of the Treasury failed to carry into effect the expressed purpose of Congress and established \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 497]\n\u00a0\n standards which operated to exclude teas which would have been entitled to admission had proper standards been adopted is a question we are not called upon to consider. The sufficiency of the standards adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury was committed to his judgment, to be honestly exercised, and if that were important there is no assertion here of bad faith or malice on the part of that officer in fixing the standards, or on the part of the defendant in the performance of the duties resting on him.\n It is urged that there was denial of due process of law in failing to accord plaintiff in error a hearing before the board of tea inspectors and the Secretary of the Treasury in establishing the standard in question, and before the general appraisers upon the re-examination of the tea. Waiving the point that the plaintiff in error does not appear to have asked for a hearing, and assuming that the statute did not confer such a right, we are of opinion that the statute was not objectionable for that reason. The provisions in respect to the fixing of standards and the examination of samples by government experts was for the purpose of determining whether the conditions existed which conferred the right to import, and they therefore in no just sense concerned a taking of property. This latter question was intended by Congress to be finally settled, not by a judicial proceeding, but by the action of the agents of the government, upon whom power on the subject was conferred.\n It remains only to consider the contention that the provision of the statute commanding the destruction of teas not exported within six months after their final rejection was unconstitutional. The importer was charged with notice of the provisions of the law, and the conditions upon which teas might be brought from abroad, with a view of their introduction into the United States for consumption. Failing to establish the right to import, because of the inferior quality of the merchandise as compared with the standard, the duty was imposed upon the importer to perform certain requirements, and to take the goods from the custody of the authorities within a period \n\n[192 U.S. 470, 498]\n\u00a0\n of time fixed by the statute, which was ample in duration. He was notified of the happening of the various contingencies requiring positive action on his part. The duty to take such action was enjoined upon him, and, if he failed to exercise it, the collector was under the obligation, after the expiration of the time limit, to destroy the goods. That plaintiff in error had knowledge of the various steps taken with respect to the tea, including the final rejection by the board of general appraisers, is conceded. We think the provision of the statute complained of was not wanting in due process of law.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown, not having heard the argument, took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An Act To Prevent the Importation of Impure and Unwholesome Tea.\n Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after May first, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, it shall be unlawful for any person or persons or corporation to import or bring into the United States any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards provided in section three of this act, and the importation of all such merchandise is hereby prohibited.\n Sec. 2.

All teas, or merchandise described as tea, of inferior purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to such standards shall be deemed within the prohibition of the first section hereof.\n Sec. 4. That on making entry at the custom-house of all teas, or merchandise described as tea, imported into the United States, the importer or consignee shall give bond to the collector of the port that such merchandise shall not be removed from the warehouse until released by the collector, after it shall have been duly examined with reference to its purity, quality, and fitness for consumption; that for the purpose of such examination samples of each line in every invoice of tea shall be submitted by the importer or consignee to the examiner, together with the sworn statement of such importer or consignee that such samples represent the true quality of each and every part of the invoice, and accord with the specifications therein contained; or, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, such samples shall be obtained by the examiner and compared by him with the standards established by this act; and in cases where said tea, or merchandise described as tea, is entered at ports where there is no qualified examiner as provided in section seven, the consignee or importer shall, in the manner aforesaid, furnish under oath a sample of each line of tea to the collector or other revenue officer to whom is committed the collection of duties, and said officer shall draw or cause to be drawn samples of each line in every invoice, and shall forward the same to a duly qualified examiner, as provided in section seven: Provided, however, That the bond above required shall also be conditioned for the payment of all custom-house charges which may attach to such merchandise prior to its being released or destroyed (as the case may be) under the provisions of this act.\n Sec. 5.

TEXAS & P R CO(1904)\nNo. 57\nArgued: April 8, 1904Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This is an action to recover the value of cotton delivered by plaintiff to defendant, to be transported over its railroad from Texarkana, Texas, to New Orleans. The cotton was destroyed by fire while in the custody of defendant.\n The action was originally brought in the civil district court of the parish of Orleans, and removed, on the petition of defendant, to the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana. The case was tried to a jury, \n\n[194 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n which, under the instructions of the court, rendered a verdict for defendant, upon which judgment was entered dismissing the suit, with costs.\n The main question presented by the record is the effect of a provision in the bills of lading delivered by defendant to plaintiff, exempting it from liability for damages caused by fire. Incidentally a question arises as to the burden of proof. At the time of the delivery of the cotton there were four bills of lading issued by defendant,-three exactly alike, and the fourth substantially like the other three in all that is material to this case. They all contain the following provision: 'That neither the Texas & Pacific Railway Company nor any connecting carrier handling said cotton shall be liable for damages to, or destruction of, said cotton by fire. . . .'\n For the purpose of showing the delivery of the cotton to the defendant the plaintiff introduced in evidence the bills of lading, but without prejudice to his claim that the provision quoted was not binding, in the absence of a consideration therefor. The court admitted the bills of lading, with that limitation.\n The other evidence in the case was that the bills of lading in blank were obtained from the defendant's agent by plaintiff's agent, and three of them made out by the latter at his office. The record leaves doubtful whether the other bill of lading was prepared by him or by the agent of defendant. The former, however, testified that he did not know the fire clause was in the bills of lading, and further testified as follows:\n A. When I applied to the agent of the Texas & Pacific railroad for a rate to New Orleans on the cotton I was going to ship, he told me I could get but one rate, 60 cents per 100 pounds; that that was the rate of the other roads. And I gave them the cotton because it was the most direct line to New Orleans. I simply went there to get the rate, and I simply gave them the cotton at that rate which they gave me, 60 cents per 100 pounds.\n He also testified that he did not want to know the lowest \n\n[194 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n rate; that he asked for the correct rate; he knew there was but one rate, all of the roads having the same, and that it was against the law to give other rates.\n The following was the testimony as to the fire clause:\n Q. What I mean to say is this: Did you tell the agent of whom you asked for the rate that you did not want any fire clause in any bill of lading which he might issue to you?-A. No, sir.\n Q. Did you tell him that you wanted to ship your cotton without any fire clause in the bill of lading?-A. No, sir; because I did not know it was in the bill of lading.\n Q. Therefore you made no application to him, then, for a rate based on a bill of lading not containing the fire clause?-A. I made no application that way; I made no inquiries; I just asked for the rate.\n ... * *\n Q. Allowing that his reply to you was only one rate, was anything said by him as to the different kinds of contracts you could get?-A. No, sir; he never said anything to me at all.\n Q. Were you, or not, informed that you could get a contract under which the company would be liable as insurer, practically, and another kind of contract, under which they would not be liable for loss in case of fire?-A. No, sir.\n Q. Did you have any information, or did you know that if you wanted to make a choice between these two, that you could do it?-A. No, sir.\n The cotton was in the possession of the Union Compress Company when destroyed, to which company it had been delivered by defendant to be compressed, and that company had obtained insurance on it for the defendant, it being the custom of that company to effect insurance for the benefit, and in the name of, each particular railroad compressing cotton at their press. The testimony of the destruction of the cotton is that the Union Compress Company's building and platforms in Texarkana, Texas, were destroyed by fire September 19, 1900, in which the cotton was destroyed with other cotton. \n\n[194 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff requested instructions of the court which embodied the following propositions:\n\n 1. \nA carrier cannot limit his common-law liability without consent of the shipper, for consideration given.\n\n 2. \nThe mere contract of shipment is not such a consideration.\n\n 3. \nThe condition usually, though not necessarily, is a reduced rate; but in such case both rates must be offered shipper, and be reasonable, and the shipper given a genuine freedom of choice in making his selection; and if the evidence satisfied the jury 'there was no fair alternative or choice offered to plaintiff by defendant as between two rates, under one of which defendant would be liable for the loss of said cotton by fire, and under the other of which he would not be so liable,' the fire clause was not binding upon plaintiff, and the jury might 'deal with such bill of lading as though it did not contain such clause or stipulation.'\n\n 4. \nThe burden of proving the reasonableness of the fire clause, and that plaintiff had a fair opportunity to refuse or accept it, rested upon the defendant.\nMessrs. W. S. Parkerson and B. K. Miller for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles P. Cocke, William Wirt Howe, Walker B. Spencer, and John F. Dillon for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is well settled that the carrier may limit his common-law liability. York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 18 L. ed. 170. But it is urged that the contract must be upon a consideration other than the mere transportation of the property, and an 'option \n\n[194 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n and opportunity must be given to the shipper to select under which, the common-law or limited liability, he will ship his goods.'\n If this means that a carrier must take no advantage of the shipper, or practice no deceit upon him, we agree. If it means that the alternative must be actually presented to the shipper by the carrier, we cannot agree. From the standpoint of the law the relation between carrier and shipper is simple. Primarily the carrier's responsibility is that expressed in the common law, and the shipper may insist upon the responsibility. But he may consent to a limitation of it, and this is the 'option and opportunity' which is offered to him. What other can be necessary? There can be no limitation of liability without the assent of the shipper (New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 12 L. ed. 465), and there can be no stipulation for any exemption by a carrier which is not just and reasonable in the eye of the law. New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. ed. 627; Bank of Kentucky v. Adams, \n93 U.S. 174\n, 23 L. ed. 872.\n Inside of that limitation, the carrier may modify his responsibility by special contract with a shipper. A bill of lading limiting liability constitutes such a contract, and knowledge of the contents by the shipper will be presumed.\n\n\n (2)\n It is again urged that there was no independent consideration for the exemption expressed in the bill of lading. This point was made in York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 18 L. ed. 170. In response it was said: 'The second position is answered by the fact that there is no evidence that a consideration was not given for the stipulation. The company, probably, had rates of charges proportioned to the risks they assumed from the nature of the goods carried, and the exception of losses by fire must necessarily have affected the compensation demanded. Be this as it may, the consideration expressed was sufficient to support the entire contract made.'\n In other words, the consideration expressed in the bill of lading was sufficient to support its stipulations. This effect is not averted by showing that the defendant had only one \n\n[194 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n rate. It was the rate also of all other roads, and presumably it was adopted and offered to shippers in view of the limitation of the common- law liability of the roads.\n\n\n (3)\n The carrier cannot contract against the effect of his negligence, and hence it is contended that in the case at bar the burden of proof is upon the defendant to show that the fire was not caused by its negligence or that of its servants. The contention is answered by Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 13 L. ed. 985. In that case the bill of lading bound the carrier to deliver the goods in like good order in which they were received, dangers and accident of the seas and navigation excepted. It was held that after the damage to the goods had been established, the burden lay upon the carrier to show that it was caused by one of the perils from which the bill of lading exempted the carrier. But it was also held that even if the damage so occurred, yet, if it might have been avoided by skill and diligence at the time, the carrier was liable. 'But,' it was observed, 'in this stage and posture of the case the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish the negligence, as the affirmative lies upon him.' The doctrine was affirmed in Western Transp. Co. v. Downer, 11 Wall. 129, 20 L. ed. 160. See also  218, 2 Greenleaf on Evidence.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL STOCK YARDS CO v. LOUISVILLE & N R CO(1904)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph C. Dodd, William D. Washburn, W. M. Smith, and John L. Dodd for appellant.\n Messrs. Helm Bruce, Charles N. Burch Ed. Baxter, Gibson, Marshall, & Gibson, and Helm, Bruce, & Helm for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the circuit court of appeals affirming a decree of the circuit court which dismissed the plaintiff's bill. (55 C. C. A. 63, 118 Fid. 113.) The bill was brought by the appellant, a Delaware corporation, against a Kentucky corporation, to compel it to receive live stock tendered to it outside the state of Kentucky for the Central Stock Yards \n\n[192 U.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n station, and to deliver the same at a point of physical connection between its road and the Southern Railway, for ultimate delivery to or at the Central Stock Yards. The Central Stock Yards station is at the Central Stock Yards, just outside the boundary line of Louisville, Kentucky, on the Southern Railway Company's line, and by agreement between the two companies the Central Stock Yards are the 'live stock depot for the purpose of handling live stock to and from Louisville' on the Southern Railway. The defendant, by a similar arrangement, has made the Bourbon Stock Yards its live stock depot for Louisville, and declines to receive live stock billed to the Central Stock Yards, or to deliver live stock destined to Louisville elsewhere than at the Bourbon yards. There are physical connections bwtween the Louisville & Nashville and the Southern tracks at a point between the two stock yards, which is passed by the greater portion of the live stock carried by the Louisville & Nashville Company, and at another point which would be more convenient for delivery a little further to the northward. The details are unimportant, except that in order to deliver, as prayed, the defendant would be compelled either to build chutes or to hand over its cars to the Southern Railroad, after having made some contract for their return. The right is claimed by the plaintiff, under the Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, chap. 104  3, 24 Stat. at L. 379 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3155), making it unlawful for common carriers subject to the act to give unreasonable preferences, and requiring them to afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of property to and from their several lines and those connecting therewith. The right is claimed also under the Constitution of Kentucky, especially  213, requiring Kentucky railroad companies to receive, deliver, transfer, and transport freight from and to any point where there is a physical connection between the tracks, as we understand it, of the railroad concerned and any other.\n For the purposes of decision we assume, without expressing an opinion, that if the act of Congress and the Kentucky Constitution apply to the case, they both confer rights upon \n\n[192 U.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff. As to the former, compare  8, 9, and the act of February 19, 1903, chap. 708,  2, 32 Stat at L. 847, 848; Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 U.S. 128\n, 35 L. ed. 73, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461; Kentucky & I. Bridge Co. v. Louisville & N. R. Co. 2 L. R. A. 289, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 351, 37 Fed. 567, 610, 620. The rights under the latter which are relied upon especially could not be established without discussion. Compare Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks Co. L. R. 2 Exch. Div. 441; Johnston v. Consumers' Gas Co. \n\n[192 U.S. 568, 1898]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 447. For the same purpose we further assume that such rights as the plaintiff has may be enforced by bill in equity. See Interstate Stock-Yards Co. v. Indianapolis U. R. Co. 99 Fed. 472. We also lay on one side the question whether the section of the Constitution of Kentucky is or is not invalid as an attempt to regulate commerce among the states. For we are of opinion that the defendant's conduct is not within the prohibitions or requirements of either the act of Congress or the Constitution of Kentucky, as those provisions fairly should be construed.\n The Bourbon Stock Yards are the defendant's depot. They are its depot none the less that they are so by contract, and not by virtue of a title in fee. Unless a preference of its own depot to that of another road is forbidden, the defendant is not within the act of Congress. Suppose that the Southern Railway station and the Louisville & Nashville station were side by side, and that their tracks were connected within or just outside the limits of the station grounds. It could not be said that the defendant was giving an undue or unreasonable preference to itself or subjecting its neighbor to an undue or unreasonable disadvantage if it insisted on delivering live stock which it had carried to the end of the transit at its own yard. These views are sanctioned by what was said in Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 U.S. 128\n, 35 L. ed. 73, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461. The fact that the plaintiff's stock yards are public does not change the case. See further Butchers' & D. Stock-Yards Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. co. 14 C. C. A. 290, 31 U. S. App. 252, 67 Fed. 35.\n If the cattle are to be unloaded, then, as was said in Covington Stock-Yards co. v. Keith, the defendant has a right to unload them where its appliances for unloading are, and \n\n[192 U.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n cannot be required to establish another set hard by. On the other hand, if the cattle are to remain in the defendants' cars it cannot be required to hand those cars over to another railroad without a contract, and the courts have no authority to dictate a contract to the defendant or to require it to make one.

All that was decided in Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115, was that by statute two railroad companies might be required to make track connections. So much of the statute as undertook to regulate rates was not passed upon. See Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n186 \nU.S. 257, 263\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1151, 1156, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900. There is no act of Congress that attempts to give courts the power to require contracts to be made in a case like this.\n What we have said applies, in our opinion, to the Constitution of Kentucky with tittle additional argument. The requirement to deliver, transfer, and transport freight to any point where there is a physical connection between the tracks of the railroad companies, must be taken to refer to cases where the freight is destined to some further point by transportation over a connecting line. It cannot be intended to sanction the snatching of the freight from the transporting company at the moment and for the purpose of delivery. It seems to us that this would be so unreasonable an interpretation of the section that we do not find it necessary to consider whether, under any interpretation, it can be sustained. In view of the course taken by the argument we may add that we do \n\n[192 U.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n not find a requirement that the railroad company shall deliver its own cars to another road. The earlier part of  213 provides that all railroads 'shall receive, transfer, deliver, and switch empty or loaded cars, and shall move, transport, receive, load, or unload all the freight in carloads or less quantities, coming to or going from any railroad, . . . with equal promptness and dispatch, and without any discrimination. . . .' Promptness and the absence of discrimination are the point, and that shows that the words 'coming to or going from any railroad,' qualify the words 'empty or loaded cars' as well as 'freight,' and therefore that the cars referred to are cars from other roads. The same thing is shown by the word 'receive,' which is the startingpoint of all that relates to cars. See Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Com. 108 Ky. 628, 633, 57 S. W. 508. The other sections of the Constitution need no special remark.\n We have discussed the case as if the two stock yards were side by side. They were not, but they both were points of delivery for cattle having Louisville as their general destination. They both were Louisville stations in effect. I may be that a case could be imagined in which carriage to another station in the same city by another road fairly might be regarded as bona fide further transportation over a connecting road and within the requirements of the Kentucky Constitution. However that may be, we are of opinion that the court below was entirely right, so far as appears, in treating this as an ordinary case of stations at substantially the same point of delivery, and, therefore, as one to be dealt with as if they were side by side. As the defendant would not be bound to deliver at the CentralStock Yards if they were by the side of its track, its obligation is no greater because of the intervention of a short piece of the track of another railroad. As we have said, the delivery would have to be made either by unloading or by the surrender of the defendants' cars.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justic McKenna concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHANDLER v. DIX(1904)\nNo. 261\nArgued: April 28, 1904Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. John A. McKay and George W. Weadock for appellant.\n Messrs. John H. Goff, Charles A. Blair, and Henry E. Chase for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This bill is not artificially drawn, but we take it to be primarily, at least, a bill to remove a cloud upon the plaintiff's title to certain lands which have been sold for taxes, brought upon the ground that the tax laws of Michigan, for a series of years named, were unconstitutional, and deprived the plaintiff of his property contrary to the 14th Amendment. The circuit court dismissed the bill on demurrer, and the plaintiff \n\n[194 U.S. 590, 591]\n\u00a0\n appealed. The dismissal was so plainly right that it is less necessary than otherwise it might be to pick out and analyze the meagre allegations of fact from the much more lengthy suggestions and argnments of matter of law. It is to be gathered that all of the lands referred to have been sold, and that in some, if not all, cases, the state was the purchaser, under the state laws. It does not appear that the state has sold to any one else, or that, if it has, the purchaser is a party to the bill. It does appear that the state claims title and, it would seem, possession of a large part, if not all, of the lands. It does not appear by sufficient allegations that any defendant claims either possession or title.\n It is obvious, without going further, that the bill cannot be maintained. The auditor general and county treasurer claim no interest in the land, and have none in the question whether the state's title is good. The state's title, so far as appears, is the only one assailed. The state, therefore, is a necessary party (Burrill v. Auditor General, 46 Mich. 256, 9 N. W. 273); and, as this suit cannot be maintained against a state, the bill, so far as it seeks to have tax sales declared void, must be dismissed, whether it be admitted that Michigan is not represented, or be said that it is represented by the auditor general. The plaintiff relies upon the Public Acts of Michigan, 1899, act 97, adding  144 to the general tax law of 1893. That act provides that 'the auditor general shall be made a party defendant to all actions or proceedings instituted for the purpose of setting aside any sale or sales for delinquent taxes on lands held as state tax lands, or which have been sold as such, or which have been sold at annual tax sales, or for purpose of setting aside any taxes returned to him and for which sale has not been made.' But we are of opinion that if the foregoing words otherwise would apply to this case, they should not be construed as expressing a waiver by the state of its constitutional immunity from suit in a United States court. The provisions indicate that the legislature had in mind only proceedings in the courts of the state. A copy of the com- \n\n[194 U.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n plaint is to be served upon the prosecuting attorney, who is to send a copy thereof within five days to the auditor general, and this is to be in lieu of service of process. It then is left to the discretion of the auditor general to cause the attorney general to represent him, and it is provided that in such suits no costs shall be taxed. These provisions with regard to procedure and costs show that the statute is dealing with a matter supposed to remain under state control. Of course, a taxpayer denied rights secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and specially set up by him, could bring the case here by writ of error from the highest courts of the state. But the statute does not warrant the beginning of a suit in the Federal court to set aside the title of the state. Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436, 445\n, 44 S. L. ed. 1140, 1145, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 919.\n It is true that the statute deals also with suits for setting aside taxes for which sales have not been made, and that apart from the statute, injunctions against officers proceeding unconstitutionally, under color of their office, are well known. Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 U.S. 1\n, 35 L. ed. 363, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699; Fargo v. Hart, decided at this term (\n193 U.S. 490\n, ante, p. 498, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498). It is true, also, that while the prayers of the bill are directed mainly to the setting aside of conveyances supposed to have been made before the filing of the bill, there is also a prayer that the defendants be enjoined from levying taxes on the lands, from selling them, or from taking further proceedings under the said laws. It seems to be the practice in Michigan to continue to assess lands sold for taxes while in the hands of the state, for reasons which are easily understood, but do not need to be explained. It is unnecessary to consider whether an injunction could be granted against this without disposing of the title alleged by the state, or whether sufficient foundation is laid for the prayer in the vague allegations of the bill. It is enough to say that, as the defendant Dix has retired from office, the bill must be dismissed. It does not appear upon the record that any amendment was sought to be made, or that, if one had been offered, it could have been allowed. Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, 165 \n\n[194 U.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 28, 41 L. ed. 621, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225. The case was disposed of properly by the circuit court on the foregoing grounds. Therefore, the merits cannot be discussed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARNOCK v. TEXAS & P R CO(1904)\nNo. 194\nArgued: April 8, 1904Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William S. Parkerson and Branch K. Miller for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles P. Coc ke, William Wirt Howe, W. B. Spencer, and John F. Dillon for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case was removed from the civil district court in and for the parish of Orleans to the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Louisiana by defendant, on the ground that it was a corporation organized by an act of Congress of the United States.\n The petition alleges that plaintiff delivered to defendant, at a point on the line of its railway called Meekers' Switch, to be transported to New Orleans, 52 bales of cotton at a rate of freight then and there agreed upon, and a bill of lading issued to plaintiff. The cotton was loaded upon the cars of defendant, and, while waiting transportation, was destroyed by fire.\n The petition charges negligence on the part of defendant in that it failed to take measures of precaution for the safety and protection of the cotton, but left it in the cars on a side track, 'in an open country, unguarded and unwatched.' The bill of lading contained a provision exempting defendant from liability for damage to, or destruction of, the cotton by fire, but the petition alleges that the provision was null and void, as far as plaintiff is concerned, for the following reasons, among others: He received no consideration therefor; the rate which he agreed to pay was the only rate defendant would give or was offered; on account of the negligence of the defendant.\n The value of the cotton was $2,440.32.\n The evidence in the case is that Meekers was a mere switch track running to the Meekers plantation. No agent was maintained at the station. Shippers wanting cars applied for them at the next station. The practice was for shippers to load the cars furnished and to get bills of lading from the agent who furnished the cars. The next train passing after the cars were \n\n[194 U.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n loaded took them; that no guard or watchman was placed over freight was well known.\n The loading of the cotton in the present case was completed at 2 P. M. The bill of lading was obtained at 5 P. M. The fire was discovered at 10 P. M. The train which was to take the cars was not due until 9 A. M. next morning. There was no evidence of the cause of the fire.\n Defendant moved the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict for it. Plaintiff requested the court to submit to the jury the question whether or not the destruction of the cotton was due to, or caused by, the negligence of the defendant. The request was denied, and the motion of the defendant was granted, and a verdict was returned for defendant. From the judgment entered on the verdict error was prosecuted to the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, and the judgment was affirmed. 51 C. C. A. 78, 113 Fed. 92.\n This case was argued and submitted with Cau v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n194 U.S. 427\n, ante, 663, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663, and all of its questions are ruled by that case except one, and that is the effect of leaving the cotton unguarded on the responsibility of the defendant.\n In answering the question two elements are to be considered,-the negligence of the defendant, and its connection with the destruction of the cotton. If the evidence established neither, the circuit court rightfully directed a verdict for defendant.\n Negligence has always relation to the circumstances in which one is placed, and what an ordinarily prudent man would do or omit in such circumstances. Applying that test in the case at bar, we do not think negligence on the part of defendant was established.\n Meekers was not a regular station; indeed, was not a station at all, but a mere switch track. The defendant was not obliged to receive freight there. It was, as said by the court of appeals, 'a country or plantation switch,' established and maintained for the accommodation of the planters of the neighborhood. There was no agent or employee maintained there for the purpose of receiving or guarding freight, nor was there fire \n\n[194 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n apparatus kept. Cars were only sent there when ordered, loaded by the shipper, and taken by the first passing freight train to the point of destination. This was the practice for years, and there is not a word of testimony that it was not adequate to the protection of the planters, as it was to their accommodation, or that it was, in their judgment, not a complete fulfilment of the duty of defendant. No circumstance is shown which demanded a change in the practice. There was no demand made by the plaintiff for a change. Whatever risk there was seems to have been accepted as a consideration for the convenience afforded. It is easy to understand that if watchmen had been demanded of the defendant, it would have insisted upon the delivery of freight at its regular station at Le Compte, 2 1\/2 miles distant. But the risk seems not to have been great. No loss from any cause is shown to have occurred during the existence of the practice,-nothing shown from which danger could be apprehended. One of the plaintiff's witnesses testified that tramps passed up and down the road daily; but what can be inferred from that? It is inappreciable. Was danger to be apprehended from their carelessness or malice? During the ten or eleven years of the existence of the station not an instance of either is shown.\n It is, however, urged that a place of delivery other than a regular station can be agreed on or established by custom or practice, and at the instant of delivery the full responsibility of a carrier attaches. To bring the case at bar within those principles-Fisher v. The Norval, 8 Mart. N. S. 120; Barrett v. Salter, 10 Rob. (La.) 434, and Roth v. Harkson, 18 La. Ann. 705, are cited. The principles may be assented to; the cases cited are distinguishable from that at bar.\n In Fisher v. The Norval, 35 bales of cotton were sent to be shipped on the brig Norval, and were received by the captain. The cotton was left upon the levee, unguarded, and during the night following delivery it was destroyed by fire. The origin of the fire was not shown, but it was shown \n\n[194 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n that it was not customary in the city (New Orleans) to put a guard over cotton so placed. The Code of the state made carriers liable for loss or damage to property intrusted to their care, unless they proved that such loss or damage had been occasioned by accidental and uncontrollable events. The defendants in the case were adjudged liable. The supreme court held, approving the decision of the trial court, 'there was negligence in the defendants permitting the cotton to be exposed all night on the levee, to theft, fire, and other accidents, without some person to take care of it.' It was not the care, the court further observed, that a prudent person would take of his own property, and the custom proved was not a good excuse. The facts in that case are markedly different from those in the pending case. Cotton exposed upon the levees of New Orleans is in a different situation from cotton inclosed in locked box cars on a side track, in the solitude of the country, and demands a different degree of care.\n In Barrett v. Salter, 40 hogsheads of tobacco were delivered for shipment on the ship Huron. It was receipted for by the After it was received a heavy rain came, which lasted about two hours, to which it was suffered to remain exposed. It was testified that the captain was told that if the tobacco should be put on board without being opened and trimmed, it would be found damaged on its arrival at destination. It was so found. The defendants were held liable.\n In Roth v. Harkson, the question was whether cotton put in a place designated by a mate of a ship, and covered by a tarpaulin, by the direction of the officers of the ship, was delivered to the ship, notwithstanding the officers afterwards refused to receipt for it on the ground of the lateness of the hour. It was held to be a delivery.\n The question in the case at bar, however, is not whether there was delivery to defendant, nor when its responsibility attached, but assuming delivery at Meekers, and that defendant's responsibility attached at the time the bills of lading were issued, was defendant guilty of negligence? That ques- \n\n[194 U.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n tion we have answered in the negative; nor could the answer be otherwise, even if it be conceded, as contended by plaintiff, that under the law of Louisiana the burden of proof was upon the defendant to show the absence of negligence. The allegation of the petition was: 'That the fire, by which the destruction of said cotton was caused, was due to the negligence of the said company itself, and of its agents, employees and servants; that the said cotton way by it left in two cars of the said company, standing upon its track, in the open country, unguarded and unwatched by the said company, in any particular whatsoever; that it was the duty of the said company to take some measures of precaution to protect said cars and the cotton contained therein, from depredation, loss, or injury by third persons, wrongdoers or those bent upon mischief; that it totally failed and neglected to take any measures of precaution for the safety and protection of the said cotton, but left it in said cars, said track, unguarded and unwatched, in the nighttime, during which it was destroyed by fire; that petitioner believes that the said cotton was set on fire by some malicious person; that petitioner has no actual knowledge as to the origin or cause of said fire.' The evidence we have commented on, and, we may only add, it established all that was charged as negligence, and there was nothing for the defendant to explain. The defendant could, as it did, submit the question of its liability upon the evidence adduced. Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESEBROUGH v. U S(1904)\nNo. 152\nArgued: Decided: January 25, 1904\n\n\n\n Robert A. Chesebrough filed his petition in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, May 23, 1902, to recover the sum of $600 from the United States, alleged to have been paid to the collector of internal revenue for the second district of New York for the purchase of certain internal revenue stamps to be affixed to a deed for the conveyance of real estate. Petitioner alleged that on May 28, 1900, he entered into an agreement with the Chesebrough Building Company to convey to that corporation certain real estate which he then owned, and to execute and deliver a deed therefor on the 5th day of June, 1900. That on that day he made, executed, and delivered to the corporation a deed of conveyance of the real estate, and received the con- \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n sideration therefor. That at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed the act of Congress of June 13, 1898, 'to provide ways and means to meet war expenditures, and for other purposes,' was in force, which provided in part as follows:\n'Sec. 6. That on and after the first day of July, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, there shall be levied, collected, and paid, for and in respect of the several bonds, debentures, or certificates of stock and of indebtedness, and other documents, instruments, matters, and things mentioned and described in Schedule A of this act, or for or in respect of the vellum, parchment, or paper upon which such instruments, matters, or things, or any of them, shall be written or printed by any person or persons, or party who shall make, sign, or issue the same, or for whose use or benefit the same shall be made, signed, or issued, the several taxes or sums of money set down in figures against the same, respectively, or otherwise specified or set forth in the said schedule.'\n\n'Schedule A.\n\n'Conveyance: Deed, instrument, or writing, whereby any lands, tenements, or other realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the purchaser or purchasers, or any other person or persons, by his, her, or their direction, when the consideration or value exceeds one hundred dollars and does not exceed five hundred dollars, fifty cents; and for each additional five hundred dollars or fractional part thereof in excess of five hundred dollars, fifty cents.'\n\n'Sec. 7. That if any person or persons shall make, sign, or issue, or cause to be made, signed, or issued, any instrument, document, or paper of any kind or description whatsoever, without the same being duly stamped for denoting the tax hereby imposed thereon, or without having thereupon an adhesive stamp to denote said tax, such person or persons shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall pay a fine of not more than one hundred dollars, at the discretion of the court, and such instrument, document, \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n or paper, as aforesaid, shall not be competent evidence in any court.' [30 Stat. at L. 451, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2290.]\n\n The petition then averred that 'the Chesebrough Building Company, as was known to petitioner, was unwilling to accept the said deed of conveyance unless and until the petitioner had placed thereon the stamps required by the aforesaid act, and that petitioner, under compulsion of said law, and in order to receive from the purchaser the shares of stock named as the consideration for such conveyance, and in order to untitle such deed to be recorded under the provisions of said act, and to be received as evidence in the Federal courts, as therein provided, and in order to enable the petitioner to fulfil his aforesaid contract with said Chesebrough Building Company to make, execute, and deliver to said company a good and sufficient deed of conveyance of said real estate and premises, and in order to give to said company a good and clear title to said real estate and premises, free from doubt, did purchase from Charles H. Treat, the United States collector of internal revenue for the second district of New York, and place upon the said deed of conveyance, stamps to the amount of six hundred dollars ($600) the proceeds of sale of which stamps your petitioner believes were thereupon by said collector paid over to the United States as required by law, and said moneys are now held by the United States.'\n It was further averred that prior to the institution of the action, and in pursuance of the laws of the United States and the regulations of the Treasury Department in that behalf, petitioner made a written application on January 9, 1902, to the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the refunding of the amount so paid by him for stamps as aforesaid, which application was denied. Petitioner then charged that the act was unconstitutional and void, and prayed judgment. To this petition a demurrer was filed on behalf of the United States, assigning the ground that the petition did 'not state facts which would constitute a claim on the part of the claimant against the United States.' The demurrer was sus- \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n tained and the petition dismissed, and this writ of error was thereupon allowed.\n Sections 3220, 3226, 3227, and 3228 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2086, 2088, 2089) are as follows:\n'Sec. 3320. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized, on appeal to him made, to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, all penalties collected without authority, and all taxes that appear to be unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in any manner wrongfully collected; also to repay to any collector or deputy collector the full amount of such sums of money as may be recovered against him in any court, for any internal taxes collected by him, with the costs and expenses of suit; also all damages and costs recovered against any assessor, assistant assessor, collector, deputy collector, or inspector, in any suit brought against him by reason of anything done in the due performance of his official duty: Provided, That where a second assessment is made in case of a list, statement, or return which, in the opinion of the collector or deputy collector, was false or fraudulent, or contained any understatement or undervaluation, such assessment shall not be remitted, nor shall taxes collected under such assessment be refunded, or paid back, unless it is proved that said list, statement, or return was not false or fraudulent, and did not contain any understatement or undervaluation.'\n\n'Sec. 3226. No suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of [the] Internal Revenue, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof, and a decision of the Commissioner has been had therein: Provided, That if such decision \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n is delayed more than six months from the date of such appeal, then the said suit may be brought, without first having a decision of the Commissioner, at any time within the period limited in the next section.\n\n'Sec. 3227. No suit or proceeding for the recovery of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty alleged to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, shall be maintained in any court, unless the same is brought within two years next after the cause of action accrued: Provided, That actions for such claims which accrued prior to June six, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, may be brought within one year from said date; and that where any such claim was pending before the Commissioner, as provided in the preceding section, an action thereon may be brought within one year after such decision and not after. But no right of action which was already barred by any statute on the said date shall be revived by this section.\n\n'Sec. 3228. All claims for the refunding of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty alleged to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, must be presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue within two years next after the cause of action accrued: Provided, That claims which accrued prior to June six, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, may be presented to the Commissioner at any time within one year from said date. But nothing in this section shall be construed to revive any right of action which was already barred by any statute on that date.'\n\n Messrs. Frederic R. Coudert, Jr., Paul Fuller, and Henry M. Ward for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\nMr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The rule is firmly established that taxes voluntarily paid cannot be recovered back, and payments with knowledge and without compulsion are voluntary. At the same time, when taxes are paid under protest that they are being illegally exacted, or with notice that the payer contends that they are illegal, and intends to institute suit to compel their repayment, a recovery in such a suit may, on occasion, be had, although generally speaking, even a protest or notice will not avail if the payment be made voluntarily, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, and without any coercion by the actual or threatened exercise of power possessed, or supposed to be possessed, by the party exacting or receiving the payment, over the person or property of the party making the payment, from which the latter has no other means of imme- \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n diate relief than such payment. Little v. Bowers, \n134 \nU.S. 547, 554\n, 33 S. L. ed. 1016, 1019, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620; Union P. R. Co. v. Dodge County, \n98 \nU.S. 541, 544\n, 25 S. L. ed. 196, 197; Radich v. Hutchins, \n95 U.S. 210\n, 24 L. ed. 409, citing Brumagin v. Tillinghasl, 18 Cal. 265, 79 Am. Dec. 176, a case in respect of stamps purchased, in which the subject is discussed by Mr. Justice Field, then chief justice of California.\n In Union P. R. Co. v. Dodge County, Mr. Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the court, said:\n'There are, no doubt, cases to be found in which the language of the court, if separated from the facts of the particular case under consideration, would seem to imply that a protest alone was sufficient to show that the payment was not voluntary; but on examination it will be found that the protest was used to give effect to the other attending circumstances. Thus, in Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 9 L. ed. 373, and Bend v. Hoyt, 13 Pet. 266, 10 L. ed. 155, which were customs cases, the payments were made to release goods held for duties on imports; and the protest became necessary, in order to show that the legality of the demand was not admitted when the payment was made. The recovery rested upon the fact that the payment was made to release property from detention, and the protest saved the rights which grew out of that fact. In Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 730, 18 L. ed. 616, and The Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 13, 20 L. ed. 276, which were internal revenue tax cases, the actions were sustained 'upon the ground that the several provisions in the internal revenue acts referred to warranted the conclusion as a necessary implication that Congress intended to give the taxpayer such remedy.' It is so expressly stated in the last case, p. 14, L. ed. 276. As the case of Erskine v. Van Arsdale, 15 Wall. 75, 21 L. ed. 63, followed these, and was of the same general character, it is to be presumed that it was put upon the same ground. In such cases the protest plays the same part it does in customs cases, and gives notice that the payment is not to be considered as admitting the right to make the demand.'\n\n The stamps in question were purchased from the collector of internal revenue for the second district of New York, for the \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n purpose of affixing them to a deed of conveyance to the building company, but the collector was not informed at the time of the purchase of the particular purpose, and no intimation was given him, written or oral, that petitioner claimed that the law requiring such stamps was unconstitutional, and that he was making the purchase under duress. The petition did allege that the building company was unwilling to accept an unstamped conveyance, and that the stamps were thereupon affixed in order to complete the transaction and obtain the consideration, but if that constituted duress as between Chesebrough and his building company it was a matter with which the collector had nothing to do. On the face of the petition the purchase was purely voluntary and made under mutual mistake of law if the law were unconstitutional. But it is said that protest or notice would have made this payment involuntary, and that because something over nineteen months after the payment petitioner made 'a written application' to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the amount he had paid for the stamps, the ordinary rule did not apply, inasmuch as such an application was 'the statutory equivalent of a common law protest or notice of suit.'\n The reference is to  3220 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on appeal to him, may remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or that appear to have been unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in any manner wrongfully collected; and also 'repay to any collector or deputy collector the full amount of such sums of money as may be recovered against him in any court, for any internal taxes collected by him, with the cost and expenses of suit;' while  3226, 3227, and 3228 provide that no suit shall be maintained for the recovery of internal taxes alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected 'until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue;' or unless brought within two years after the cause \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n of action accrued; and that the claim for refunding shall be presented to the Commissioner within two years.\n The words 'until appeal shall have been duly made,' appear to us to imply an adverse decision by the collector, at least a compelled payment, or official demand for payment, from which the appeal is taken.\n In Stewart v. Barnes, \n153 U.S. 456\n, 38 L. ed. 781, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 849, this court treated the language as providing for 'an appeal,' and we think correctly. The opinion considered  19 of the act of July 13, 1866, 14 Stat. at L. 152, chap. 184 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2088), carried forward into  3226, and  44 of the act of June 6, 1872, 17 Stat. at L. 257, chap. 315 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2089), from which  3227 and 3228 were drawn. We give them in the margin. \n Sec. 19, Act of July 13, 1866:\n'Sec. 19. And be it further enacted, That no suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof, and a decision of said Commissioner shall be had thereon, unless such suit shall be brought within six months from the time of said decision, or within six months from the time this act takes effect: Provided, That if said decision shall be delayed more than six months from the date of such appeal, then said suit may be brought at any time within twelve months from the date of such appeal.'\n\n Sec. 44, Act of June 6, 1872:\n'Sec. 44. That all suits and proceedings for the recovery of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or for any sum which it is alleged was excessive, or in any manner wrongfully collected, shall be brought within two years next after the cause of action accrued, and not after; and all claims for the refunding of any internal tax or penalty shall be presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue within two years next after the cause of action accrued, and not after: Provided, That actions for claims which have accrued prior to the passage of this act shall be commenced in the courts or presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue within one year from the date of said passage: And provided further, That where a claim shall be pending before said Commissioner the claimant may bring his action within one year after such decision, and not after: And provided further, That no right of action barred by any statute now in force shall be revived by anything herein contained.' \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n This petition did not set up any ruling of the collector, either specific or resulting from a demand to which petitioner yielded under protest or with notice, and from which he appealed to the Commissioner, but averred that he 'made a written application' to the Commissioner to refund the amount he had paid.\n\n We do not say that this was not sufficient to justify action by the Commissioner, but the averment as it stands is not equivalent to stating a previous adverse decision appealed from. The inference is that the application was a mere afterthought, and if an afterthought, the payment was voluntary.\n The Commissioner might nevertheless have allowed the claim, and doubtless would have done so, in the interest of justice, if there were no particular circumstances to discredit it, and the law had been held unconstitutional by this court. But he rejected it, and petitioner was remitted to his suit in no different plight, so far as his cause of action was concerned, that if he had not sought the Commissioner at all.\n In United States v. Real Estate Sav. Bank, \n104 U.S. 728\n, 26 L. ed. 908, it was held that the allowance of a claim by the Commissioner was equivalent to an account stated between private parties, and binding on the United States until impeached for fraud or mistake, and that if not paid on proper application through the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, an action might be maintained on it in the court of claims; while if the claim were rejected, an action might be prosecuted against the collector. It was not, however, ruled that in the latter situation a recovery could be had if the original payment had been voluntary and without objection.\n It is one thing for the government to correct mistakes, return overcharges, or refund amounts exacted without authority, when satisfied such action is due to justice, and quite another thing for the government to be compelled to repay amounts which, in its view, have been lawfully collected.\n By  3220 authority is given and opportunity afforded to do what justice and right are found to require, and the conditions which govern contested litigation may well be regarded \n\n[192 U.S. 253, 264]\n\u00a0\n as waived; but it does not follow that there is any statutory waiver of such conditions when the government is proceeded against in invitum.\n As we have said, the purchase of these stamps was purely voluntary, and if, notwithstanding, recovery could be had, it could only be on protest or notice, and there was none such here, written or verbal, formal or informal.\n It is argued that the provision of  3220 for the repayment of judgments against the collector rendered protest or notice unnecessary for his protection; but it was clearly demanded for the protection of the government in conducting the extensive business of dealing in stamps, which were sold and delivered in quantities, and without it there would not be the slightest vestige of involuntary payment in transactions like that under consideration. And we find no right of recovery, expressly or by necessary implication, conferred by statute, in such circumstances.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCINCINNATI ST RY CO v. SNELL(1904)\nNo. 124\nArgued: January 14, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. John W. Warrington and E. W. Kittredge for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Wolfe and Thomas L. Michie for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Snell, the defendant in error, sued the railway company, the plaintiff in error, in the common pleas court of Hamilton \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n county, Ohio, to recover for alleged personal injuries. Availing of a section of the Ohio statutes, Snell moved that the cause be transferred for trial to the court of common pleas of an adjoining county, and reserved an exception to a denial of such request. The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the railway company.\n Error was prosecuted by Snell to the circuit court of Hamilton county, and the judgment being affirmed in that court the case was taken to the supreme court of Ohio. The error complained of was the refusal of the trial court to grant a transfer of the cause. The railway company insisted in both courts that the transfer had been rightly refused on technical grounds, and because the state statute upon which the transfer was asked was repugnant to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The supreme court of Ohio decided that under the state statute the court should have transferred the cause, and that the statute which required this transfer was not repugnant to the 14th Amendment. 60 Ohio St. 256, 54 N. E. 270. The case was then brought to this court by the railway company and was dismissed because the judgment of the supreme court of the state was not final. Cincinnati Street R. Co. v. Snell, \n179 U.S. 395\n, 45 L. ed. 248, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205. The cause thereupon proceeded in the state court and was transferred from Hamilton county to the common pleas court of an adjoining county, where a trial was had which resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of Snell. The railway company prosecuted error to the circuit court of the county, and, failing to secure a reversal in that tribunal, carried the case to the supreme court of Ohio, by which court the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. In all the courts the railway company reiterated its contention concerning the repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States of the statute providing for the transfer of the cause, and its claims on this subject were expressly overruled. This writ of error was thereupon allowed.\n Section 5030 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, upon which the application for the transfer of the cause was allowed, is as follows: \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n 'When a corporation having more than fifty stockholders is a party in an action pending in a county in which the corporation keeps its principal office, or transacts its principal business, if the opposite party make affidavit that he cannot, as he believes, have a fair and impartial trial in that county, and his application is sustained by the several affidavits of five credible persons residing in such county, the court shall change the venue to the adjoining county most convenient for both parties.'\n The supreme court of Ohio, in disposing of the objection that the statute was repugnant to the equal protection and the due process clauses of the 14th Amendment, among other things, said:\n'We are unable to adopt that view. It has never been regarded as essential to the validity of remedial procedure that it should be applicable in all of its provisions to all persons or parties alike. Different situations and conditions often render appropriate and necessary different provisions, the necessity of propriety of which rests largely in the legislative discretion.\n\n ... * *\n'Generally, actions against individuals must be brought in the county where the defendant resides or may be personally served with process; and generally, actions against corporations are required to be brought in the county in which the corporation is situate, or has its principal office or place of business, or and office or agent; while insurance companies may be sued in any county where the cause of action or any part of it arose, a mining corporation in any county in which it owns or operates a mine, and a railroad company in any county into which the road runs. Of a like nature are regulations for changes of venue. They are designed to secure to parties a fair and impartial trial of their causes, which is the ultimate and highest purpose of judicial proceedings; and the extent to which such regulations may go, for the accomplishment of that purpose, is addressed to a sound legislative discretion, in view of the nature of the case to be provided for, and the probable conditions likely to arise.'\n\n And in further commenting upon the effect of the remedy \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n which the statute afforded upon the substantial rights of the parties, the court observed:\n'In neither case, however, is any party deprived of the equal protection of the law, for each is assured of a fair trial, with equal opportunities to establish and enforce his rights; nor is the remedy by due course of law denied, because in the forum to which the cause is removed, the trial is conducted in the same way, under the same mode of procedure, as in that from which it was changed, with all remedial rights of the parties unimpaired. The only complaint is that the trial will be attended with some inconvenience and additional expense; but in that respect both parties are equally affected, and must necessarily be so in any change of venue for any cause; and the objection is, we think, insufficient to annul a statute, otherwise unobjectionable, which, in the legislative estimation, was demanded in order to secure the impartial administration of justice.'\n\n None of the errors assigned or arguments advanced to sustain them pretend that any unequal law governed the trial of the cause in the courts below or that the result of such trial was a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The sole contention is that the equal protection of the laws was denied because an equal opportunity was not afforded to secure a transfer of the cause from the court in which it was originally brought to the court in which it was ultimately tried.\n Thus, it is argued that the plaintiff Snell under the statute was given the right to have the cause transferred whilst a like right was not conferred on the corporation; that the existence of prejudice justifying the transfer was made by the statute to depend upon the domicil and number of stockholders in the corporation, while no equivalent right was given the corporation growing out of any prejudice which might have existed against the corporation, it being moreover asserted that the causes stated in the statute as basis for the transfer furnish no just ground for the classification made by the statute. The entire ground, therefore, relied on to show that the statute is repugnant to the 14th Amendment rests upon the assumption that such amendment not only secures that the \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n rights and obligations of persons shall be measured by equal laws, but also that the provisions of the Amendment control the states in the creation of courts and in the provisions made for the trial of causes in the courts which are created.\n This proposition, however, was long since decided to be untenable. Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, sub nom. Bowman v. Lewis, 25 L. ed. 989; Chappell Chemical & Fertilizer Co. v. Sulphur Mines Co. \n172 U.S. 474\n, 43 L. ed. 520, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. In the first of these cases it was directly held that the 14th Amendment did not operate to deprive the several states of the complete power to create such courts as were deemed essential, and to endow them with such jurisdiction as was considered appropriate. This being true, it follows, as the lesser is contained in the greater power, that the state law which authorized under enumerated circumstances and conditions the transfer of the cause from one court to another, was equally unaffected by the provisions of the 14th Amendment. But conceding, arguendo, the contrary, this case is without merit.\n As previously shown, the supreme court of the state of Ohio pointed out in its opinion that the rights of the parties were governed in the court to which the case was transferred by the same law and the same rules which would have prevailed had the case been tried in the court in which it was originally brought. And this has not been chalienged either by the assignments of error or any of the arguments made to sustain them. The proposition to which the case reduces itself is therefore this: That although the protection of equal laws equally administered has been enjoyed, nevertheless there has been a denial of the equal protection of the law within the purview of the 14th Amendment, only because the state has allowed one person to seek one forum and has not allowed another person, asserted to be in the same class, to seek the same forum, although as to both persons the law has afforded a forum in which the same and equal laws are applicable and administered. But it is fundamental rights which the 14th Amendment safeguards, and not the mere forum which a state may see proper to designate for the enforcement and protection of such rights. Given, therefore, a condition \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n where fundamental rights are equally protected and preserved, it is impossible to say that the rights which are thus protected and preserved have been denied because the state has deemed best to provide for a trial in one forum or another. It is not, under any view, the mere tribunal into which a person is authorized to proceed by a state which determines whether the equal protection of the law has been afforded, but whether in the tribunals which the state has provided equal laws prevail.\n It follows that the mere direction of the state law that a cause, under given circumstances, shall be tried in one forum instead of another, or may be transferred when brought from one forum to another, can have no tendency to violate the guaranty of the equal protection of the laws where in both the forums equality of law governs and equality of administration prevails. In Iowa C. R. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 U.S. 393\n, 40 L. ed. 469, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 360, this court said:\n'But it is clear that the 14th Amendment in no way undertakes to control the power of a state to determine by what process legal rights may be asserted or legal obligations be enforced, provided the method of procedure adopted for these purposes gives reasonable notice and affords fair opportunity to be heard before the issues are decided. This being the case, it was obviously not a right, privilege, or immunity of a citizen of the United States to have a controversy in the state court prosecuted or determined by one form of action instead of by another.'\n\n And the same principle was reiterated in Backus v. Ft. Street Union Depot Co. \n169 \nU.S. 557, 569\n, 42 S. L. ed. 853, 859, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 445, and in Wilson v. North Carolina, \n169 U.S. 586\n, 42 L. ed. 865, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 435. It was further expressed in Williams v. Eggleston, \n170 U.S. 304\n, 42 L. ed. 1047, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617, and in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 U.S. 230\n, 44 L. ed. 747, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620. The cases decided in this court, which are relied upon at bar to sustain the contrary contention, are not apposite. They are Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co. \n183 U.S. 79\n, 46 L. ed. 92, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30, and Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431. Each of these cases involved determining whether \n\n[193 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of particular state laws were so unequal in their operation upon the rights of parties as to engender the inequality prohibited by the 14th Amendment. None of the cases, therefore, lend support to the proposition upon which this case depends; that is, that, although there has been no denial of the equal protection of the laws, nevertheless such denial must be held to exist only because the state has seen fit to direct under particular conditions a trial of a cause in one forum instead of in another, when in both forums equal laws are applicable and an equal administration of justice obtained.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIZENS' BANK OF LOUISIANA v. PARKER(1904)\nNo. 150\nArgued: October 15, 1902Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 73, 74]\n\u00a0\n This suit was instituted in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans for the recovery of the sum of $2,400, claimed to be due from the bank for the year 1894 as a license tax for carrying on a banking business. The license is claimed to have been authorized by the following provision of act No. 150 of the general assembly of Louisiana of 1890: 'That for each business of carrying on a bank, banking company, association, corporation, or agency, the license shall be based on the declared or nominal capital and surplus, whether said capital and surplus is owned, or in use, or on deposit in the state or elsewhere, as follows, to wit: . . . Ninth class. When the said declared or nominal capital and surplus is four hundred thousand dollars or more, and under six hundred thousand dollars, the license shall be four hundred and fifty dollars ($ 450.)' [La. Rev. Laws, p. 835.]\n The bank pleaded the general issue and that it was exempt from paying such license by the provisions of its charter, granted in 1833, and by  4 of the act of January 30, 1836, amending the charter, by which it was provided that 'the capital of said bank shall be exempt from any tax laid by the state, or by any parish or body politic, under the authority of the state, during the continuance of its charter.' It was alleged that the charter of 1833 and the amendment of 1836 were granted for a valuable consideration, and constituted a contract between the state and the bank, and that the act imposing the license impaired the obligation of the contract, and was therefore violative of the Constitution of the United \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n States. Certain judgments were also pleaded as res judicata and introduced in evidence, one of which was the decree of this court in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 371\n, 42 L. ed. 202, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905.\n The trial court sustained the defense of the bank, based on its claim under its charter, but did not pass on the plea of res judicata. The court observed: 'I pass only on the main issue raised, without reference to the defendant's plea of res judicata. Inasmuch as it does not appear that the issue of exemption from a license tax has been presented in any of the cases and judgments relied on to support the plea.'\n Judgment was entered, dismissing the demand of the state. It was reversed on appeal to the supreme court, the court, however, dividing. 52 La. Ann. 1086, 27 So. 709. Elaborate opinions were delivered both by the majority and minority of the court. All of the contentions of the bank were held to be untenable, but the members of the majority did not agree upon the grounds. Mr. Justice Monroe, with whom concurred the Chief Justice, placed his decision on three grounds: (1) The plea of res judicata could not be sustained, because the validity of a license tax was not involved in the decrees or judgments pleaded. (2) License taxes were distinguishable from taxes on property, and the bank was not exempt from the former by its charter. (3) The act of 1874, extending the charter from 1884 to 1911, was to take effect in 1884, from which it was deduced: 'First, that the extension thus granted could add nothing not authorized by the constitution of 1868, under the dominion of which the act was passed, and which required the payment of a license; second, that the grant, to take effect in 1884, became subject to the constitution adopted in 1879, which also required, or authorized the legislature to require, the payment of the license.' (4) Even if this were not so, the acceptance by the bank of the act No. 79 of 1880 'specifically and in terms subjected it to the constitution of 1879, and thereby placed it out of the power of the legislature to exempt it from the payment of the license imposed on other institutions of the same class.' \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 76]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Watkins delivered a separate opinion, and placed his concurrence on the distinction between a license tax and a property tax, and said that 'the conclusion is perfectly clear that a property tax was only in contemplation of the legislature in framing that exemption.' And also said that the license law under which the state proceeded 'does not conflict with the contract clause of the Federal Constitution by impairing the contract rights of the defendant bank under its charter.' Concluding his opinion, the learned justice observed:\n'In my view, it is unnecessary for this court to go into any discussion of the constitutional questions raised and adverted to in the opinion of the majority, for the reason that, on the face of the charter exemption, which the bank pleads, its liability is apparent.\n\n'It is my view, also, that the better course of decision is, and one more in harmony with the general jurisprudence of this court, to avoid discussion of Federal questions which only arise incidentally, and are unnecessary to the decision of the principal question at issue.\n\n'Entertaining this view, I think it is preferable to pass the constitutional question under consideration, and reverse the judgment of the district court, and sustain the license on the face of the charter and the law.'\n\n Mr. Justice Breaux and Mr. Justice Blanchard dissented, each filing an opinion.\nMessrs. Henry Denis, Eugene D. Saunders, Branch K. Miller, and Murphy j. Foster for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. E. Howard McCaleb, Jr., and E. Howard McCaleb for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n 1. \nA motion is made to dismiss. The ground of it is that, even \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 77]\n\u00a0\n if the charter of 1833 and the amendment of 1836 exempted the bank from license taxes, the bank, by accepting the act of 1880, which enabled the bank to make compromises with its mortgage creditors, became subject to the constitution of 1879, which, it is contended, authorized or required the legislature to impose a license tax. And, besides, the act of 1874, extending the charter, was subject to the constitution of 1868, and that required the payment of a license. Upon those grounds Mr. Justice Monroe based his opinion, and they, it is urged, involved state questions sufficient to sustain the judgment. But those grounds only had the concurrence of the Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Watkins did not assent to them and Justices Breaux and Blanchard dissented from them. The judgment of the court, therefore, does not rest upon them. The judgment rests upon the construction of the original charter,-that is, upon the contract between the state and the bank,-but to construe that is also our function.\n But assuming that the judgment rests upon the grounds stated, we nevertheless have the power of review. The Federal question presented is, Did the bank, at the time of the imposition of the license tax sued for, have a contract with the state exempting it (the bank) from such tax? The elements of that question are the original contract and all subsequent legislation relating to the contract and which it is claimed modifies or changes it. The motion to dismiss is, therefore, denied.\n\n 2. \nThe question presented on the merits has been simplified by the case of New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 371\n, 42 L. ed. 202, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905. The origin and history of the bank are there detailed, its charter and its exemptions are construed, its litigations with the city are recited, and their effect declared. We need only apply and extend the reasoning of that case to decide this.\n It came here from the circuit court of the United States. It was brought in that court by a bill in equity to enjoin the taxing officers of the state and of the city of New Orleans from taxing the bank under certain provisions of a statute of the \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 78]\n\u00a0\n state for the assessment of the capital of banks. Under the statute the capital stock of banks which were represented by shares were not assessed by that name, but the shares were required to be assessed to the stockholders at their actual valuation as shown by the books of the bank, and the taxes assessed were required to be paid by the bank, which was given the power to collect the amount from the shareholders or their transferees. The real estate owned by the bank was directed to be assessed directly to it and the tax 'proportioned to each share of capital stock' and deducted from the amount of taxes of that share under the statute. The statute also contained provisions for its administration, and required property which had been omitted from the assessment rolls to be assessed for the current year and for three years back. The court adjudged the bank to be exempt from the taxation, and granted an injunction against the collection of the taxes for the designated years by the state of Louisiana, and the city of New Orleans, 'upon the capital, property, or shares of stock of the shareholders of said bank, whether assessed against the bank or its shareholders.'\n The writ also enjoined the demanding or collecting from the bank of any state or city license tax. Commenting on the decree, this court said:\n'The exemptions to which the decree below held the bank to be entitled related, therefore, to distinct objects of taxation, one not necessarily connected with or dependent upon the other, and may be summarized as follows: First. That the bank was not subject to taxation on its capital shares of stock or real estate, and furniture actually used for the carrying on of its banking business, and that the bank could not be lawfully obliged to pay the sum of any tax assessed on its shareholders. Second. That the stockholders of the bank were not liable for assessment on their shares of stock. Third. That the bank was also not subject to taxation on any real estate held by it which had been mortgaged to secure stock subscriptions and had become the property of the bank under foreclosure pro- \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 79]\n\u00a0\n ceedings, because property so acquired became, by virtue of the purchase, a part of its capital stock. Fourth. That the nonliability of the bank to taxation embraced also immunity from the payment of a license tax to either the state of Louisiana or the city of New Orleans.'\n\n The decree was affirmed as to the objects of taxation embraced in the 1st subdivision, and reversed as to those embraced in the 2d, 3d, and 4th subdivisions. Of the objects in the 4th subdivision it was said:\n'We are at a loss to understand by what process of reasoning the decree was made to cover the question of the nonliability of the bank for license. It was not presented by the pleadings, and was entirely dehors the issue in the case.'\n\n In sustaining the decree of the circuit court as to the objects in the first subdivision, necessarily there was involved the decision that the charter of the bank, both as originally granted and as extended, exempted the capital of the bank from taxation, and the exemption was not taken away by the constitutions of 1868 and 1879 by the acceptance of the act of 1874 by the bank, nor by the act of 1880. Many considerations were referred to which might have justified this as an independent conclusion, but the decision was mainly rested upon the judgments of the courts of Louisiana which had been pleaded as res judicata, and which judgments, it was decided, had concluded the controversies. There was a clear adjudication, therefore, of the right of exemption of the bank from a tax on its capital.\n The ruling in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank has been followed by the supreme court of Louisiana. In Penrose v. Chaffraix, 106 La. 250, 256, 30 So. 718, 720, the same questions were raised on the statutes of 1874 and 1880 and the constitutions of 1868 and 1879, as are raised in the case at bar. The court, replying to them, said:\n'Both these contentions were passed upon and negatived in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 371\n, 42 L. ed. 202, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905, and the effect of that decision of the Supreme Court of the United States is \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 80]\n\u00a0\n to maintain and carry the exemption into the extended period of the bank's charter.'\n\n It is true that in a subsequent case (State v. American Sugar Ref. Co. 108 La. 603, 32 So. 965) New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank is criticized and its views are not concurred in as to what constitutes the thing adjudged and an estoppel in tax cases. But the thing claimed to have been adjudged was not a right claimed under the Constitution of the United States, and there was no intimation of disapproval of Penrose v. Chaffraix.\n But if it can be contended that there is conflict between the state cases, New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank is, nevertheless, decisive of the questions adjudged by it. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 U.S. 499\n, ante, 154, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154. And all the questions in the case at bar were adjudged by it except the question of the exemption of the bank from the payment of license taxes. That question is now presented, and we think the exemption exists. We deduce this not only from the words of the charter, but from the purpose of its enactment and of its extension. The bank was made an agency of the state. To have fostered it with aid and to have burdened it with taxation of any kind would have been inconsistent, considering the provisions of the act incorporating it, and it was immaterial whether it was constituted a quasi public corporation or entirely a private one. It was created to accomplish purposes in which the state took an interest, and the expectations which were entertained of it may be regarded in the interpretation of its charter. With the wisdom or folly of the charter we have nothing to do. Our sole function is to interpret it. It may seem, in 1903, to have been imprudent legislation. But how did it appear in 1833 and 1836? We must contemplate it as of that time. States act through men, and, of course, cannot have a greater appreciation or prophecy of things than men. Events may disappoint or baffle their purposes, but they cannot, for that reason, be relieved from their obligations. Nor can they necessarily be accused of folly. There are limits to the power of government, and the wisest provisions may be frustrated or turned to \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 81]\n\u00a0\n detriment by causes which no prescience can foresee. It is, therefore, to 1833 and 1836 we must turn, to the conditions and purposes of then.\n The chief industry of Louisiana was agriculture, and it seemed to the state a wise policy to encourage and expand that industry, and the means selected was a bank which could make loans to the planters upon the security of their lands. Capital was necessary. Private persons were to be induced to subscribe, and the state aided by an issue and pledge of its bonds. It was careful to make provision for control. No act of administration could be undertaken without its consent. It was represented by six members on a board of twelve directors. It, besides, contemplated the probability of profits, and made provision to share them. The scheme was large and hazardous. Private capital had to be tempted to it, and the state, besides contributing its credit, offered the inducement of a relief from burdens. There is no doubt of this, and the dispute is only as to the degree, and, on an ambiguity which may be asserted upon a distinction in the form of taxation, a limitation is attempted to be put upon the comprehensive and expressive words of the bank's charter. This seems to us not justified. The words of the charter are 'the capital of the bank shall be exempt from any tax.' The word any excludes selection or distinction. It declares the exemption without limitation. And why should there have been limitation? What purpose was there to serve by making a distinction between the forms of taxation? The state did not intend to so limit its aid. It did not mean to help the bank to do business and then tax the business when done,-relieve it and burden it at the same time. Retain the right to impose as an occupation tax that which it gave up as a right to impose as a property tax.\n This view is sustained by contemporaneous construction of the bank's charter. It was not only the immediate sense of the officers of the state, but their continued sence through a number of years, that the bank was exempt from all taxation, \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 82]\n\u00a0\n and when the right of taxation was asserted a license tax was not included. And we have authority for saying that a license tax was not demanded during a period of fifty-eight years, notwithstanding the many changes in the administrative officers of the state; that during all that time, 'even from and inclusive of the very first revenue act (that of 1813), adopted after the admission of the state into the Union, license taxation as a means of revenue was provided for and enforced,' and for a portion of the time (from 1869) license taxes were imposed upon banks.\n Stress is put in the argument at bar upon the distinction between taxes on property and taxes on occupations. The distinction exists and counsel have cited Louisiana decisions in which that distinction has been held to justify license taxes, notwithstanding clauses in charters exempting capital stock from taxation. a review of theoses cases is not necessary. They were all rendered subsequently to 1836, and they depended upon the application of the constitution of 1868 or 1879, or special circumstances not applicable to the charter of the Citizens' Bank. And those cases did not embarrass the court in defining the scope of the charter of the Citizens' Bank in the decisions presently to be considered.\n That the distinction between property taxes and license taxes was recognized in Louisiana in 1833 or 1836 is not very clear, but subsequently the distinction was certainly not always considered as justifying a power to impose license taxes. In New Orleans v. Southern Bank, 11 La. Ann. 41, the general law of the state, approved April 30, 1853, called the Free Banking Law, was considered. The law provided 'that bankers and banking companies, doing business under this act, shall be taxed upon their capital stock (italics ours) at the same rate as other personal property under the laws of the state.' It was held that the provision was a contract with the individual corporations formed under the act, and a license tax imposed by the common council of the city under an act passed in 1842 (Session Acts of 1842, p. 17), which \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 83]\n\u00a0\n empowered the city to levy a license tax on certain enumerated occupations and 'all other callings, professions, or business,' was illegal.\n The same question was presented again in State v. Southern Bank, 23 La. Ann. 271, upon a license tax imposed by the revenue laws of 1889. The court was urged to overrule New Orleans v. Southern Bank. The court refused to do so and affirmed the doctrine of that case, and held the act 'violative of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States.' The supreme court of Louisiana, therefore, as early as 1853, construed a provision exempting the capital stock of a bank from taxation except at a particular rate as exempting the bank from a license tax. In other words, it was held that a license tax was virtually a tax on the capital of the banks, and, we think, that must be held of the tax in the case at bar. Whatever the tax may be called,-one on property or one on occupations,-if its final incidence is on the capital, it is comprehended in the exemption contained in the charter. As we have already pointed out, the language of the charter is universal; and it was said in Citizens' Bank v. Bouny, 32 La. Ann. 239, 'That language is broad enough to cover everything which, during its existence, should enter into and make part of the capital of said bank.' If the language is broad enough to preclude a tax upon that which may become part of the capital of the bank, it is broad enough to preclude a tax which may become a burden upon the capital. Whatever diminishes the income of a bank diminishes its capital under the provisions of the charter of 1833. It was said in the Bouny Case: 'By the 29th section of the original charter, 'all the profits made by said corporation shall be added to and made a part of its capital,' except a certain fraction of any excess of profits over what was necessary to pay the bonds issued by the bank.' And the sum of $159,238.62 accumulated profits were held not to be liable to taxation. And fully as significant was the exemption declared of the sum of $636,450, assessed to the shareholders of the bank as 'value of capital \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 84]\n\u00a0\n stock.' It was said: 'Even if the shareholders be liable to taxation on their shares (upon which we express no opinion), under the peculiar and exceptionable nature of the charter of the Citizens' Bank, we think it cannot be forced to pay the taxes assessed to its shareholders.' In other words, the burden of tax could not be put upon the bank, however it could be imposed upon the stockholders.\n We may recur to Penrose v. Chaffraix. It was a proceeding to recover the payment of a tax for the year 1899, imposed upon a certain number of shares of the capital stock of the Citizens' Bank held by Chaffraix. Exemption was asserted under the clause of the bank's charter which we have quoted. This was one of the questions left open by this court in New Orleans v. Citizens Bank, and left open in the Bouny Case. The exemption, nevertheless, was sustained. It was recognized that in some jurisdictions, 'including the Supreme Court of the United States,' it was held that the exemption of the capital of a corporation from taxation does not of necessity include the exemption of the shareholders on their shares of stock. But the court considered that it was not necessary to approve or disapprove the doctrine, and rejected it as inapplicable to shares in the Citizens' Bank, because the intent of the legislature was otherwise. And that intent was deduced 'not only from the words of the charter,' but from the purposes for which the bank was instituted, and they were vividly described. Because of them, it was in effect said, and of the bank's relation to them and the state's relation to the bank, the state 'granted the clause quoted above, exempting from taxation.' And it was observed, 'at that time the refined distinction between the capital and the capital stock of a corporation had not been made by the courts, or was at least unrecognized as yet in Louisiana.' We see, therefore, that in the Bouny Case it was held that a tax on that which might become capital, or a tax which the bank would have to pay, is illegal. In the Chaffraix Case it is held that a tax which falls on the stockholders of the bank is illegal. In other words, the \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 85]\n\u00a0\n effect of the two cases is that a tax which falls upon the capital or is to be paid by the bank or its stockholders, is prohibited. A license tax has surely some one of those effects.\n It is urged, however, that neither the Bouny Case nor the Chaffraix Case can be adduced as authoritative. The argument is that a judgment in the case at bar has become the law of the case, and that it cannot be affected by what was or has been decided in some other case, and that the judgment in the case at bar rested on non-Federal grounds which were sufficient to sustain it, to wit, the construction and application of the constitutions and statutes of that state. The argument is the same as that directed against our jurisdiction, and has been answered. When a contract is asserted, and the Constitution of the United States invoked to protect it, all of the elements which are claimed to constitute it are open to our review; and, also, all of that which is claimed to have taken it away. We are certainly not confined to the decision under review. To hold that would surrender the power of review. That decision, of course, claims our first and a most thoughtful consideration, but in the right to challenge it is the right to go outside of it, and certainly nothing can afford more light or persuasion than the utterances of the same tribunal on prior and subsequent occasions.\n These propositions, then, are established: the exemption granted to the bank in 1833 and 1836 was not taken away by the acts extending its charter, and the application thereto of the constitutions of 1868 and 1879. This was the thing adjudged in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 371\n, 42 L. ed. 202, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905.\n The exemption of the charter includes a license tax. This, for the reasons stated, must be regarded as part of the contract between the state and the bank. And in reaching that conclusion the rule requiring a strict construction of statutes exempting property from taxation has not been infringed. We recognize the force and salutary character of the rule, but it must not be misunderstood. It is not a substitute for all other rules. It does not mean that whenever a controversy is or can \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 86]\n\u00a0\n be raised of the meaning of a statute, ambiguity occurs, which immediately and inevitably determines the interpretation of the statute. The decisive simplicity of such effect is very striking. It conveniently removes all difficulties from judgment in many cases of controverted construction of laws. But we cannot concede such effect to the rule, nor is such effect necessary in order to make the rule useful and, at times, decisive. Its proper office is to help to solve ambiguities, not to compel an immediate surrender to them,-to be an element in decision, and effective, maybe, when all other tests of meaning have been employed which experience has afforded, and which it is the duty of courts to consider when rights are claimed under a statute. Will courts ever be exempt, or have they ever been exempt, from that duty? Has skill in the use of language ever been so universal, or will it ever be so universal, as to make indubitably clear the meaning of legislation? Has forecast of events ever been so sure, or will it ever be so sure, as to make inevitably certain all the objects contemplated by a statute? We think not, and there never will be a time in which judicial interpretation of laws will not be invoked, and it cannot be omitted because a doubt may be asserted concerning the meaning of the legislators. We repeat, it is the judicial duty to ascertain if doubt exists.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, with whom the Chief Justice concurs, dissenting:\n I dissent from the opinion and judgment in this case, and will state briefly my reasons therefor: Where it is contended that a state, having once entered into a contract, has, by subsequent legislation, impaired its obligations, this court, while exercising its independent judgment in respect to the terms of the contract and the fact of impairment, will lean to the views announced by the courts of that state. In Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399, 412\n, 46 S. L. ed. 612, 618, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384, 389, we said: \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 87]\n\u00a0\n 'But as the general rule is that the interpretation put on a state constitution or laws by the supreme court of such state is binding upon this court, and as our right to review and revise decisions of the state courts in cases where the question is of an impairment by legislation of contract rights is an exception, perhaps the sole exception, to the rule, it will be the duty of this court, even in such a case, to follow the decision of the state court when the question is one of doubt and uncertainty. Especial respect should be had to such decisions when the dispute arises out of general laws of a state, regulating its exercise of the taxing power, or relating to the state's disposition of its public lands. In such cases it is frequently necessary to recur to the history and situation of the country in order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of the laws, and knowledge of such particulars will most likely be found in the tribunals whose special function is to expound and interpret the state enactments.'\n Where it is contended that exemption from taxation has been granted by contract with the state, the exemption, if any be found to exist, will not be extended by construction, but will be confined to that which is clearly within the terms of the contract.

Rep. 471.\n In the last of these cases, on page 177, L. ed. p. 661, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 472, we said:\n'It must always be borne in mind in construing language of this nature that the claim for exemption must be made out wholly beyond doubt; for, as stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, in Chicago, B. & K. C. R. Co. v. Guffey, \n120 \nU.S. 569, 575\n, 30 S. L. ed. 732, 734, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 693, 696, 'It is the settled doctrine of this court that an immunity from taxation by a state will not be recognized unless granted in terms too plain to be mistaken.\" \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 88]\n\u00a0\n And in next to the last, on page 146, L. ed. p. 649, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 460, we also said:\n\n'These cases show the principle upon which is founded the rule that a claim for exemption from taxation must be clearly made out. Taxes being the sole means by which sovereignties can maintain their existence, any claim on the part of any one to be exempt from the full payment of his share of taxes on any portion of his property must, on that account, be clearly defined and founded upon plain language. There must be no doubt or ambiguity in the language used upon which the claim to the exemption is founded. It has been said that a well founded doubt is fatal to the claim; no implication will be indulged in for the purpose of construing the language used as giving the claim for exemption, where such claim is not founded upon the plain and clearly expressed intention of the taxing power.'\n\n Only last term the same doctrine was reaffirmed in Chicago Theological Seminary v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 662, 672\n, 47 S. L. ed. 641, 648, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 386, 387, in these words:\n'The rule is that, in claims for exemption from taxation under legislative authority, the exemption must be plainly and unmistakably granted; it cannot exist by implication only; a doubt is fatal to the claim.'\n\n I make these quotations, which are in harmony with the many other decisions of this court, for even the most casual examination of them makes it apparent that the rule therein stated is plainly ignored in this case, and that a term whose meaning is well understood is stretched beyond its ordinary significance and to its utmost limits in order to include the alleged exemption.\n The supreme court of Louisiana in this case held that a license tax was not within the exemption of the bank from any tax upon its capital, the one being a charge for the privilege of carrying on the business, and the other an exemption of a part of the property of the bank from taxation. In the course of its opinion it said, after referring to a prior case:\n'There the tax resisted, like those resisted in the cases relied on, was at least a tax of the same character; that is, a tax \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 89]\n\u00a0\n upon 'property,' while the tax involved in this litigation is one essentially different; it is a tax, it is true, but one upon callings or occupations, and it is controlled and governed by rules and principles entirely different from those which bear upon property taxation. New Orleans v. Louisiana Sav. Bank & S. D. Co. 31 La. Ann. 638; Walters v. Duke, 31 La. Ann. 671; Morehouse v. Brigham, 41 La. Ann. 667, 6 So. 257; Articles 203, 206, 207, and 209 of the constitution of 1879 also disclose this very fully and clearly. (See New Orleans v. Ernst, 35 La. Ann. 746, and State ex rel. Ernst v. State & City Board, 36 La. Ann. 347.)\n\n ... * *\n'The defendant urges that the license tax is substantially one upon its capital. The views expressed by us above indicate our opinion upon this point. The mere reference in the license acts to the declared or nominal capital or surplus from business or banking institutions is not a tax upon the capital or surplus itself of the different banks, but a mere method of classifying the banks and establishing a graduation of licenses, as required by article 206 of the Constitution. State v. Liverpool, L. & G. Ins. Co. 40 La. Ann. 463, 4 So. 504; Morehouse v. Brigham, 41 La. Ann. 666, 6 So. 257.\n\n'This court, in New Orleans v. State Nat. Bank, 34 La. Ann. 892, said: 'A provision in the charter of a corporation exempting its stock and real estate from taxation does not cover an exemption from license taxation. The grant of a charter to a bank, authorizing it to carry on a certain business during the term of its charter, does not import permission to do so without contributing to the support of the government in like manner with natural persons pursuing the same business.'\n\n ... * *\n'The extent of the exemption granted originally from taxation was from 'taxation upon its capital.' It could never have claimed greater or other exemption than that. The law of \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 90]\n\u00a0\n 1890, the unconstitutionality of which is pleaded, does not pretend to impose, nor does it impose any tax upon the 'bank's capital,' and therefore there could by no possibility be, nor is there, any violation of any contract obligation through that act, even should there really be any existing obligation at all between the state and the defendant as to taxation.'\n\n That there is a clear distinction between a property tax on the capital of a corporation and a license tax for the privilege of carrying on the business of the corporation has been so often decided by this and other courts, and is so clear, that it seems almost a waste of words to refer to decisions. And yet it may be well to refer to a few that it may be apparent how strongly, emphatically, and for how long a time the distinction has been affirmed. As a preliminary thereto let it be borne in mind that the franchise of a corporation is the privilege granted to it to do the business named in its charter, and a license tax for the privilege of doing business is simply a tax upon the franchise. In Gordon v. Appeal Tax Ct. 3 How. 133, 150, 11 L. ed. 529, 537, decided in 1844, it was said:\n'A franchise for banking is in every state of the Union, recognized as property. The banking capital attached to the franchise is another property, owned in its parts by persons, corporate or natural, for which they are liable to be taxed, as they are for all other property, for the support of government.'\n\n In Hamilton Mfg. Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632, 640, 18 L. ed. 904, 907:\n'Property taxation and excise taxation, as authorized in the Constitution of the state, are perfectly distinct.'\n\n'In Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 24 L. ed. 558, Mr. Justice Swayne, after referring to taxation of bank capital and shares of stock, added (p. 687, L. ed. p. 560):\n\n'There are other objects in this connection liable to taxation. It may be well to advert to some of them.\n\n'1. The franchise to be a corporation and exercise its powers in the prosecution of its business.'\n\n In Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 29 S. L. ed. 830, 832, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645, 647, Chief Justice Waite declared: \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 91]\n\u00a0\n 'In corporations four elements of taxable value are sometimes found; 1, franchises; 2, capital stock in the hands of the corporation; 3, corporate property; and, 4, shares of the capital stock in the hands of the individual stockholders. Each of these is, under some circumstances, an appropriate subject of taxation; and it is no doubt within the power of a state, when not restrained by constitutional limitations, to assess taxes upon them in a way to subject the corporation or the stockholders to double taxation.'\n Both of these last cases were cited with approval in Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 40 S. L. ed. 645, 649, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456. Many more cases might be cited to the same effect, but these will serve as illustrations. It is conceded that this distinction was recognized in Louisiana, though it is contended that it was not always held sufficient to uphold, in the case of a contract exemption of the capital, the retention of a power to impose license taxes, and some early decisions of the supreme court of that state are cited. But what does this argument amount to? Because the distinction between the two taxes has not always been recognized in Louisiana it must now be repudiated. The legislature must be held to have not recognized the distinction in this case, because the courts have sometimes in other cases failed to recognize it. It is not pretended that there has been a uniform ruling on the part of the supreme court of Louisiana ignoring the distinction. On the contrary, this very case (and this is only one of several) recognizes it. It seems to me this is a plain overturning of the hitherto settled rule of this court, that a doubt is to be resolved in favor of a state, for the alleged doubt in this particular case is resolved in favor of the corporation.\n But upon what ground is it claimed that a doubt exists? Why should not the legislature be credited with recognizing the distinction recognized elsewhere through the country and sometimes at least, if not always, in Louisiana? It is said that there is something peculiar in the organization of this bank; that its purpose was to aid the agricultural interests of the \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 92]\n\u00a0\n state, and that the state assisted by a loan of its credit, and retained partial control through directors appointed by it. But is it not the rule that an exemption from taxation is not given as a gratuity, but by reason of some supposed benefit to the state as a whole or some particular interest therein? Does the fact that some interest in the state is specially benefited change the rule as to the construction of an exemption? It seems to me that that is a doctrine as novel as it is dangerous. It is true that the state loaned its credit, and retained a partial control through directors appointed by it, but we have in the legislation of Congress and in the decisions of this court a very suggestive analogy. The Union Pacific Railroad Company was a corporation chartered by Congress. It was given a large amount of public lands and the credit of the United States was loaned to it to the extent of $16,000 and over a mile. A partial control was retained through directors appointed by the government. In these respects it presents a close similarity to the Citizens' Bank. It was held by this court that while the franchise given by Congress to this and other transcontinental railroads was exempt from state taxation, yet the property belonging to those corporations was not. California v. Central P. R. Co. \n127 U.S. 1\n, 32 L. ed. 150, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 153, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073; Thomson v. Union P. R. Co. 9 Wall. 579, 19 L. ed. 792; Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 21 L. ed. 787. It was not doubted that Congress could in its discretion have provided for such exemption, but as it failed to prescribe it, the court held that it did not exist. If from the fact that the corporation was aided by bonds of the United States, was engaged in doing the work of the nation in interstate transportation, and a partial control retained by Congress, that its property as well as its franchise was exempt from state taxation, why should there be an inference from the fact that Louisiana aided by its bonds this particular corporation and retained a partial control thereof, that it intended to grant any other exception than was expressly stated?\n Again, it is contended that contemporaneous construction determines that the exemption of the capital included the \n\n[192 U.S. 73, 93]\n\u00a0\n exemption of the franchise. It seems to me a sufficient answer is that in 1853 the supreme court held that a provision exempting the capital stock of a bank from taxation, except at a particular rate, exempted the bank from a license tax. New Orleans v. Southern Bank, 11 La. Ann. 41. It is not strange that thereafter there was no effort to impose a license tax on this bank and that the administrative officers respected the opinion of the supreme court, and did not until of late seek a reconsideration of that ruling. It also appears that there was no specific statute providing for a license tax upon banks until 1869, and that was after the decision of the supreme court referred to.\n It is also said that if a license tax on the franchise is enforced it must be paid out of the capital, and so, in effect, be a tax upon the capital. That argument would make in every case an exemption of the capital a relief from all taxation, for every tax must in the last analysis come out of the capital. But what, under those circumstances, becomes of the doctrine of a strict construction of a contract exemption of taxes?\n Further, it must be remembered that objects and means of taxation were not in the years past sought for with the same avidity as at present. The demand for revenue was not so great, and there was much inattention to the matter of securing objects and devising modes of taxation. So the mere fact that a particular kind of tax was not sought to be enforced upon any institution is not conclusive of the fact that it was necessarily exempt therefrom. It may simply mean that other objects seemed to the taxing authorities more accessible and more conveniently reached for taxation. At any rate, we are not justified in holding that the mere fact of an omission to press such a taxation upon the bank establishes that such a tax was included within the exemption in the face of a ruling of the highest court of the state that it was not.\n For these reasons I am constrained to dissent from the opinion of the court.\n Mr. Justice Harlan also dissents. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIZENS' NAT BANK OF KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI v.

Rev. Stat .  5197, 5198, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493. The suit was brought by the plaintiff in error upon a promissory note for $20,000, with interest at 8 per cent, made on April 29, 1892. The facts, shortly stated, are as follows: On October 29, 1892, the plaintiff bought the defendant's note for $15,000, with interest at 7 per cent. On July 12, 1895, the defendant being behindhand with his payments of interest and also having overdrawn a bank account which he kept in the plaintiff's bank, he gave the plaintiff a new note for $17,500, and interest at 7 per cent, in satisfaction of both liabilities. The amount of this note included three semiannual interest charges of $525 each, with a few days' further interest, on the former note, with interest on this interest from the time it was due, and charges of 1 per cent or more a month on the amount overdrawn each month. It left the defendant with a credit on his bank account of $230.50. On April 29, 1896, the note in suit and another note for $2,000 were given in satisfaction of the last note for $17,500, and of another note for $2,500, of October 1, 1895, with interest accrued on both, and of an overdraft of $ 919.90, and a the beginning of the above transactions, and as before, charges of about 1 per cent a month on the amounts actually overdrawn.\n The supreme court of Missouri held that the plaintiff must forfeit all interest from the beginning of th above transactions, and could recover only the original $15,000, \n\n[195 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n the actual overdraft on July 12, 1895, $474.24, the bank credit of $230, given the same day, the note of October 1, 1895, for $2,500, the overdraft on April 29, 1896, of $878.81, and the bank credit of $2.42-in all, $19, 081.97, less $5,500 collected on account since the action was begun. 172 Mo. 384, 72 S. W. 925.\n By the U. S. Rev. Stat.  5197, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, a bank may charge 'interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state , . . . where the bank is located, and no more.' By  5198 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493), taking, receiving, or charging 'a rate of interest greater than is allowed by the preceding section, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon.' The Revised Statutes of Missouri fix 6 per cent as the rate of interest in the absence of agreement ( 3705), but allow parties to agree in writing for not over 8 per cent ( 3706). They also allow parties to contract in writing for the payment of interest upon interest, 'but the interest shall not be compounded oftener than once in a year' ( 3711). It will be seen that the charge on the overdrafts went beyond  3706, and the compounding of the semiannual interest on the notes encountered  3711\n\n\n The plaintiff in error denies that the prohibition of compounding oftener than once a year affects the 'rate of interest' within the meaning of those words in U. S. Rev. Stat.  5198, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, and contends that so long as the total sums received would not amount to more than 8 per cent on the debt, it has a right to charge them under U. S. Rev. Stat.  5197, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, coupled with Mo. Rev. Stat.  3706. It disposes of the 12 per cent charge on overdrafts by the suggestion that the amount is trifling, and de minimis non curat lex, and that this charge was a penalty because of a failure to pay a debt \n\n[195 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n when due, and therefore not usurious. We are of a different opinion. The rate of interest which an man receives is greater when he is allowed to compound than when he is not, the other elements in the case being the same. Even if the compounded interest is less than might be charged directly without compounding, a statute may forbid enlarging the rate in that way, whatever may be the rules of the common law. The supreme court of Missouri holds that that is what the Missouri statute has done. On that point, and on the question whether what was done amounted to compounding within the meaning of the Missouri statute, we follow the state court. Union Nat. Bank v. Louisville, N. A. & C. R. Co. \n163 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 41 S. L. ed. 177, 179, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1039. Therefore, since the interest charged and received by the plaintiff was compounded more than once a year, it was at a rate greater than was allowed by U. S. Rev. Stat.  5197, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, and it was forfeited. The suggestions as to the 12 per cent charge on overdrafts do not seem to us to need answer.\n There is no doubt, of course, that the court could go behind the face of the present note, and analyze the sum which it represents into its original elements. Brown v. Marion Nat. Bank, \n169 U.S. 416\n, 42 L. ed. 801, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390; Haseltine v. Central Nat. Bank, \n183 \nU.S. 132, 135\n, 136 S., 46 L. ed. 118-120, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. These cases sufficiently show, also, if more is wanted than the words of Rev. Stat.  5198, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, that the court below did not err in forfeiting all the interest from the beginning.\n We perceive no warrant in the statute or the cases for the contention that the bank, when it brings the action and is met by the plea of usury, may avoid the forfeiture imposed by Rev. Stat.  5198, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493, in absolute terms, by then declaring an election to remit the excessive interest.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY & SUBURBAN RY OF WASHINGTON v. SVEDBORG(1904)\nNo. 214\nArgued: April 13, 1904Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The plaintiff in error is a corporation organized under acts of Congress and engaged in the business of carrying passengers for hire in street cars operated on public highways in the District of Columbia.\n The defendant in error was received as a passenger on one of such cars, and, in alighting from the one in which she was riding, was thrown to the ground and seriously injured.\n The present action was brought against the railway company to cover damages on account of such injuries, the theory of the plaintiff's case being that the car in which she was a passenger was stopped for her to alight from it, and, while she was stepping off it, was suddenly and recklessly started, whereby, without negligence on her part, she was violently thrown to the ground.\n The railway company pleaded not guilty as alleged, and the plaintiff joined issue on that plea.\n The case was then tried before the court and a jury, the plaintiff introducing evidence tending to sustain her theory as to the cause of the injuries received by her, while the defendant introduced evidence tending to sustain its theory, which was that the plaintiff negligently attempted to alight from the car before it had actually stopped. \n\n[194 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n At the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury to find in its favor, upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff. That motion was denied, and the defendant excepted. The defendant then introduced evidence, at the close of which the motion to direct a verdict in its favor was renewed. The motion was also denied, and the defendant excepted.\n It appears from the record that the court then granted two instructions at the request of the plaintiff and six instructions asked by the defendant. But none of the instructions so given on either side, were embodied in the bill of exceptions. What they were this court has no means of knowing.\n There was a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for 6,500, and that judgment was affirmed in the court of appeals for the District.\nMessrs. R. B. Behrend, C. C. Cole, and J. J. Darlington for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. A. Lipscomb, Philip Walker, and Charles P. Janney for defendant in error\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The railway company assigns for error the refusal of the trial court to direct the jury to find a verdict in its favor. The refusal was proper; for there was evidence of a substantial character bearing upon the general issue as to the negligence of the defendant, and therefore the question was one peculiarly for the jury. Even if the court thought that the preponderance of evidence was for the defendant, it was not bound, simply for that reason, to have taken the case from the jury, whatever influence that fact might have in disposing of a motion for a new trial.\n It is also assigned for error that the trial court refused to give the following instructions to the jury: \n\n[194 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n In order to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, the burden is upon her to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, to the satisfaction of the jury, that the car stopped for her to alight, and that, while she was in the act of alighting, the car, through the negligence of the motorman, started, and thereby threw her to the pavement, and injured her; and unless, upon the whole evidence, the jury shall so find, the verdict should be for the defendant.'\n The court refused to grant that instruction without inserting after the word 'motorman' the words 'or conductor or both.' These words having been inserted, the instruction was granted. The defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to give the instruction as asked.\n It is contended that it was error prejudicial to the railway company to have added these words to the instruction asked, because, by so doing, the jury were, in effect, told that there was sufficient evidence upon which to base an inquiry whether the conductor was guilty of negligence; whereas, the company insists, there was not the slightest proof showing negligence on the part of the conductor.\n We need not review the evidence as to the conductor; for if, as the defendant insists, there was no evidence whatever showing negligence upon the part of the conductor, then the modification made by the court could not have so misled the jury as to prejudice the defense.\n It is assigned for error that the trial court refused to grant the following instruction asked by the defendant: 'The jury are instructed that under the evidence in this ease they cannot find any negligence on the part of the conductor of the car, and unless they shall find from the evidence that the motorman was guilty of negligence which caused the accident to plaintiff, they should find for the defendant; and in considering that question they cannot infer the existence of any fact not shown to their satisfaction by the evidence.'\n Testing the action of the trial court alone by the evidence set out in the bill of exceptions, we cannot hold that the in- \n\n[194 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n struction in question was improperly denied; for that instruction took it for granted that there was not a scintilla of proof-none whatever-of negligence on the part of the conductor, and that the negligence, if there was any, was wholly or exclusively that of the motorman. The court below was not bound to submit the case to the jury in that way. It was not bound to make a particular part of the evidence the subject of a special instruction. Under the circumstances it properly submitted to the jury the whole case as to the alleged negligence of the company, leaving them to determine whether, under all the evidence, the injury was caused by the negligence of its employees or any of them. The plaintiff was entitled to a verdict if the injury was caused by the negligence of any employee. Pomeroy v. Boston & M. R. Co. 172 Mass. 92, 51 N. E. 523.\n In the argument at the bar much was said by counsel as to the principles of law announced by the court of appeals, particularly in respect of the application of the maxim 'Res ipsa loquitur.' Our attention has been called to many authorities upon that branch of the case. But we deem it unnecessary to extend this opinion by a review of those authorities; for, even if the court of appeals erred in its application of that maxim,-and we express no opinion upon that point,-the judgment should not be reversed, since, as we have seen, the record before us does not show that the trial court committed any error to the substantial prejudice of the defendant.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District must, therefore, be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna dissented. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF CLEVELAND v.

The court, in stating its reasons, confined them exclusively to the alleged impairment of the obligations of contracts, and decided that it was unnecessary to consider the rights alleged under the 14th Amendment. 94 Fed. 385.\n Both parties thereupon amended their pleadings, so that upon the face of the record the facts concerning the alleged impairment of contract rights appeared as found by the court in awarding the temporary injunction. The bill as amended, however, also reiterated the facts originally claimed to constitute a violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The pleadings being thus amended, the complainant moved as follows:\n The above-named complainant, The Cleveland City Railway Company, now comes and moves the court to enter final decree in its favor as prayed for in the amended bill of complaint herein, adjudging the ordinance in said amended bill of complaint described, entitled 'An Ordinance to Provide for a Diminution of the Rate of Fare under Section 7 of an Ordinance Passed August 25th, 1879, entitled 'An Ordinance Granting a Renewal of Franchise to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company to Reconstruct, Maintain and Operate its Street Railroad in and Through Certain Streets of the City of Cleveland,\" passed October 17, 1898, to be null and void and of no effect, in that, as appears by the amended bill of complaint and the admissions of the amended answer herein, said ordinance is in violation of the contract obligations existing between the complainant and the defendant herein, and impairs the contract rights of the \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n complainant, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n'Complainant further shows that, upon the amended bill, amended answer, and replication, it is entitled to the decree without a determination of any of the matters in respect to which issues are raised by the amended answer of the defendant herein.'\n\n The court granted this motion for the reasons which it had expressed in the opinion by it delivered on the allowance of the temporary injunction. A final decree was thereupon entered, perpetually enjoining the enforcement of the assailed ordinance. Because of the constitutional question the case was then appealed directly to this court.\nMessrs. Newton D. Baker and D. C. Westenhaver for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William B. Sanders for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n As will appear by the statement just made, whilst two grounds under the Constitution of the United States were asserted in the bill as originally filled and as amended, the cause was in effect submitted to the court for decree upon one of the constitutional grounds alone,-that is, the alleged impairment of the obligations of certain asserted contracts. Conceding that the alleged rights based on the due process clause were not waived, but were merely reserved for future action, it is manifest that the motion of the complainant for decree on the face of the pleadings confined the controversy exclusively to the alleged contract rights, and we shall therefore treat the case as if it solely involved such rights. The facts necessary to a determination of the question of contracts \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n and their impairment appear on the face of the pleadings, and may be summarized as follows:\n On August 25, 1879, an ordinance was passed by the city council of Cleveland, granting to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company, an Ohio corporation, a renewal franchise for twenty-five years from September 20, 1879, to reconstruct, maintain, and operate its street railroad in and through certain streets of the city of Cleveland. The ordinance was duly accepted. A section of the ordinance was as follow:\n'Sec. 7. Said company shall not charge more than 5 cents fare each way for one passenger over the whole or any part of its line, but said company may charge a reasonable compensation for carrying packages; the council, however, reserves to itself the right to hereafter increase or diminish the rate of fare as it may deem justifiable and expedient.'\n\n In 1880 another Ohio corporation, known as the Woodland Avenue Railway Company, then operating a line of street railroad under several grants from the city of Cleveland, became, by purchase, the owner of the Kinsman Street Railroad, and thereafter operated such road.\n The Woodland Avenue Railway Company, in May, 1883, was granted by ordinance the right to construct an extension of its line, and provision was made in the ordinance for a charge of one fare over the entire line, including the extension. The extension was built and operated as required by the ordinance.\n At the time the ordinance extending the Woodland avenue road just referred to was passed there was in existence another Ohio corporation, styled the West Side Street Railroad Company, operating a line of railroad in Cleveland under a franchise granted by the city council of Cleveland for a term of twenty-five years from February 10, 1883. This road was independent of the Woodland Avenue Railway Company, and operated its cars chiefly upon the west side of the Cuyahoga river, the Woodland avenue line being upon the east side. There was no exchange of traffic between the roads by way \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n of transfers, and each was charging a fare of 5 cents over its line. In 1885, with this condition of affairs existing, the roads named were consolidated as the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company, and the consolidated company became vested with all the property, rights, and privileges of the two constituent companies. The ordinance, the acceptance of which accomplished such consolidation, was as follows: 'An Ordinance to Fix the Terms and Conditions Upon Which the Railway Tracks of the West Side Street Railroad Company and the Tracks of the Woodland Avenue Railway Company and Said Companies May Be Consolidated.\n'Sec. 1. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Cleveland, that the consent of the city is hereby given to the consolidation of the West Side Street Railroad Company and the Woodland Avenue Railway Company on the following conditions:\n\n'The said consolidated company to carry passengers through without change of cars by running all cars through from the workhouse on the Woodland Avenue Railway to the point on the West Side Street Railroad where Condon avenue crosses Lorain street, and, when practicable in the judgment of the council, to do likewise on the branches of the consolidated line, and that for a single fare from any point to any point on the line or branches of the consolidated road no greater charge than 5 cents shall be collected, and that tickets at the rate of eleven for 50 cents or twenty-two $1 shall at all times be kept for sale on the cars by conductors.\n\n'Sec. 2. Said consolidated company shall be subject to all the liabilities, conditions, and penalties to which said several companies are liable; and said consolidated company and its tracks shall, at all times, be subject to the control, regulation, and supervision of the city council, to the same extent that the same several companies and their tracks are now liable.\n\n'Sec. 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and legal publication, the filing with \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n the city of a written agreement accepting and agreeing to the terms thereof, signed by the proper persons for the companies consolidated, and the payment to the city of the expenses of printing and publishing this ordinance.\n\n'Passed February 16, 1885.'\n\n By ordinance dated April 8, 1887, duly accepted, the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company was authorized to lay an additional track and extend its line of railroad. The first section of the ordinance reads as follows:\n'Sec. 1. Be it ordanined by the city council of the City of Cleveland, that the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company, its successors and assigns, be and the same is hereby authorized and empowered to lay an additional track in Franklin avenue, between Pearl street and the westerly line of Franklin circle, and to extend its line of railroad to Franklin avenue from the westerly line of Franklin circle to Kentucky street, as a single track railroad, and connect with the tracks of said company in Kentucky street, as shown on a plan accompanying the petition of said railroad company, and referred to the board of improvements March 14, 1887, and to equip and operate said extension as herein provided, but on the express condition that no increase of fare shall be charged by said railroad company on any part of its main line or on said extension, and so that but one fare, not to exceed 5 cents, shall be charged between any points on said company's main line or extension, including the extension herein granted, and said company shall sell tickets on its cars as follows: Eleven (11) tickets for 50 cents, and twenty-two (22) for $1. And the right herein granted shall terminate with the present grant of the main line, to wit, on the 10th day of February, 1908.'\n\n By ordinance dated August 12, 1887, duly accepted, the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company was authorized to build, equip, and operate an extension of its road therein provided for, the first section containing a provision as to rates of fare and the time of expiration of the right \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n granted, similar to that contained in the 1st section of the ordinance of April 8, 1887, above quoted. The said railroad company also duly accepted an ordinance, passed on or about June 20, 1892, by the city council of Cleveland, relating to the laying of an additional track on Kinsman street, and the 1st section of the ordinance contained a similar provision to that embodied in the two ordinances last referred to, respecting rates of fare and the time when the right granted should expire.\n Prior to May, 1893, besides the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company, there existed in Cleveland a railroad corporation known as the Cleveland City Cable Railway Company. This corporation, as the successor in right of previous corporations, operated two street railroad lines, one by horse power and the other by cable, and each of said lines charged a cash fare of 5 cents.\n In June, 1893, with the approval of the common council of the city of Cleveland, the Cleveland City Cable Railway Company and the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company became a consolidated corporation, under the name of the Cleveland City Railway Company, the complainant in this cause. By the consolidation it was provided that the lines should be operated as one system, that proper transfers should be issued, and that but one fare should be charged for a continuous passage upon any portion of the consolidated lines.\n It is admitted that, as the result of the various ordinances and consolidations above referred to, the corporations ceased to charge a cash fare of 5 cents for riding over the roads embraced in the Kinsman Street Railroad ordinance of 1879, and on the other roads which had been at that time in existence; and, on the contrary, in consequence of the ordinances and authorized consolidations, there was charged only 5 cents for a ride over the whole system or systems, and tickets were sold and transfers issued as provided in the various ordinances. It is not asserted that the corporations at any time failed to perform the additional obligations imposed upon them by the various ordinances passed subsequently to 1879. \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 528]\n\u00a0\n On October 17, 1898, an ordinance was adopted by the council of the city of Cleveland, reading as follows: 'An Ordinance to Provide for a Diminution of the Rate of Fare Under Section 7 of an Ordinance Passed August 25, 1879, Entitled 'An Ordinance Granting a Renewal of Franchise to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company to Reconstruct, Maintain, and Operate Its Street Railroad in and Through Certain Streets of the City of Cleveland.'\n'Whereas, the city council did, on the 25th day of August, 1879, pass an ordinance entitled 'An Ordinance granting a Renewal of Franchise to the Kinsman Street Railroad Company to Reconstruct, Maintain, and Operate Its Street Railroad in and Through Certain Streets of the City of Cleveland,' by which ordinance said Kinsman Street Railroad Company, its successors, and assigns, were authorized to reconstruct, maintain, and operate its doubletrack street railroad, commencing on Superior street, at the intersection of Water street, thence to and around the southwest corner of Monumental square to Ontario street; thence through Ontario street to and through a portion of Broadway street to Woodland avenue (formerly Kinsman street), thence through said avenue to Madison avenue, subject to certain conditions and limitations; and\n\n'Whereas, it was ordained, as part of these conditions and limitations ( 7), that 'said company shall not charge more than 5 cents fare each way for one passenger over the whole or any part of its line, but said company may charge a reasonable compensation for carrying packages; the council, however, reserves to itself the right to hereafter increase or diminish the rate of fare as it may deem justifiable and expedient;' and\n\n'Whereas, the council does now deem justifiable and expedient a diminution of the rate of fare, therefore--\n\n'Sec. 1. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Cleveland, that the rate of fare for a single continuous passage over the lines, and all extensions thereof, operated under the aforesaid grant to the said Kinsman Street Railroad Company, \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 529]\n\u00a0\n be, and is hereby, fixed at four (4) cents cash far over the whole or any part thereof.\n\n'Sec. 2. For the better accommodation of the public any person, company, or corporation operating said line of railway under said grant shall at all times keep on sale on the cars, when in operation, tickets good for a single continuous passage over said lines and all extensions thereof at the rate of seven tickets for 25 cents.\n\n'Sec. 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and legal publication.'\n\n And this ordinance is the one complained of, the enforcement of which the final decree below enjoined.\n Bearing the facts above stated in mind, we come to consider the merits of the case. Before proceeding, however, to do so, we must dispose of contentions made below and reiterated in the argument in this court, concerning the jurisdiction of the circuit court.\n The alleged want of jurisdiction in the circuit court is based upon two propositions; first, that the suit is not one arising under the Constitution of the United States; and, second, that the subject-matter of the suit is not within the cognizance of a court of equity.\n The argument in support of the first contention presents a twofold aspect: (a) That as the reduction of fares provided in the assailed ordinance only related to carriage over that protion of the consolidated road which was formerly owned by the Kinsman Street Railroad Company, no impariment of the obligation of a contract could or did arise, because in the ordinance of 1879 there was an express reservation of the right of the city to alter the rates of fare as to the road affected by that ordinance.\n The proposition is without merit. It assumes a false issue; and upon that erroneous premise, the challenge to the jurisdiction is based. The complainant did not rely upon a contract arising from the ordinance of 1879, but upon the contracts alleged to have resulted from the subsequent ordinances, which \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 530]\n\u00a0\n it was in substance asserted had deprived the city of the power to exercise the right reserved in the ordinance of 1879, and it was these subsequent contracts which it was contended were impaired by the assailed ordinance.\n\n\n (b)\n That there was no jurisdiction, even although the complainant relied upon contracts arising from the ordinances adopted subsequent to that of 1879. To constitute the impairment of a contract within the sense of the Constitution, it is correctly argued, requires that some subsequent action taken by the state or under its authority should have been given effect as against the contract. The argument is that as there had not been delegated by the state of Ohio to the city of Cleveland independent authority to reduce rates of fares on street railroads, and as the power asserted by the assailed ordinance was based solely on the right reserved in the ordinance of 1879, it follows that the assailed ordinance, even if unwarranted, was not an impairment of a contract right in the constitutional sense.\n This proposition is in conflict with the one just considered, and in effect assumes that the defense of the city was without merit, and hence there was no jurisdiction. But irrespective of the assumption upon which it rests, the proposition is untenable, and the argument by which it is sought to be sustained is somewhat wanting in consistency. The passage by the city of the assailed ordinance necessarily amounted to an assertion on its part that the legislative authority vested in it to pass the ordinance of 1879 gave the continued power to pass subsequent ordinances executing the rights initiated by the ordinance of 1879, despite the ordinances which had supervened. This in its very essence was the assertion of a delegated power to legislate against the contracts embodied in the ordinances relied upon. We have said that the argument is somewhat wanting in consistency, because the contention of the city on the record is that the ordinances asserted as contracts, passed subsequently to 1879, did not deprive the city of the continued power to exert authority as to rates, because \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 531]\n\u00a0\n the statutes of Ohio prevented the city from abrogating, by the subsequent contracts, the rights reserved in the ordinance of 1879. And this is but to assert that, as a consequence of the continued effect of the legislation of the state of Ohio, the city had the power to pass the assailed ordinance, even although it had apparently disabled itself from so doing by the passage of many ordinances adopted after 1879 and up to the time when the assailed ordinance was passed. These considerations distinguish this case from Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90, and St. Paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 U.S. 142\n, 45 L. ed. 788, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 575, relied upon by the appellant.\n Respecting the contention that the case presented by the record was not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, it suffices to say that, in view of the controversies, confusion, risks, and multiplicity of suits which would necessarily have been occasioned by the resistance of the complainant to the enforcement of the ordinance, and in view of the public interests and the vast number of people to be affected, the case was one within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. This conclusion is, we think, besides, inevitable, when it is borne in mind that the ordinance in question did not purport to reduce rates of fare upon the consolidated line, but was made operative alone upon a section of that line, and, therefore, necessarily would have engendered the enforcement of two rates of fare over the same line, leading to consequences dangerous to the public interest, peace, and tranquillity, the extent of which it would be difficult in advance to perceive. And this, we think, brings the case directly within the principle by which jurisdiction in equity was maintained in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410.\n We come, then, to the merits. For convenience of reference we copy in the margin pertinent sections of the Revised Stat- \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 532]\n\u00a0\n utes of Ohio, embracing all which, either directly or indirectly, during the period covered by the ordinances set out in the bill, vested the municipal council of Cleveland with power to regu- \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 533]\n\u00a0\n late or to contract in respect to the rates of fare to be charged by street railways.\n The statutes show that there was lodged by the legislature \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 534]\n\u00a0\n of Ohio in the municipal council of Cleveland comprehensive power to contract with street railway companies in respect to the terms and conditions upon which such roads might be constructed, operated, extended, and consolidated, the only limitation upon the power being that in case of an extension or consolidation no increase in the rate of fare should be allowed.\n That in passing ordinances based upon the grant of power referred to, the municipal council of Cleveland was exercising a portion of the authority of the state, as an agency of the state, cannot in reason be disputed. If, therefore, the ordinances passed after August, 1879, and referred to previously, which ordinances were accepted by the predecessors of the complainant, with whom it is in privity, constituted contracts in respect to the rates of fare to be thereafter charged upon the consolidated and extended lines (affected by the ordinances) as an entirety, it necessarily follows that the ordinance of October, 1898, impaired these contracts.\n The question for decision, then, is, Did the consolidated ordinance of February, 1885, and the ordinances thereafter passed and accepted, already referred to, constitute binding contracts in respect to the rates of fare to be thereafter exacted upon the consolidated and extended lines of the complainant?\n That in the courts of Ohio the acceptance of an ordinance of the character of those just referred to is deemed to create a binding contract is settled. Cincinnati & S. R. Co. v. Carthage, 36 Ohio St. 631, 634; Columbus v. Columbus Street R. Co. 45 Ohio St. 98, 12 N. E. 651. But let us consider the question without \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 535]\n\u00a0\n treating the Ohio decisions as conclusive. It is undoubtedly true that immediately before, and for a long time prior to, the passage of the ordinances concerning the various consolidations and extensions referred to, the respective roads affected thereby were charging a cash fare of 5 cents over their respective lines, and that the effect of the consolidations and extensions was to secure to the public the benefit of a cash fare of 5 cents over the whole length of the consolidated and extended lines.\n Now, undoubtedly, the common council of Cleveland, in authorizing the extension and consolidation of the lines of street railroads in question, did so because, in its opinion, such extensions and consolidations would operate beneficially to the public. See near the close of  2505, Ohio Rev. Stat. previously inserted in the margin. That in exercising these powers it was the intention of the city to avail of the authority conferred by  3443 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, 'to fix the terms and conditions upon which such railways may be constructed, operated, extended, and consolidated,' and that it was also the intention of the city to execute binding agreements in respect to the rates of fare to be thereafter charged by the railroad companies, will, we think, become clearly apparent by considering the language employed in the ordinances. Thus, in the ordinance of February 16, 1885, fixing the terms and conditions upon which the West Side Street Railroad Company and the Woodland Avenue Railway Company, and the tracks of those companies, might be consolidated, it was specifically provided 'that for a single fare from any point to any point on the line or branches of the consolidated road, no greater charge than 5 cents shall be collected, and that tickets at the rate of eleven for 50 cents or twenty-two for $1 shall at all times be kept for sale on the cars by conductors.' The acceptance of this ordinance by the railroad companies affected thereby was required to be in writing, and filed with the city. Like provisions were contained in the ordinance of April 8, 1887, authorizing the laying \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 536]\n\u00a0\n of an additional track and the extension of the lines of the Woodland Avenue & West Side Street Railroad Company, and there was also a declaration, following the authorization of the extension and the rates to be charged on the whole line, that 'The right herein granted shall terminate with the present grant of the main line, to wit, on the 10th day of February, 1908.' The ordinance of August 12, 1887, authorizing a further extension, and the ordinance of June 20, 1892, authorizing the double tracking of a portion of the line, contained similar language.\n In reason, the conclusion that contracts were engendered would seem to result from the fact that the provisions as to rates of fare were fixed in ordinances for a stated time and no reservation was made of a right to alter; that by those ordinances existing rights of the corporations were surrendered, benefits were conferred upon the public, and obligations were imposed upon the corporations to continue those benefits during the stipulated time. When, in addition, we consider the specific reference to limitations of time which the ordinances contained, and the fact that a written acceptance by the corporations of the ordinances was required, we can see no escape from the conclusion, that the ordinances were intended to be agreements binding upon both parties, definitely fixing the rates of fare which might be thereafter charged. Taking all the circumstances above referred to into account, the case before us clearly falls within the rule as to the binding character of agreements respecting rates applied in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, and approvingly referred to in Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 U.S. 437\n, 47 L. ed. 891, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531. This being the case, the question is whether the ordinance of 1898 impaired the obligations of those contracts.\n By the assailed ordinance the city of Cleveland, assuming to assert continuing delegated power, and upon the theory that the subsequent contracts were void as to that power, disregarded the provisions for consolidations, extensions, etc., and \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 537]\n\u00a0\n whilst retaining all the benefits procured by the ordinances for the public, reduced the cash and ticket fares over the portions of the line embraced in the ordinance of 1879, of the Kinsman Street Railroad, which had long since lost its identity and become merged with other roads. That this was an impairment of the contracts embodied in the prior ordinances, we think is free from doubt.\n Finally, it is contended that the ordinances embodying the contracts were void in so far as they attempted to deprive the city of the continuing legislative power to act on the reservation contained in the ordinance of 1879. This is based on the assumption that the right reserved in that ordinance to increase or reduce rates of fare was an obligation and liability imposed upon the railroad corporation within the meaning of  2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, declaring that a municipal corporation should not, during the term of a grant or renewal thereof, release the grantee from any obligation or liability imposed by grant. But it has been held in Ohio, on reasoning commending itself, that a modification of a contract between a municipality and the owner of a street railroad, made in good faith, for the better accommodation of the public, is not void by virtue of said  2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio. Clement v. Cincinnati, 16 Ohio L. J. 355, decided June 14, 1886, by the general term of the superior court of Cincinnati; leave to file a petition in error refused by the supreme court of Ohio, on January 17, 1888. 19 Ohio L. J. 74.\n It is further contended 'that any attempt to treat the consent to extensions, consolidations, or change of motive power as renewals of the rights renewed by the ordinance of 1879, must be nugatory in view of the positive provisions of the statute above cited, which confer upon municipal corporations power to make such renewals only at the expiration of existing grants.' This contention has also been passed upon by the courts of Ohio, construing the provisions of the Revised Statutes of that state, relied upon, and it has been held that re- \n\n[194 U.S. 517, 538]\n\u00a0\n newals may be made before the expiration of the original grant. State ex rel. Hadden v. Fast Cleveland R. Co. 6 Ohio C. C. 318, affirmed by the supreme court of Ohio without opinion, 27 Ohio L. J. 64.\n Concluding, as we do, that the ordinance of 1898 impaired the obligations of contracts entered into by the city of Cleveland fixing the rate of fare to be charged on the lines of railroad operated by the complainant, the decree of the Circuit Court adjudging the nullity of this ordinance was right, and it is therefore affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan took no part in the decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n Copied from Bates' Annotated Statutes of Ohio-Revision of 1897.\n Sec. 2501.

CLEVELAND ELECTRIC R CO(1904)\nNo. 256\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Newton D. Baker and D. C. Westenhaver for appellant.\n Mr. William B. Sanders for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is analogous in the facts shown by the record to \n\n[194 U.S. 538, 539]\n\u00a0\n the one just decided (Cleveland v. Cleveland City R. Co. 194 U. S. --, ante, p. 756, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756), and presents identical questions of law.\n We shall briefly advert to some only of the material facts.\n An ordinance was passed by the city council of Cleveland in 1879, granting a renewal of franchise to the East Cleveland Railroad Company, and in  6 of the ordinance it was provided as follows:\n'Said company shall not charge more than 5 cents fare each way for one passenger over the whole or any part of the line herein renewed, but said company may charge a reasonable compensation for carrying packages. The council, however, reserves the right to hereafter increase or diminish the rate of fare, as it may deem justifiable and expedient.'\n\n By ordinances duly accepted, passed in 1886, 1888, and 1889, extensions were authorized, thorized, the right was given to doubletrack portions of the line, the franchise was extended, and additional obligations were assumed by the railroad company in respect to paving, etc. It was expressly stipulated in the ordinances of 1886 and 1887 that the company should charge and collect for passage over its lines in either direction but one fare, of not more than 5 cents; there was no reservation of the future right to alter rates of fare; and it was agreed that the rights conferred should continue during the life of the franchise.\n In 1893 the East Cleveland Railroad Company was consolidated with three other corporations, independent lines of railway, in the city of Cleveland, each of them operating under contracts or grants from the city, and charging, as authorized in the ordinance permitting their operation, a cash fare of 5 cents. As to no one of these companies was there any right remaining in the city council to increase or diminish the rate of fare during the period of the several grants. The fare then being charged by all the constituent companies was 5 cents. Since the consolidation the system has been operated in its entirety, and but a single fare of 5 cents has been charged.\n On October 17, 1898, the city council of Cleveland passed \n\n[194 U.S. 538, 540]\n\u00a0\n an ordinance reducing the cash fare to be charged by the complainant on the portion of its line affected by the ordinance of 1879 to 4 cents, and required seven tickets to be sold for 25 cents. The validity of this ordinance was assailed by the bill filed in this cause, and similar contentions were urged against its constitutionality as are contained in the bill filed in the suit brought by the Cleveland Railway Company. Like jurisdictional objections were also interposed in this case by the city of Cleveland as were raised in the other case.\n The circuit court granted a motion for judgment upon the pleadings, and decreed that the ordinance of 1898 was void because it impaired the obligations of prior contracts. 94 Fed. 385. The principles applied in the case of the Cleveland City Railway Company, just decided, govern this case, and, as a result, the decree of the Circuit Court must be, and it is, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan took no part in the decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF SAN JUAN v. ST JOHN'S GAS CO(1904)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n The gas company, defendant in error, an English corporation, sued the city of San Juan, the plaintiff in error, to recover $14,600.60, alleged to be due for services in lighting 485 street lamps from November, 1899, to September 16, 1900. Annexed to the petition was an account showing the items from which the balance resulted. The city generally denied, and pleaded that, under the contract for lighting, it had at various times imposed fines upon the company for neglect of its contract duty, which fines were a set-off, and extinguished the sum sued for. A statement of account was also filed by the city, showing the alleged set-off. Both the accounts credited the gas company for lighting with $15,125.70. In the account of the gas company, that company credited itself with several small items for labor and materials supplied to, and materials appropriated by, the city, aggregating $246.42, and for interest calculated at 12 per cent up to September 16, 1901, the items in question and the interest amounting to $2,215.96, making the total credited to the company $17,588.08. These sums were not in the account of the city. Whilst the credit items in both accounts, therefore, agreed except as above stated, there was this further difference: The account of the gas company stated that the sums to its credit were payable in gold or United States money; whilst the account of the city stated such items as payable in Porto Rican currency, declared to be worth 40 per cent less than United States gold or currency. The gas company debited itself with various payments made to it by the city on account of the services rendered and for the sum of a certain ground rent, all amounting to $2,987.42, leaving in its favor the balance sued for. The city's account, whilst debiting the company with payments in United States gold to the amount stated in the gas company's account, treated the debt as being due in Porto Rican currency, and figured the payments in gold as extinguishing a larger amount by 40 per cent than the face value \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n of the gold. In addition the gas company was debited with certain fines imposed and other charges, and was moreover debited in Porto Rican money with two sums aggregating $8,836.88, amounting, if paid in gold, to $5,332. 13. These two debits, it was recited in the account, were the sums in Porto Rican money or its equivalent in gold, which the city was bound to pay to the firm of Mullenhoff & Korber, to which firm the gas company, with the consent of the city, had transferred a portion of its claims against the city in Porto Rican money, to be paid in its equivalent in gold. By the result of the debits against the gas company the items credited to it were extinuished and the account balanced. Thus, the substantial difference between the two accounts arose from the fact that one stated the debt to be payable in gold or United States money, the other treated it as payable in Porto Rican currency.\n Subsequently, the city pleaded that it had paid to Mullenhoff & Korber the sum of $5,196.80 in United States gold, and was entitled to due credit therefor, and it was thereafter agreed between counsel that this amount had been paid under the transfer in question. As will hereafter appear, $4,337.32 of the sum was paid as the equivalent of $7,228.20 in Porto Rican currency, the amount due for street lighting up to June 1, 1900, if estimated in Porto Rico, while the balance of $859.48 was paid as satisfying the charge made for street lighting in the month of June, 1900, also consisting of a larger sum in Porto Rican money.\n At the trial the undisputed proof showed that in 1875 the city made a contract, to last for twenty-five years, with one Steinacher for the lighting of the city, which contract, about 1878, was assigned to the gas company; that shortly after there was a difference between the parties as to whether the sums due under the contract were payable in Porto Rican money or in current foreign money. As a result, all the payments up to and exclusive of the items embraced in the suit were received by the gas company, under protest, in Porto Rican currency. So far as any payments made on account of the \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n items embraced in the suit and stated in both accounts, it was undisputedly shown that they were made in United States gold. There was proof tending to show that the city, in making them, insisted that the gold should extinguish its equivalent amount in Porto Rican currency, whilst the company claimed that the payments should only extinguish a sum equal to the face value of the United States gold.\n Concerning the transfer to the firm of Mullenhoff & Korber, and the payment made by the city to that firm, it was indisputably shown as follows: That the gas company, being in want of funds, had agreed to transfer to the firm a given portion of its claim, and applied to the city to recognize the assignment, and to pay to the transferees the sum assigned, and that action was taken on this request by the city, and was accepted in writing by Scott, representing gas company, as follows:\n I, Ramon Negron Flores, secretary of the city council of the city of San Juan, hereby certify, that at the meeting held by the city council of San Juan, on the eighteenth day of this month, the following resolution was passed:\n 20.-The president of the city council declared that Mr. Scott, the contractor of the public lighting for the city, and Mr. Korber, a member of the firm of Mullenhoff and Korber of this city, had called on his office and stated that the amount of seven thousand two hundred and twenty- eight pesos and eighty-seven cents, Porto Rican currency, total amount of the credit due to Mr. Scott, on account of his services as contractor from November of the year one thousand eight hundred ninety-nine, to last May, being deducted the amounts already collected by the said contractor, should be delivered to the above said firm, to the credit of which Mr. Scott wishes this amount to be passed.\n The city council agreed with the declarations of the president, and passed the resolution considering the said balance of seven thousand two hundred and twenty-eight pesos with eighty cents equivalent of four thousand three hundred and \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n thirty-seven dollars and thirty-two cents in favor of the firm Mullenhoff & Korber, being therefore the municipal corporation relieved from any compromise with Mr. Scott concerning the said amount, without any prejudice to the resolutions to be passed some time in the future, about the claims previously filed by the said contractor.\n And to begin the respective proceedings, I write and sign this declaration in San Juan of Puerto Rico this twenty-second day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred.\n (Signed) R. Negron.\n On twenty-second June, being present Mr. Scott and Mr. Korber, the latter acting as representative of the firm, of which he is a partner, I notified them the above resolution, and they affixed their signature as a proof of their acquiescence to the same, declaring at the same time, that the amount of the account of the month of June of this year should be recognized as due to the same firm, to which the said amount must be paid. I certify it.\n (Signed) R. Negron.\n (Signed) Mullenhoff & Korber.\n (Signed) L. A. Scott.\n San Juan, June 19th, 1900\n\n\n Let it be done. The Mayor, Egozcue.\n There was testimony, admitted without objection, tending to show that at the time the city accepted this transfer it was understood that the reservation made in the written agreement related only to fines which it was contended the city had unjustly imposed on the company. The court rejected the offer of the city to prove that the parties, by their conduct prior to the period covered by the items sued for, had interpreted the contract as meaning that the payments were to be made in Porto Rican money, and not otherwise. The court also refused to instruct, at the request of the city, that the contract was payable in Porto Rican money, and charged that \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n it provided for payment in foreign money, exclusive of Spanish gold, which was current in the island at the time the contract was made. The court further instructed that the payments made by the city of Mullenhoff & Korber in gold should be debited to the city at the face value of those payments, unless the jury found that the minds of the parties had met on a new contract to substitute Porto Rican currency for the foreign current money stipulated by the contract. The court, moreover, refused the request of the city to charge that if, at the time of the transfer to Mullenhoff & Korber, there was a compromise entered into between the parties by which the payment to the firm of a given amount in United States currency should extinguish a larger amount of the debt due the company in Porto Rican money, that the parties were bound thereby, as to such payment. Besides, the jury were instructed that, as there was no proof concerning the fines imposed by the city upon the company, as stated in the account of the city, such items must be disregarded, and that interest, as calculated in the account of the city, not being exigible under the local law, must also be disregarded.\n There was a verdict and judgment thereon against the city for $8,761. 35, and this writ of error was prosecuted.\n Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, Francis H. Dexter, and John Spalding Flannery for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In order to come to the principal controversy covered by the assignments of error we dispose of certain contentions which we deem of minor importance. We think the court was right in instructing the jury that it must disregard the \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n items as to fines charged by the city against the gas company, because no proof was offered on the subject. Whilst it is true, as asserted in the argument, that some reference was made to such fines in the testimony of one or more of the witnesses, such reference in no sense tended to establish that the fines had been legally imposed. As to the assignment of error relating to the refusal of the court to allow testimony for the purpose of showing that even if, under the contract, payment in foreign current money was required, the contract was tacitly modified, we deem it unnecessary to express an opinion, for the following reasons: The record shows that, subsequent to the ruling complained of, without objection, testimony was admitted establishing that, although all the payments made up to the first of the items embraced in the claim in suit, were made by the city to the gas company in Porto Rican money, nevertheless that such payments were only received by the gas company under protest, asserting its right to be paid in foreign current money. However conclusive on the gas company may have been the receipt by it of payment in a different medium from that which it asserted the contract required, the fact of the protest operated to prevent the inference that the medium actually received was admitted to be the one in which future payments should be made.\n With the questions just referred to out of the way, it is apparent from the statement which we have made of the case that the record requires us to decide only two questions: First, in what money were the sums due under the contract payable? and, second, the effect of the agreement concerning payment made by the city to Mullenhorf & Korber.\n 1st. In what carrency were the sums due under the contract payable?\n The contract, of which only a translation is in the record, was passed before a notary, and is voluminous, containing in minute detail a recital of all the occurrences which took place from the date of the first steps taken to make a contract, and its consummation. \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n Excluding irrelevant details, it appears as follows:\n Some time in 1874 the city advertised for bids for a contract for lighting. Proposals were received from a Mr. Steinacher and Mr. Olney. Steinacher, whilst proposing to bind himself to light lamps for $3 monthly for each lamp, suggested that the city modify its request for proposals in several particulars, one of which was that there should be included in the contract the purchase by the contractor of gas works then owned by the city. This suggestion was accepted, and preparatory to making a call for bids, after obtaining the authority of the provincial deputation of Porto Rico, the city directed that the gas works be appraised by certain city officials. This appraisement was made as follows:\n Recapitulation: Pesetas. Value of the buildings 19,176.25 Fixed and loose materials in the gas works 48,908.85 Fixed materials in the city 10,624.00\n Total amount 78,709.10\n The present appraisement amounting to 78,709.10 pesetas, or $31,741. 82 of the currency in commerce.\n Porto Rico, 26th of May,1875.\n The municipal architect.\n (Signed) Domingo Sesmero.\n The city thereupon called for new proposals. Among the many conditions exacted were, first, that the bidder should agree to light street lamps at $3 monthly for each lamp, and that payment for the same 'will be made in the circulating foreign money in commerce for the value that it is received without any premium that will equalize it to the Spanish official current money;' that he should buy the gas works, appraised, as we have above stated, at $78,709.10, Porto Rico money, at its equivalent in foreign currency,-$31,741.82; that the bidder should furnish a guarantee of $6,000 in cash or a bond for \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n $9,000, TO BE SECURED BY FIRST MORTGAGE On a house in the city, satisfactory to the municipality. Many details were provided in the conditions; as to the manner in which the contractor should perform his duties; as to fines to be imposed by the city for neglect in the quality and character of the light furnished, and for various other delinquencies, and it was also provided 'the penalties for faults in the service and supply of gas to the public will be imposed by the alcalde without appeal.'\n Steinacher was the only bidder in answer to this call for proposals. He offered 'to take charge of the city service for the amount of $3 currency for each lamp,' and to buy the buildings and apparatus, etc., for the sum of $22,000 in currency, instead of $31,741.82, as required by the requests for bids made by the city. In his proposition, moreover, Steinacher tendered two houses, stating the fact to be that one of them was encumbered by a prior mortgage in favor of the municipality, which he, Steinacher, had given to guarantee a prior contract existing between himself and the municipality. In addition, his bid suggested various modifications in the administrative provisions enumerated by the city in its conditions. The bid, not being in accord with the proposition submitted by the city, was rejected. Negotiations then ensued, the result of which was that the city yielded as to the administrative provisions, and Steinacher yielded as to the price to be paid for the gas works, it being recited in the proceedings of the city on the subject that, in order to terminate the difficulties, 'Mr. Steinacher expresses himself disposed to the acquisition of the said buildings, etc., as published in the Official Gazette of the 8th of June last, for the amount of $31,741.82 in currency, and to take under his charge the public light at $3 monthly for each lamp, at same currency, according to the price published.' The houses tendered to secure the bond were accepted by the city, and, in order to give the city a first mortgage, a liquidation was had between Stein- \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n acher and the city under the prior contract, and by this liquidation it was established that Steinacher owed the city $203 in 'foreign currency,' which he paid. To ascertain whether the value of the houses was equal to the requirements of the city, they were appraised by the city officials in Porto Rican money, and this sum was reduced to foreign currency, and, as the amount in foreign currency equaled the $9,000 required by the conditions of the city, the houses were accepted and a new mortgage for that amount was given. Under these proposals and acceptance the contract was executed, conforming in all respects to the proposals and bids as modified by the proceedings which we have narrated.\n The contention that the $3 per month for lighting street lamps was payable in Porto Rican money is based on the fact that sometimes in the contract the sum to be paid is referred to as in currency, without any qualification. The arguments would have cogency if the passages in the contract relied upon stood alone; but its unsoundness becomes apparent by a consideration of the context of the contract. The estimate of the property to be sold in Porto Rican money and its liquidation in foreign currency; the terms of the bid; the proposition of Steinacher, which was accepted, to pay for the gas works at the sum of the foreign current money to which the Porto Rican money was reduced, and to do the lighting at $3 per lamp in the same currency; the action of the city concerning the liquidation of the prior account, and the mortgage upon the house,-all demonstrate that both the proposals of the city, the acceptance by Steinacher, and the contract fixed current foreign money, exclusive of Spanish gold, as the medium in which the service for lighting the street lamps was to be paid. The court, therefore, was right in its instruction as to the medium of payment required by the contract. We find, however, nothing in the contract to support the construction that it required the payment to be made in foreign current money circulating in the island at the time the contract was made, instead of money of that character circulating at the time \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n the payments were to be made. The general rule, under both the common and the civil law, is that, in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary, the character of money which is current at the time fixed for performance of a contract is the medium in which payments may be made. Butler v. Horwitz, 7 Wall. 258, 19 L. ed. 149; Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557, 19 L. ed. 501; Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. 687, 20 L. ed. 460; Commercial Code of Porto Rico, art. 312; Spanish Civil Code of Porto Rico, arts. 1091, 1157, 1170; Code Napoleon, art. 1246; Aubrey & Rau, vol. 4, p. 158; Mourlon, vol. 2, p. 749.\n There was, therefore, error in instructing that the time of making the contract was to be alone considered in determining the foreign current money for which the contract provided. We think, however, such error was in no sense prejudicial. This follows, because it was conceded that, if foreign current money was required by the contract, money of the United States current at the time the contract was made was within the contemplation of the parties, and that such money was also current in the island at the time when performance was due. From this it results that the rights of the parties were in no way affected by the erroneous ruling.\n 2d. The effect of the agreement concerning the payment made by the city to Mullenhoff & Korber.\n On the face of the written agreement between the city and the gas company it undoubtedly appears that a stated sum of money, to be paid in United States currency, was to extinguish a larger sum in Porto Rican money.\n As we have seen, there was testimony tenging to show, and none tending otherwise, that the reservation in the written document concerning 'claims previously filed by the said contractor,' and which were to be 'passed some time in the future,' solely related to claims for fines which the city had assessed against the gas company, and the justice of which the company disputed. The city asked the court to instruct that if it was found that at the time of the agreement it was stipulated by way of compromise that the larger sum owing \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 521]\n\u00a0\n at the time should be extinguished by the payment of the lesser amount, the parties were bound. This request was refused and excepted to. The court, in its general charge, in the fullest manner instructed the jury that, as the medium of payment required by the contract was foreign current money, payment in that money extinguished simply the amount paid in foreign money, unless it was found that the minds of the parties had met on an agreement engendering an entirely new contract, substituting Porto Rican money for foreign currency.\n It is urged by the city that error to its prejudice resulted from refusing to give the requested instruction. To sustain this proposition the doctrine is invoked that where one receives in payment a different thing or medium from that called for in the contract, such receipt is binding. Undoubtedly the general rule obtains, and is based on the premise that the discharge of a contract in a different thing from that for which the contract provides, necessarily is an accord and satisfaction as to the particular payment concerning which the different thing is received. Sheehy v. Mandeville, 6 Cranch, 263, 3 L. ed. 218; Very v. Levy, 13 How. 357, 14 L. ed. 179; Bull v. Bull, 43 Conn. 455; Neal v. Handley, 116 Ill. 418, 56 Am. Rep. 784, 6 N. E. 45; Dimmick v. Sexton, 125 Pa. 334, 17 Atl. 345.\n True also is it that it has been settled by this court (Savage v. United States, \n92 U.S. 382\n, 23 L. ed. 660) that this doctrine is applicable to the receipt under protest, in discharge of a particular payment, of a different money medium from that which was required by the contract. Whilst we have not been referred to any Spanish authority showing that these principles obtained under the law in force in Porto Rico, as the doctrine rests upon principles known to the Roman law (L. 17, C. De Solut.) enforced under the Code Napoleon (Journal de Palais Repertoire, v. 10, verbo paiement, p. 10, No. 117; Toulier, t. 12, p. 355; Duranton, t. 12, Nos. 79 and 80), we cannot hesitate to conclude that the doctrine in question prevailed also in the Spanish civil law in force in Porto Rico. Whether it is applicable to the facts of this case is, then, the question. \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 522]\n\u00a0\n Now, whilst it may be at once conceded that the doctrine in question is applicable to the payments made in Porto Rican money before the date of the first item sued for, it is equally clear that it cannot be applied to the payments thereafter made, including those to Mullenhoff & Korber, since they were made in United States ourrency. The contention that these payments in such money extinguished a larger sum than the par value of the money paid reduces itself to this: that a larger sum was satisfied by the payment of a lesser sum, because there was an agreement to that effect. The gas company in effect insists that this cannot be sustained, because of the well-established rule 'that where a liquidated sum is due, the payment of a less sum in satisfaction thereof, though accepted as satisfaction, is not binding as such, for want of consideration.' Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Clark, \n178 U.S. 364\n, 44 L. ed. 1105, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 928, and authorities there cited.\n Conceding, without so deciding, that such rule was controlling in Porto Rico, we think it is not applicable to the case in hand. As pointed out by this court in the case just previously cited, the rule in question is subject, among others, to the wellestablished exception that it does not apply where, at the time of the agreement, there was a dispute between the parties, the subject-matter of which dispute is embraced in the agreement to extinguish a greater by a less amount. True it is, as pointed out in Fire Ins. Asso. v. Wickham, \n141 U.S. 564\n, 35 L. ed. 860, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 84, it must appear that the alleged dispute really existed, and did not arise merely from an arbitrary denial by one party of an obligation which was obviously due. Despite the construction which we have given the contract, we think it is quite clear that the proof established that there was a bona fide dispute in this case. As we have seen, from the very inception of the contract the parties differed as to the medium of payment,-the one, the city, insisting that it was Porto Rican money; the other, the gas company, that it was foreign current money. During a period of fully twenty years this controversy continued, and in every instance the gas \n\n[195 U.S. 510, 523]\n\u00a0\n company, although protesting, accepted the city's view of the contract, and, by taking a different medium, bound itself as to those payments despite its protest. When the period arrived when the company was no longer willing to so act, and stood upon its rights as it understood them, naturally the city stood upon its asserted rights, and thus the parties were at arm's length, disputing their respective rights. If there had been no argeement, the solution would have required judicial action. When, in view of this dispute, an agreement was reached that the payment should be made in United States currency, and that the payment should extinguish a larger amount estimated in Porto Rican currency, there was necessarily a compromise and settlement as to that payment which put the transaction so settled exactly in the position which had resulted from the action of the parties concerning the payments made during the preceding period of more than twenty years.\n It follows from the foregoing that the court below erred to the prejudice of the city in refusing the instruction asked by it as to the result of the compromise, and that this error was not cured by the general charge, which instructed the jury that the compromise evidenced by the agreement must be treated as inefficacious as to the particular items to which it related unless it was found that the minds of the parties had met on an entirely new and independent contract.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to set aside the judgment, and grant a new trial.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF SEATTLE v. KELLEHER(1904)\nNo. 29\nArgued: October 28, 1904Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Mitchell Gilliam and Walter Fulton for appellant.[ City of Seattle v. Kelleher \n195 U.S. 351\n (1904) ]\n\n\n[195 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick Bausman, Daniel Kelleher, and G. Meade Emory for appellee. \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the circuit court, declaring an assessment upon the plaintiff's land void under the 14th Amendment, and enjoining the city against enforcing the same. The facts are these: Weller street, in Seattle, runs east from Elliott bay, and formerly stopped at the east line of Maynard's donation claim. The land now belonging to the appellee, the plaintiff below, is 100 acres to the east of that line, extending to the line of the Jackson street addition. Weller street, if extended eastward, would run through the middle of this land for 2,500 feet. While this land belonged to one Hill, in 1889, he petitioned that Weller street be extended and graded to the Jackson street addition line, and he submitted to the city council, and circulated, although he did not record, plans \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n showing the extension, with his land on the two sides of it divided into lots and blocks. The plan was approved, and in 1890 the city passed an ordinance that Weller street be graded from the beginning to Jackson street addition, and that sidewalks be constructed on both sides of it, coextensive with the grade. Ordinance No. 1285. The street was graded, and, according to the testimony, had to be cut and filled almost continuously. It also was planked for some distance, but the planking stopped about 1, 000 feet before reaching Hill's tract. Then an assessment was levied, but this was held void. The next things that happened were a sale of Hill's land and a mortgage of it in January, 1892, to the appellee, which later was foreclosed. The appellee, who lived out of the state, alleges that he was ignorant of the submission of the plan by Hill.\n On March 9, 1893, an act was approved authorizing a new assessment, when the old one had been declared void, upon the lands benefited, to the extent of their proportionate part of the expense of the improvement, based upon its actual value at the time of its completion, and having reference to the benefits received. Notice by publication of a time for hearing objections was provided for, with an appeal to the courts. Laws of 1893, chap. 95. When the improvement in question was ordered, by the charter of Seattle the planking was to be paid for out of the general taxes. Laws of 1885-1886, pp. 238, 241,  7. The special assessment for the other elements, according to the assessed value of the land, could be imposed upon the abutting property to 128 feet back from the street. This was modified by a new charter, adopted later in 1890, and still in force. Under the latter the assessment was to be by the front foot, with different percentages for four parallel subdivisions at successive distances from the street up to 120 feet. It was to be for the costs of the improvement. To carry out the plan, local improvement districts were to be established, including all the property within the termini of the improvement, and \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n not more than 120 feet on each side of the margin. Reassessments were authorized. In pursuance of the charter an ordinance was adopted by the city, providing the manner in which the local assessment should be made. Ordinance No. 2085\n\n\n In this state of the ordinances and laws a reassessment of the whole cost of the improvement was ordered in January, 1894, in conformity with the act of 1893, the new charter, and the ordinance No. 2085. Ordinance No. 3199. The proper steps were taken and the assessment was confirmed on March 5, 1894. Ordinance No. 3267. By this assessment the whole cost of the improvement, $35,620.60, was levied on the abutting land, and $14,262. 68 was fixed as the plaintiff's share. It is alleged that he thus is charged 44 per cent under the present plan, whereas under the one in force when the improvement was made he would have been charged only 32 per cent. It also is alleged that, being absent from the state, he did not know of the reassessment proceedings until they were concluded.\n The bill disputed, among other things, that the prolongation of Weller street through the plaintiff's land ever had been dedicated as a street. But, in view of the assumption by the circuit court that the dedication was made out, and the statement by it that the point had been decided by the supreme court of the state, this objection, if open, very properly was not pressed before us. See Seattle v. Hill, 23 Wash. 92, 62 Pac. 446. Therefore we have not gone into details upon that part of the case. We see no cause to doubt that the circuit court was right. The main ground of argument is that the planking could not be included in the assessment. The reasons, as summed up by the circuit court, are that the law in force at the time of doing the work did not authorize a charge for planking upon the abutting property, that the ordinance No. 1285, ordering the improvement, did not authorize any planking, that the city could assess only the land abutting on the improvement, and the plaintiff's land was far away from \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n the planking, and that such an assessment of the whole cost, including the planking, on the property on Weller street, is absolutely unfair as to the plaintiff's land.\n A general attack upon the statute of 1893 is not attempted. It was within the power of the legislature to create, or to authorize the creation of, special taxing districts, and to charge the cost of a local improvement upon the property in such a district by frontage. Websler v. Fargo, \n181 U.S. 394\n, 45 L. ed. 912, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 623; French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 U.S. 324\n, 45 L. ed. 879, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625; McNamee v. Tacoma, 24 Wash. 591, 595, 64 Pac. 791; Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 729. The only question of principle, therefore, raised by the inclusion of the planking in the sum of which the plaintiff was to pay his share, is whether it was manifestly unfair in this particular case. Taken by itself it looks like an unwarrantable attempt to make one man pay for another man's convenience.\n On the other hand, so far as the work was similar in character throughout the street, we are of opinion that the improvement might be regarded as one. Webster v. Fargo, \n181 U.S. 394\n, 45 L. ed. 912, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 623. See Lincoln v. Street Comrs. 176 Mass. 210, 212, 57 N. E. 356. And if this be admitted we cannot say that the assessing board might not have been warranted in thinking that substantial justice was done. There were many cuts and fills made in grading the road. So far as appears, the heaviest work may have been done on the plaintiff's land, which seems to have been the summit of an ascent. Improvement of one sort may have been the greatest there, while that of a different kind, needed where the travel was, was at the other end of the street. It is true that the circuit judge considered that there was manifest injustice in assessing the plaintiff's land, which was empty and unimproved, by the front foot at the same rate as the improved land lower down and nearer to the bay, and that his opinion naturally carries weight, from his probable acquaintance with the condition of the place. But we do not find a sufficient warrant for it on the record. We must consider how things looked at the time. The owner of the land desired the improvements, if carried out \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n as he wished. The extension of the street helped to bring his land into the market. It was more likely to benefit him than those who were lower down. We cannot invalidate the assessment because the speculation has failed. Assuming, without deciding, that the question is open to the plaintiff in this proceeding, we are of opinion that the record does not justify interference by injunction on the ground that the assessment was manifestly unfair.\n The answer to the other objections may be made in few words. If, as is said, planking was not authorized under the word 'sidewalks' in ordinance No. 1285, the city has done or adopted the work, and presumably has paid for it. At the end the benefit was there, on the ground, at the city's expense. The principles of taxation are not those of contract. A special assessment may be levied upon an executed consideration, that is to say, for a public work already done. Bellows v. Weeks, 41 Vt. 590, 599, 600; Mills v. Charleton, 29 Wis. 400, 413, 9 Am. Rep. 578; Hall v. Street Comrs. 177 Mass. 434, 439, 59 N. E. 68. If this were not so it might be hard to justify reassessments. See Norwood v. Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269, 293\n, 43 S. L. ed. 443, 452, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187; Williams v. Albany, \n122 U.S. 154\n, 30 L. ed. 1088, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1244; Frederick v. Seattle, 13 Wash. 428, 43 Pac. 364; Cline v. Seattle, 13 Wash. 444, 43 Pac. 367; Bacon v. Seattle, 15 Wash. 701, 47 Pac. 1102; Cooley, Taxn. 3d ed. 1280. The same answer is sufficient if it be true that when the work was done the cost of planking could not be included in the special assessment, which again depends on the meaning of the words 'sidewalk' and 'pave' in the old charter,  8, taken with the special provision for planking in  7. Laws of 1885-1886, pp. 238, 241. The charge of planking on the general taxes was not a contract with the landowners, and no more prevented a special assessment being authorized for it later than silence of the laws at the same time as to how it should be paid for would have. In either case the legislature could do as it thought best. Of course, it does not matter that this is called a reassessment. A reassessment may be a new assessment. Whatever the legislature \n\n[195 U.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n could authorize if it were ordering an assessment for the first time it equally could authorize, notwithstanding a previous invalid attempt to assess. The previous attempt left the city free 'to take such steps as were within its power to take, either under existing statutes, or under any authority that might thereafter be conferred upon it, to make a new assessment upon the plaintiff's abutting property' in any constitutional way. Norwood v. Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269, 293\n, 43 S. L. ed. 443, 452, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187, 196; McNamee v. Tacoma, 24 Wash. 591, 64 Pac. 791; Annie Wright Seminary v. Tacoma, 23 Wash. 109, 62 Pac. 444.\n We think it unnecessary to consider other questions on the part of the case that we have dealt with. We have said enough in our opinion to show that the enforcement of the assessment lien could not be prevented by the original owner. It is urged, however, that a different rule could be applied in favor of one who purchased the land under the circumstances stated above. But the attempt to liken taxation, whether general or special, to the enforcement of a vendor's lien, and thus to introduce the doctrine concerning bona fide purchasers for value, rests on a fallacy similar to that which we have mentioned above, which would deny the right to tax upon an executed consideration. A man cannot get rid of his liability to a tax by buying without notice. See Tallman v. Janesville, 17 Wis. 71, 76; Cooley, Taxn. 3d ed. 527, 528. Indeed, he cannot buy without notice, since the liability is one of the notorious incidents of social life. In this case the road was cut through the plaintiff's land, and, if he had looked, was visible upon the ground. Whether it had been paid for was for him to inquire. The history of what had happened would have suggested that it was not improbable that sooner or later a payment must be made.\n Decree reversed.\n On January 3, 1905, Mr. Justice Holmes announced that the decree of November 28, 1904, was modified by striking out the order to dismiss the bill, and by remanding the cause for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Brown dissent. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLIFF v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2,228), amended May 9, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 193, chap. 784). 1 A jud ___ $50, as prescribed by the section, was entered, with an order for collection by execution. That judgment was brought directly to this court by writ of error. The constitutionality of the oleomargarine legislation and the right to waive a trial by jury in petty criminal offenses were affirmed in McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 49 L. ed. 78, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, and Schick v. United States, \n195 U.S. 65\n, 49 L. ed. 99, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826. Nothing need be added to the opinions in those cases on these questions.\n There is in this case a further question. Section 2 reads:\n'Sec. 2. That for the purposes of this act certain manufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine,' namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, vegetable oil annotto and other coloring matter, intestinal fat and offal fat made in imitation or semblance of butter, or, when so made, caloulated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter.'\n\n In  8 is this provision:\n'Sec. 8. That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured and sold, or removed for consumption or use, there shall be assessed and collected a tax of ten cents per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and any fractional part of a pound in a package shall be taxed as a pound: Provided, When oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow said tax shall be one fourth of one cent per pound.'\n\n By  14 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue-- 'is authorized to decide what substances, extracts, mixtures, or\n 1 U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1903, p. 266. \n\n[195 U.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n compounds, which may be submitted for his inspection in contested cases, are to be taxed under this act; and his decision in matters of taxation under this act shall be final. The Commissioner may also decide whether any substance made in imitation or semblance of butter, and intended for human consumption, contains ingredients deleterious to the public health.'\n Defendant was charged with having knowingly purchased and received for sale 'certain oleomargarine which had not been stamped according to law,-that is to say, 10 pounds of a mixture and compound composed, as he, the said August Cliff, well knew, of oleo oil, neutral lard, cotton-seed oil, milk, common salt, and palm oil (which said last-named ingredient, to wit, palm oil, produced an artificial coloration in the said oleomargarine that caused it to look like butter of a shade of yellow), which said oleomargarine had then lately before, to wit, on the day aforesaid, been manufactured at Chicago aforesaid by William J. Moxley.'\n It was shown that the tax of 10 cents per pound had not been paid, that the package contained 10 pounds, that its ingredients and their proportions were: 3 pounds of oleo oil; 1 pound and 12 ounces of neutral lard; 2 pounds of cotton-seed oil; 1 pound and 14 1\/2 ounces of milk; 1 pound and 4 ounces of salt; 1 1\/2 ounces of palm oil. In other words, out of 160 ounces, only 1 1\/2 ounces were palm oil. There was introduced in evidence a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as follows:\n'This office rules that where so minute and infinitesimal a quantity of a vegetable oil is used in the manufacture of oleomargarine as is proposed to be used of palm oil, and through its use the finished product looks like butter of any shade of yellow, it cannot be considered that the oil is used with the purpose or intention of being a bona fide constituent part or element of the product, but is used solely for the purpose of producing or imparting a yellow color to the oleomargarine, \n\n[195 U.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n and, therefore, that the oleomargarine so colored is not free from artificial coloration, and becomes subject to the tax of 10 cents per pound.'\n\n Now the contention is that, Congress having by  2 named the possible ingredients of oleomargarine, the coloring given to a compound of some or all by the use of one of the named ingredients is a natural coloring, and not an artificial coloration, subjecting to a tax of 10 cents per pound. In order that the precise contention may be understood we quote the following from one of the briefs filed for plaintiff in error:\n'By parity of reasoning, when one is speaking of oleomargarine, natural coloration means a coloration due to a natural ingredient of oleomargarine; and to find out whether a certain ingredient is a natural ingredient of oleomargarine, we turn to the statute which defines the nature of oleomargarine. If the color-giving ingredient be a natural, that is a statutory, ingredient of oleomargarine, then how can it be truly said that the color caused by such ingredient is 'artificial coloration' merely because the quantity of such ingredient used is small or even minute, and the purpose of its use is to impart the desired color? Howsoever minute may be the quantity of palm oil used, it is none the less a vegetable oil, a statutory, or, so to speak, a natural, ingredient of oleomargarine, and displaces in the finished product an equal volume of some other statutory ingredient of oleomargarine; as, for instance, cotton-seed oil. The statute confers no power upon the Commissioner to prescribe the formula for the manufacture of oleomargarine, or the proportion of the different ingredients, or to exclude any ingredient except upon the ground of its being deleterious to health. But does not the government, in effect, assume such power to be in the Commissioner, when, by reason of his arbitrary classification, based upon the quantity of palm oil used, it requires a tax of 10 cents per pound upon oleomargarine containing a small or minute proportion of palm oil, while, if the percentage used of that oil were large enough to constitute what the Commissioner would regard as a sub- \n\n[195 U.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n stantial part of the finished product, it is conceded that the tax would be only 1\/4 of a cent per pound?'\n\n We do not undervalue the force of this argument, but, as applied to this case, hold that it cannot prevail. It is true that under the last clause of  2 oleomargarine includes 'all mixtures and compounds' of the substances named, 'made in imitation or semblance of butter, or, when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter,' and that palm oil is a vegetable oil, one of those substances. But in this enumeration Congress included not only those substances which, entering into the composition of oleomargarine, make it suitable for food, and, so to speak, form its body, but also others used only for coloring. After naming some it adds specifically, 'and other coloring matter.' The purpose in so including 'coloring matter' is obvious. It was to prevent excluding from the operation of the statute anything in its nature oleomargarine by the addition of a substance not in reality an ingredient, but serving substantially only the purpose of coloring the product to cause it to look like butter. The fact that one of the ingredients of this compound is palm oil does not show that such oil does anything else than color the product composed of other ingredients, and if it does substantially only this, it is rightfully styled an artificial coloration. Otherwise the proviso practically nullifies the body of the section. For 'other coloring matter' includes all coloring matter; at least, all of the nature of those named; and hence the addition of any coloring matter would produce only a natural, and not an artificial, coloration, and thus relieve the product from the 10-cent tax. It will be noted that the regular tax imposed upon oleomargarine by  8 is 10 cents a pound, the exception thereto being stated in the proviso, and a party who claims the benefit thereof must make it clear that his oleomargarine is within its scope. That exception is 'when oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow.' Bearing in mind, also, that one of the purposes of this legisla- \n\n[195 U.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n tion was to prevent the sale of oleomargarine as and for butter, it must be held that when any substance, although named as a possible ingredient of oleomargarine, substantially serves only the function of coloring the mass, and so as to cause the product to 'look like butter of any shade of yellow,' it is an artificial coloration.\n Whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has all the authority which is in terms committed to him by  14 need not be determined. The letter containing his ruling was admitted in evidence without objection. Irrespective of such ruling, and upon the other testimony, the judge who tried the case, and whose decision must be considered as equivalent to the verdict of a jury, could rightfully have found that this package of oleomargarine was artificially colored by the small amount of palm oil used in its manufacture. A witness testified that he called at the place of business of the defendant, 'and found this 10-pound package of oleomargarine, which had been colored with palm oil to a very decided shade of yellow, like natural June butter, bearing a tax-paid stamp of 1\/4 of a cent a pound.' Other witnesses testified to the exact per dent of palm oil used in the preparation of the package. One said that 'the article so manufactured was according to a formula used in the course of business, with the exception of the palm oil. It is what we call the 'Daisy grade,'-the lower grade. It is a substitute for butter.' Another testified that 'a very small proportion of palm oil is necessary only to produce what is considered a desirable color in oleomargarine. The color of palm oil is a reddish yellow. Its natural color is such that it may be used to make oleomargarine or white substances to look like butter.' Further, the defendant offered quite an amount of testimony, which was received by the court, and afterwards, on motion, stricken out as irrelevant and immaterial. Included in this was that of the secretary of the manufacturer, who testified that 'before July 1, 1902, we used only the Wells-Richardson improved butter color to produce an artificial coloration. Since \n\n[195 U.S. 159, 165]\n\u00a0\n that date we have used the same article. We have used some palm oil. We used that for a few days only, until the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that its use would subject the product to the 10-cent tax.'\n The verdict of a jury is conclusive upon a question of fact unless plainly against the evidence. The same weight, as we have said, must be given to the finding of a court, and upon the testimony received without objection a finding that this palm oil served substantially only to color the product cannot be disturbed. Indeed, the fact was made certain by the testimony offered by the defendant, although that testimony was afterwards stricken out by the court as immaterial.\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice Peckham dissented. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLIPPER MIN. CO. v. ELI MIN. & LAND CO.(1904)\nNo. 76\nArgued: November 13, 1903Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n On December 12, 1877, A. D. Searl and seven associates made a location of placer mining ground near the new mining camp of Leadville. The claim embraced at that time 157.02 acres of land. The original locators shortly conveyed all their interest to A. D. Searl, who applied for a patent on July 5, 1878. The application was met at the Land Office with a multitude of adverse claims. Settlements were made with some of the contestants, and on November 10, 1882, an amended application for patent was filed, including only 101 916\/1000 acres. This application was rejected by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on March 6, 1886, and his decision was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior on November 13, 1890. On November 25, 1890, four lode claims, known as the Clipper, Castle, Congress, and Capital, were located by parties other than the owners of the placer claim within the exterior boundaries of that claim. These four lode claims became, by mesne conveyances, the property of the Clipper Mining Company. It applied for a patent, and on November 23, 1893, the defendants in error, as the owners of the Searl placer location, filed an adverse claim and commenced this action in the district court of Lake county, in support of that claim. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (29 Colo. 377, 93 Am. St. Rep. 89, 68 Pac. 286,) and thereafter this writ of error was sued out.\n Messrs. W. H. Bryant, C. S. Thomas, and H. H. Lee for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John A. Ewing, A. B. Browne, Charles Cavender, and Alexander Britton for defendants in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The location of the placer mining claim and both the original and amended applications for patent thereof were long prior to the locations of the lode claims, and the contention of the plaintiffs is that they, by virtue of their location, became entitled to the exclusive possession of the surface ground; that the entry of the lode discoverers was tortious and could not create an adverse right, even though, by means of their entry and explorations they discovered the lode claims. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the original location of the placer claim was wrongful, for the reason that the ground included within it was not placer mining ground; that the intent of the locators was not placer mining, but the acquisition of title to a large tract of ground contiguous to the new mining camp of Leadville, and likely to become a part of the townsite. In fact, it was thereafter included within the limits of the town, and on it streets and alleys have been laid out and many houses built and occupied by individuals claiming adversely to the placer location.\n It is the settled rule that this court, in an action at law, at least, has no jurisdiction to review the conclusions of the highest court of a state upon questions of fact.

Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300. It must, therefore, be accepted that the Searl placer claim was duly located, that the annual labor required by law had been performed up to the time of the litigation, that there was a subsisting valid placer location, and that the lodes were discovered by their locators within the boundaries of the placer claim subsequently to its location. So the trial court specifically found, and its finding was approved by the supreme court.\n As against this, it is contended that the Land Department \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n held that the ground within the Searl location was not placer mining ground, nor subject to entry as a placer claim; that such holding by the Department must be accepted as conclusive in the courts, and therefore that the tract should be adjudged public land and open to exploration for lode claims and to location by any discoverer of such claims. It is true that the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in rejecting the amended application for the placer patent, said that he was not satisfied that the land was placer ground, or that the requisite expenditure had been made, and, further, that the locators had not acted in good faith, but were attempting to acquire title to the land on account of its value for townsite purposes and for the lodes supposed to be contained therein. This decision was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior; but notwithstanding this expression of opinion by these officials, all that was done was to reject the application for a patent. As said thereafter by the Secretary of the Interior upon an application of the Clipper Mining Company for a patent for the lode claims here in dispute:\n'The judgment of the Department in the Searl Placer Case [11 Land Dec. 441] went only to the extent of rejecting the application for patent. The Department did not assume to declare the location of the placer void, as contended by counsel, nor did the judgment affect the possessory rights of the contestant to it.' [Re Clipper Min. Co.] 22 Land Dec. 528.\n\n So far as the record shows-and the record does not purport to contain all the evidence-the placer location is still recognized in the Department as a valid location. Such also was the finding of the court; and being so there is nothing to prevent a subsequent application for a patent and further testimony to show the claimant's right to one. Undoubtedly when the Department rejected the application for a patent it could have gone further and set aside the placer location, and it can now, by direct proceedings upon notice, set it aside and restore the land to the public domain. But it has not done so, and therefore it is useless to consider what rights other parties might then have. \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n The fact that many years have elapsed since the original location of the placer claim, and that no patent has yet been issued therefor, does not affect its validity, for it is a well-known fact, as stated by the court of appeals in Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co. 61 L. R. A. 230, 50 C. C. A. 79, 112 Fed. 4, 16, that 'some of the richest mineral lands in the United States, which have been owned, occupied, and developed by individuals and corporations for many years, have never been patented.'\n The views entertained by the supreme court of the law applicable to the facts of this case are disclosed by the following quotation from its opinion. After referring to one of its previous decisions, known as the Mt. Rosa Case [26 Colo. 56, 50 L. R. A. 289, 77 Am. St. Rep. 245, 56 Pac. 176] it said:\n'If, in the case at bar, the lode claims were known to exist at the time of the entry of defendant's grantors upon the Searl placer, under the decision in the Mt. Rosa Case the entry was not unlawful; but if, on the contrary, the veins were then unknown, by the same decision the right of possession of this ground belonged to the owners of the placer location. Their right of possession included these unknown veins, and the entry for prospecting was a trespass, and no title could thereby be initiated.\n\n ... * *\n'Our conclusion, therefore, is that one may not go upon a prior valid placer location to prospect for unknown lodes, and get title to lode claims thereafter discovered and located in this manner and within the placer boundaries, unless the placer owner has abandoned his claim, waives the trespass, or by his conduct is estopped to complain of it. If the trial court intended to rule that in no circumstances may one, before application for a patent of a placer claim, go upon the ground within its exterior boundaries for the purpose of locating a lode, it went too far; yet, as general language in an opinion must be taken in connection with the facts in the particular case, the ruling here should be limited to the facts disclosed by the record, and no prejudicial error was committed. For, under the authorities, a prospector may not enter upon a prior placer location for the purpose of prospecting for, or locating, unknown \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n lodes or veins; and to uphold the judgment we must presume that the evidence before the trial court showed that the veins or lodes upon which the defendant's grantors based their locations were unknown when they entered upon the Searl placer for the purpose of prospecting.'\n\n The law under which these locations were all made is to be found in chap. 6 of Title 32, Rev. Stat. Section 2319 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1424) of that chapter reads:\n'All valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase.'\n\n Section 2320 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1424) provides for the location of mining claims upon veins or lodes.\n By  2322 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1425) it is provided that--\n'The locators of all mining locations . . . on any mineral vein, lode, or ledge, situated on the public domain, . . . shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, and of all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically.'\n\n And by  2329 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1432):\n'Claims usually called 'placers,' including all forms of deposit, excepting veins of quartz, or other rock in place, shall be subject to entry and patent, under like circumstances and conditions, and upon similar proceedings, as are provided for vein or lode claims.'\n\n Section 2333 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1433) is as follows:\n'Where the same person, association, or corporation is in possession of a placer claim, and also a vein or lode included within the boundaries thereof, application shall be made for a patent for the placer claim, with the statement that it includes such vein or lode, and in such case a patent shall issue for the placer claim, subject to the provisions of this chapter, including such vein or lode, upon the payment of five dollars per acre for \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n such vein or lode claim, and twenty-five feet of surface on each side thereof. The remainder of the placer claim, or any placer claim not embracing any vein or lode claim, shall be paid for at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents per acre, together with all costs of proceedings; and where a vein or lode, such as is described in section twenty three hundred and twenty, is known to exist within the boundaries of a placer claim, an application for a patent for such placer claim which does not include an application for the vein or lode claim shall be construed as a conclusive declaration that the claimant of the placer claim has no right of possession of the vein or lode claim; but where the existence of a vein or lode in a placer claim is not known, a patent for the placer claim shall convey all valuable mineral and other deposits within the boundaries thereof.'\n\n It will be seen that  2322 gives to the owner of a valid lode location the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of the location. That exclusive right of possession forbids any trespass. No one, without his consent, or, at least, his acquiescence, can rightfully enter upon the premises or disturb its surface by sinking shafts or otherwise. It was the judgment of Congress that, in order to secure the fullest working of the mine, and the complete development of the mineral property, the owner thereof should have the undisturbed possession of not less than a specified amount of surface. That exclusive right of possession is as much the property of the locator as the vein or lode by him discovered and located. In Belk v. Meagher, \n104 \nU.S. 279, 283\n, 26 S. L. ed. 735, 737, it was said by Chief Justice Waite that 'a mining claim perfected under the law is property in the highest sense of that term;' and in a later case (Gwillim v. Donnellan, \n115 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 29 S. L. ed. 348, 349, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1110, 1112) he adds:\n'A valid and subsisting location of mineral lands, made and kept up in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of the United States, has the effect of a grant by the United States of the right of present and exclusive possession of the lands located. If, when one enters on land to make a location, there is \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n another location in full force, which entitles its owner to the exclusive possession of the land, the first location operates as bar to the second.'\n\n In St. Louis Min. & Mill. Co. v. Montana Min. Co. \n171 \nU.S. 650, 655\n, 43 S. L. ed. 320, 322, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 61, 63, the present Chief Justice declared that 'where there is a valid location of a mining claim, the area becomes segregated from the public domain, and the property of the locator.' Nor is this 'exclusive right of possession and enjoyment' limited to the surface, nor even to the single vein whose discovery antedates and is the basis of the location. It extends (so reads the section) to 'all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically.' In other words, the entire body of ground, together with all veins and lodes whose apexes are within that body of ground becomes subject to an exclusive right of possession and enjoyment by the locator. And this exclusive right of possession and enjoyment continues during the entire life of the location, or, in the words of Chief Justice Waite, just quoted, while there is 'a valid and subsisting location of mineral lands, made and kept up in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of the United States.' There is no provision for, no suggestion of, a prior termination thereof.\n By  2329, placer claims are subject to entry and patent 'under like circumstances and conditions, and upon similar proceedings, as are provided for vein or lode claims.' The purpose of this section is apparently to place the location of placer claims on an equality both in procedure and rights with lode claims. If there were no other legislation in respect to placer claims the case before us would present little doubt; but following this are certain provisions, those having special bearing on the case before us being found in  2333. Parties obtaining a patent for a lode claim must pay 5 an acre for the surface ground, while for a placer claim the government only charges $2.50 an acre. By  2333 it is provided that one who is in possession of a placer claim and also of a lode claim \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 228]\n\u00a0\n included within the boundaries of the placer claim shall, on making application for a patent, disclose the fact of the lode claim within the boundaries of the placer, and upon the issue of the patent payment shall be made accordingly; that if the application for the placer claim does not include an application for a vein or lode claim known to exist within the boundaries of the placer, it shall be construed as a conclusive declaration that the placer claimant has no right of possession of that vein or lode; and further, that where the existence of a vein or lode within the boundaries of a placer claim is not known, the patent for the placer claim shall convey all valuable mineral and other deposits within its boundaries.\n A mineral lode or vein may have its apex within the area of a tract whose surface is valuable for placer mining, and this last section is the provision which Congress has made for such a case. That a lode or vein, descending as it often does to great depths, may contain more mineral than can be obtained from the loose deposits which are secured by placer mining within the same limits of surface area, naturally gives to the surface area a higher value in the one case than the other, and that Congress appreciated this difference is shown by the different prices charged for the surface under the two conditions. Often the existence of a lode or vein is not disclosed by the placer deposits. Hence ground may be known to be valuable and be located for placer mining, and yet no one be aware that underneath the surface there is a lode or vein of greater value. A placer location is not a location of lodes or veins underneath the surface, but is simply a claim of a tract or parcel of ground for the sake of loose deposits of mineral upon or near the surface. A lode or vein may be known to exist at the time of the placer location or not known until long after the patent therefor has been issued. There being no necessary connection between the placer and the vein, Congress by the section has provided that in an application for a placer patent the applicant shall include any vein or lode of which he has possession, and that if he does not make such inclusion the omission is to be taken \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 229]\n\u00a0\n as a conclusive declaration that he has no right of possession of such vein or lode. If, however, no vein or lode within the placer claim is known to exist at the time the patent is issued, then the patentee takes title to any which may be subsequently discovered.\n While by the statute the right of exclusive possession and enjoyment is given to a locator, whether his location be of a lode claim or a placer claim, yet the effect of a patent is different. The patent of a lode claim confirms the original location, with the right of exclusive possession, and conveys title to the tract covered by the location, together with all veins, lodes, and ledges which have their apexes therein, whereas the patent to the placer claim, while confirming the original location and conveying title to the placer ground, does not necessarily convey the title to all veins, lodes, and ledges within its area. It makes no difference whether a vein or lode within the boundaries of a lode claim is known or unknown, for the locator is entitled to the exclusive possession and enjoyment of all the veins and lodes, and the patent confirms his title to them. But a patent of a placer claim will not convey the title to a known vein or lode within its area unless that vein or lode is specifically applied and paid for.\n It is contended that because a vein or lode may have its apex within the limits of a placer claim a stranger has a right to go upon the claim, and, by sinking shafts or otherwise, explore for any such lode or vein, and on finding one obtain a title thereto. That, with the consent of the owner of the placer claim, he may enter and make such exploration, and if successful, obtain title to the vein or lode, cannot be questioned. But can he do so against the will of the placer locator? If one may do it, others may, and so the whole surface of the placer be occupied by strangers seeking to discover veins beneath the surface. Of what value then would the placer be to the locator? Placer workings are surface workings, and if the placer locator cannot maintain possession of the surface he cannot continue his workings. And if the surface is open to the entry of whoever \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 230]\n\u00a0\n seeks to explore for veins, his possession can be entirely destroyed. In this connection it may be well to notice the last sentence in  2322. That section, from which we have just quoted, is the one which gives a locator the right to pursue a vein on its dip outside the vertical side lines of his location. The sentence, which is a limitation on such right, reads: 'And nothing in this section shall authorize the locator or possessor of a vein or lode which extends in its downward course beyond the vertical lines of his claim to enter upon the surface of a claim owned or possessed by another.'\n It would seem strange that one owning a vein, and having a right in pursuing it to enter beneath the surface of another's location, should be expressly forbidden to enter upon that surface, if, at the same time, one owning no vein, and having no rights beneath the surface, is at liberty to enter upon that surface, and prospect for veins as yet undiscovered.\n We agree with the supreme court of Colorado as to the law when it says that 'one may not go upon a prior valid placer location to prospect for unknown lodes, and get title to lode claims thereafter discovered and located in this manner and within the placer boundaries, unless the placer owner has abandoned his claim, waives the trespass, or, by his conduct, is estopped to complain of it.' Perhaps if the placer owner, with knowledge of what the prospectors are doing, takes no steps to restrain their work, and certainly if he acquiesces in their action, he cannot, after they have discovered a vein or lode, assert right to it, for, generally, a vein belongs to him who has discovered it, and a locator permitting others to search within the limits of his placer ought not thereafter to appropriate that which they have discovered by such search.\n The difficulty with the case presented by the plaintiff in error is, that under the findings of fact, we must take it that the entries of the locators of these several lode claims upon the placer grounds were trespasses, and as a general rule no one can initiate a right by means of a trespass.\n Atherton v. Fowler, \n96 U.S. 513\n, 24 L. ed. 732; Trenouth v. San Francisco, \n100 U.S. 251\n, 25 L. ed. 626; Haws v. \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 231]\n\u00a0\n Victoria Copper Min.

C. A. p. 93, Fed. p. 17):\n'No right can be initiated on government land which is in the actual possession of another by a forcible, fraudulent, or clandestine entry thereon. Cowell v.

McCabe, 75 Cal. 584, 588, 17 Pac. 705; Rourke v. McNally, 98 Cal. 291, 35 Pac. 62.'\n\n If a placer locator is, as we have shown, entitled to the exclusive possession of the surface, an entry thereon against his will, for the purpose of prospecting by sinking shafts or otherwise, is undoubtedly a trespass, and such a trespass cannot be relied upon to sustain a claim of a right to veins and lodes. It will not do to say that the right thus claimed is only a right to something which belongs to the United States, and which will never belong to the placer locator, unless specifically applied and paid for by him, and therefore that he has no cause of complaint; for if the claim of the lode locator be sustained it carries, under  2320 and 2333, at least 25 feet of the surface on each side of the middle of the vein. Further, if there be no prospecting, no vein or lode discovered until after patent, then the title to all veins and lodes within the area of the placer passes to the placer patentee, and any subsequent discovery would enure to his benefit.\n Again, it is contended that the claims which the defendant sought to patent were lode claims; that the only title set up in the complaint in the adverse suit was a placer title, and that a placer claimant has no standing to maintain an adverse suit against lode applications. In support of this is cited 2 Lindley on Mines,  721, in which the author says:\n'Where an application for a patent to a lode within the \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 232]\n\u00a0\n limits of a placer is made by a lode claimant, if the placer claimant asserts any right to the lode, he is necessarily called upon to adverse. Where his claim, however, is placer, pure and simple, under which claim he cannot lawfully assert a right to the lode, he has nothing upon which to base an adverse claim, unless the lode is entirely without the placer, and the controversy is confined to a conflicting surface, or the lode claimant seeks to acquire more surface than the law permits.'\n\n We do not think the author's language is to be taken as broadly as counsel contend. Under the statutes a lode claim carries with it the right to a certain number of acres, and where one is in peaceable possession of a valid placer claim, if a stranger forcibly enters upon that claim, discovers and locates a lode claim within its boundaries, and then applies for a patent, surely the placer claimant has a right to be heard in defense of his title to the ground of which he has been thus forcibly dispossessed. If the application for a patent of the lode claim is not adversed it will pass to patent, and it may well be doubted whether the placer claimant could, after the issue of a patent under such circumstances, maintain an equitable suit to have the patentee declared the holder of the legal title to the ground for his benefit. If the placer claimant can be thus deprived of his possession and title to part of his ground, he may be in like manner dispossessed of all by virtue of many forcible trespasses and lode discoveries.\n The amount of land embraced in this placer location was about 100 acres, while the land claimed under the several lode locations was a little over 35 acres. Can it be that the placer claimant had no right to be heard in court respecting the claim of the lode claimants to so large a portion of the placer ground?\n We must not be understood to hold that, because of the judgment in this adverse suit in favor of the placer claimants, their right to a patent for the land is settled beyond the reach of inquiry by the government, or that the judgment neces- \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 233]\n\u00a0\n sarily gives to them the lodes in controversy. In 2 Lindley on Mines,  765, the author thus states the law:\n'Notwithstanding the judgment of the court on the question of the right of possession, it still remains for the Land Department to pass upon the sufficiency of the proofs, to ascertain the character of the land, and determine whether or no the conditions of the law have been complied with in good faith.'\n\n In 4 Land Dec. 316, Mr. Justice Lamar, then Secretary of the Interior, said in respect to this question:\n'Does the judgment of a court as to which of two litigants has the better title to a piece of land bind the commissioner to say, without judgment, or contrary to his judgment, that the successful litigant has complete title and is entitled to patent under the law? The usual result following a favorable judgment in a court under  2326 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1430) is , I doubt not, the issue of patent in due time; but in such case the final passing of title is not on the judgment of the court, independent of that of the Commissioner, but is on the judgment of the latter pursuant to that of the former, and on certain evidence supplemental to that furnished by the judgment roll.\n\n'The judgment of the court is, in the language of the law, 'to determine the question of the right of possession.' It does not go beyond that. When it has determined which of the parties litigant is entitled to possession, its office is ended, but title to patent is not yet established.\n\n'The party thus placed in possession may 'file a certified copy of the judgment roll with the register and receiver.' But this is not all. He may file 'the certificate of the surveyor general that the requisite amount of labor has been performed or improvements made thereon.' Why file this, or anything further, if the judgment roll settles all questions as to title and right to patent? Clearly, because the law vests in the Commissioner the authority and makes it his duty to see that the requirements of law relative to entries and granting of patents thereunder shall have been complied with before the issue of \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 234]\n\u00a0\n patent. His judgment should, therefore, be satisfied before he is called upon to take final action in any case. In this case, the judgment of the court ended the contest between the parties, and determined the right of possession. The judgment roll proves the right of possession only. The applicant must still make the proof required by law to entitle him to patent. Branagan v. Dulaney, 2 Land Dec. 744. The sufficiency of that proof is a matter for the determination of the Land Department.'\n\n This opinion was cited as an authority by this court in Perego v. Dodge, \n163 \nU.S. 160, 168\n, 41 S. L. ed. 113, 118, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 971. See also Aurora Lode v. Bulger Hill and Nugget Gulch Placer, 23 Land Dec. 95, 103. The Land Office may yet decide against the validity of the lode locations, and deny all claims of the locators thereto. So, also, it may decide against the placer location, and set it aside; and in that event all rights resting upon such location will fall with it.\n Finally, we observe that the existence of placer rights and lode rights within the same area seems to have been contemplated by Congress, and yet full provision for the harmonious enforcement of both rights is not to be found in the statutes. We do not wonder at the comment made by Lindley (1 Lindley, 2d. ed.  167) that 'the townsite laws, as they now exist, consist simply of a chronological arrangement of past legislation, an aggregation of fragments, a sort of 'crazy quilt,' in the sense that they lack harmonious blending. This may be said truthfully of the general body of the mining laws.' Many regulations of the Land Department and decisions of courts find their warrant in an effort to so adjust various statutory provisions as to carry out what was believed to be the intent of Congress and at the same time secure justice to miners and those engaged in exploring for mines. If we assume that Congress, recognizing the co- existence of lode and placer rights within the same area, meant that a lode or vein might be secured by a party other than the owner of the placer location within which it is discovered,-providing his discovery was made without forcible trespass and dispossession,-it may be \n\n[194 U.S. 220, 235]\n\u00a0\n that a court of equity is competent to provide by its decree that the discoverer of the lode, within the placer limits, shall be secured in the temporary possession of so much of the ground as will enable him to successfully work his lode, protecting, at the same time, the rights of the placer locator. But such equitable adjustment of coexisting rights cannot be secured in a simple adverse action, and it would be, therefore, beyond the limits of proper inquiry in this case to determine the rights which may exist, if, in the end, the placer location be sustained and a discovery of the lodes without forcible trespass and dispossession established.\n But for the present, for the reasons above given, we think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado was right, and it is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice White dissent. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL NAT. BANK v. WEINHARD(1904)\nNo. 109\nArgued: Decided: January 18, 1904\n\n\n\n\n These actions were brought in the circuit court of the state of Oregon for Multnomah county upon separate demands to recover the value of stock severally held by Weinhard and Williams in the Commercial National Bank of Portland, Oregon; Williams owning 60 shares of the par value of $6, 000, and Weinhard 100 shares of the par value of $10,000. By stipulation the cases were heard together in the circuit court; a jury being waived and a trial had to the court. The cases were considered together as one appeal in the supreme court of Oregon, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court (41 Or. 359, 68 Pac. 806) assessing the value of the stock, and giving \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, now defendants in error. The same facts and questions are involved in the cases, and they will be considered together. The one question arises from a motion on the part of the bank for nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiffs below had introduced no testimony, as a part of the case in chief, tending to show the value of the stock for which a recovery was sought. As appears in the record, much testimony was taken, and the Oregon supreme court regarding the stock as of some value; at least, it was held that if there was any error in overruling the motion for nonsuit, it was cured by the subsequent action in submitting testimony as to the value of the stock. In any event, this feature of the case does not present a Federal question, and upon writ of error from the judgment of a state court we are to consider in the first instance only the Federal questions involved. If those were correctly decided the judgment must be affirmed. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L. ed. 429. The plaintiffs below recovered judgment for the value of the stock upon the theory that there had been a conversion thereof, because the board of directors and the stockholders directed the assessment resulting in the sale of the stock of the plaintiffs below in satisfaction thereof.\n The Commercial National Bank of Portland was duly organized under the national banking act, and carried on business in the city of Portland, Oregon. It appeared that the capital of the bank had become impaired, and thereupon such proceedings were had that on December 5, 1896, the Comptroller issued the following notice to the bank:\n Treasury Department,\n Office of Comptroller of the Currency,\n Washington, D. C., Dec. 5, 1896\n\n\n Whereas, it appears to the satisfaction of the Comptroller of the Currency that the capital stock of the Commercial National Bank, Portland, Oregon, has become impaired to an extent which makes necessary an assessment of two hundred \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) upon the shareholders of said association to make good such deficiency:\n Now, therefore, notice is hereby given to said association, under the provisions of  5205 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3495) to pay the said deficiency in its capital stock by assessment upon its shareholders, pro rata, for the amount of the capital stock held by each, and if such deficiency shall not be paid, and said bank shall refuse to go into liquidation, as provided by law, for three months after this notice shall have been received by it, a receiver will be appointed to close up the business of the association, according to the provisions of  5234 of the Revised Statutes of the United States ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3507).\n In testimony whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name, and caused my seal of office to be affixed to these presents, at the Treasury Department, in the city of Washington, and District of Columbia, this 5th day of December, A. D. 1896.\n James H. Eckels,\n Comptroller of the Currency.\n To the Commercial National Bank, Portland, Oregon.\n After receipt of this notice, upon December 12, 1896, the board of directors passed this resolution:\n'Resolved, That in accordance with the notice served upon this association by the Comptroller of the Currency, under date of December 5, 1896, and received by this bank on the 11th day of December, 1896, an assessment is hereby levied upon the shareholders of this bank of 50 per cent or $50 per share, payable at this bank on or before March 11, 1897.\n\n'And, resolved, That the cashier of this bank be, and he hereby is, authorized and instructed to serve upon each shareholder of the bank a legal notice of the above assessment by sending such notice to each shareholder's address by registered mail.'\n\n Upon December 17, 1896, notice of this assessment was served upon each of the stockholders of the bank. The defendants in error having failed to pay this assessment, on \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n March 18, 1897, the board of directors passed a resolution directing the sale of the delinquent's stock to be made at public auction on May 5, 1897. In pursuance of this order, and on the day named, the stock was sold for the amount of the assessment. The Federal question is whether the board of directors, in thus assessing and selling the stock of the defendants in error, exceeded their powers under the national banking act; it being claimed that a valid assessment could only be made by the action of the stockholders, and that the sale by the directors upon this assessment was unlawful, and amounted to a conversion of the stock.\n Mr. E. S. Pillsbury and Messrs. Platt & Platt for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Thomas O'Day, George H. Williams, and George H. Durham for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case requires the construction of  5205 of the Revised Statutes of the United States as amended (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3495). The section is as follows:\n'Every association which shall have failed to pay up its capital stock, as required by law, and every association whose capital stock shall have become impaired by losses or otherwise, shall within three months after receiving notice thereof from the Comptroller of the Currency, pay the deficiency in the capital stock, by assessment upon the shareholders pro rata for the amount of capital stock held by each; and the Treasurer of the United States shall withhold the interest upon all bonds held by him in trust for any such association, upon notification from the Comptroller of the Currency, until otherwise notified by him. If any such association shall fail to pay up its capital stock, and shall refuse to go into liquidation, as \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n provided by law, for three months after receiving notice from the Comptroller, a receiver may be appointed to close up the business of the association, according to the provisions of section fifty-two hundred and thirty-four (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3507). [And provided, That if any shareholder of shareholders of such bank shall neglect or refuse, after three months' notice, to pay the assessment, as provided in this section, it shall be the duty of the board of directors to cause a sufficient amount of the capital stock of such shareholder or shareholders to be sold at public auction (after thirty days' notice shall be given by posting such notice of sale in the office of the bank, and by publishing such notice in a newspaper of the city or town in which the bank is located, or in a newspaper published nearest thereto) to make good the deficiency, and the balance, if any, shall be returned to such delinquent shareholder or shareholders.]'\n\n The assessment in this case was made by the board of directors without any action of the stockholders of the association, and the defendants in error having failed to pay the same upon notice, their stock was sold as directed in the statute. It is claimed that an assessment by the directors without action of the stockholders was without authority of law, and amounted to a conversion of the stock. This view was sustained in the supreme court of Oregon. The assessment ordered by the Comptroller was for the purpose of restoring the capital of the bank and thus enabling it to continue its business. Ample power is conferred upon the Comptroller for this purpose. His action is in aid of other sections of the law preventing a withdrawal of the capital, or the making of dividends when losses have been sustained equal to the undivided profits. Sections 5202- 5204, Rev. Stat (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3494, 3495). When the notice is received from the Comptroller by the bank under  5205, the association has no authority to review or gainsay the necessity thereof. That question is concluded by the action of the Comptroller. The money to be raised for the continuance of the business may or may not be used in the liquidation of debts. The assessment is entirely different from that pro- \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n vided for in  5151 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465) calling upon the individual responsibility of shareholders for the payment of debts. Under the last-named section the stockholder is required to pay such assessments as may be made, to meet the outstanding obligations of the bank, within the limit of an amount equal to the par value of the stock in addition to the amount invested therein. He has no election of payment, but is required to meet this liability, created by law for the benefit of creditors. Under  5205 the amount paid is subject to the control of the board of directors in the continued operations of the bank. If the stockholders are to have a voice in making or declining to make the assessment, they may well hesitate to intrust more capital to the control of a board under whose management it has already been impaired. Certain powers are conferred by law upon the directors.\n Section 5136 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3455) provides that the association shall have power--\n'Sixth. To prescribe, by its board of directors, by-laws not inconsistent with law, regulating the manner in which its stock shall be transferred, its directors elected or appointed, its officers appointed, its property transferred, its general business conducted, and the privileges granted to it by law exercised and enjoyed.\n\n'Seventh. To exercise, by its board of directors, or duly authorized officers or agents, subject to law, all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking; by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits; by buying and selling exchange, coin, and bullion; by loaning money on personal security; and by obtaining, issuing, and circulating notes according to the provisions of this title.'\n\n And, again, by  5145 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3463), it is declared that the 'affairs' of the corporation 'shall be managed by not less than five directors.'\n Thus the directors are given authority to transact the usual and ordinary business of national banks. Obviously, the \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n power conferred may be exercised in all usual transactions through the executive officers of the bank, without consultation with the stockholders. In the present case the question to be dealt with is vital to the continuance of the life of the association, as only by complying with the requirement of the Comptroller in assessing a sum sufficient to make up the impaired capital of the bank can its business be continued. The shareholders, by their contracts of subscription, have agreed to pay in the amount of capital stock subscribed, and to discharge the additional liability imposed by the statute. They have not contracted to meet assessments at the will of the directors to perpetuate the business of a possibly losing concern. It would be going far beyond the usual powers conferred upon directors to permit them to thus control the corporation. Corporate powers conferred upon a board of directors usually refer to the ordinary business transactions of the corporation. Chicago City R. Co. v. Allerton, 18 Wall. 233, 21 L. ed. 902. The assessment is required by the Comptroller, not by the directors. The association is to receive notice thereof, and action must be taken by the association to meet the requirements of the Comptroller under the statute. It is provided that if the association fail to pay up its capital stock, and refuse to go into liquidation, as provided by law, for three months after receiving notice from the Comptroller, a receiver may be appointed to close up the business of the association according to the provisions of  5234. This important provision is entitled to much weight in determining the proper construction of the statute. The assessment may be avoided, and the amount required is not payable, if the association decides to go into liquidation. Provision for voluntary liquidation is made in  5220 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3503), wherein authority is given to liquidate upon a vote of shareholders owning two thirds of the stock. Such liquidation does not prevent the assessment of stockholders under  5151 for the benefit of creditors, and the enforcement of the liability of the shareholders in an action by a receiver or directly by the creditors. Rev. Stat. \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n  5234 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3507);  2, act of June 30, 1876 (19 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 156), as amended, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3509. The section referred to (5234) directs the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the books, records, and assets of the association, to collect the debts and claims belonging to it, and, among other things, if necessary, to pay the debts of the association, to enforce the individual liability of the shareholders.\n We are of opinion that  5205 is intended to and does confer upon the association the privilege of declining to make the assessment to make good the deficiency to the capital, and to elect instead to wind up the business of the bank under  5220, which provides for voluntary liquidation by a vote of two thirds of the shareholders. The question is, Who shall exercise this privilege, and determine the future of the association,-is it the directors or the shareholders who have this right of decision? The origin and continuation of the association would seem to be matters in which the owners, and not the managers, of the bank are primarily interested. If these are privileges of the shareholders, and only exercisable by them, this case presents a total lack of the exertion of the power by those upon whom it is legally conferred, as no action of the shareholders was had in the present case in making the assessment. Action upon the Comptroller's order involves extraordinary action of the association, and determines its future operations or liquidation, and is not found within the powers conferred upon the directors for the management of the business of the bank. If this were not so, then the decision of a question of such vital importance is left to the directors, who may or may not be large holders of stock. As it is a matter foreign to the powers of such boards, and not conferred by statute or required for the transaction of the business of the bank, we think it was intended to be vested in the shareholders. Whether a given power is to be exercised by the directors or the shareholders depends upon its nature and the terms of the enabling act. In certain instances the law specifically requires the action of the association to be taken by its \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n incorporators or shareholders. Sections 5133, 5134, 5136, 5143, Rev. Stat. ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3454, 3455, 3463). These sections regulate matters not pertaining to the ordinary business of the bank intrusted to the directors. They deal with the exercise of those powers which concern the organization of the corporation, the amount of its capital stock, and kindred matters.\n In  5205 the requirement of the Comptroller is that the association make the assessment. It is the 'association' which is required to pay up the stock or go into liquidation. The payment of the assessments must come from the shareholders, and we are of the opinion that the statute contemplates action upon the alternatives presented in the statute by the association composed of its shareholders. It is true, as suggested by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, that it requires a two thirds vote of the stockholders to put the bank into liquidation under  5220; but if the assessment is not carried, and the shareholders have not a two thirds vote favoring liquidation, the bank is put in liquidation, and the shareholders' liability is the statutory one for the benefit of creditors, and not a venture of more capital in the enterprise, with a possible stockholders' liability upon the liquidation of the bank if it shall ultimately fail. Again, if the determination of this matter is entirely left to the directors, they may, by declining to make the assessment, force a liquidation of the bank, although the shareholders-the real owners of the property-be willing to make good the impaired capital, and continue the business. On the other hand, if the directors may assess to make good impaired capital, the shareholder must pay the assessment or submit to the sale of his stock. Such extraordinary powers are far beyond those required in the management of the bank's affairs or conferred in the sections of the law defining those conferred upon the directors. In Delano v. Butler, \n118 \nU.S. 634, 653\n, 30 S. L. ed. 260, 265, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39, 46, while the question was not directly involved, in speaking of assessments under the act, Mr. Justice Matthews, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n 'The assessment imposed upon the stockholders by their own vote, for the purpose of restoring their lost capital, as a consideration for the privilege of continuing business, and to avoid liquidation under  5205 of the Revised Statutes, is not the assessment contemplated by  5151, by which the shareholders of every national banking association may be compelled to discharge their individual responsibility for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the association. The assessment as made under  5205 is voluntary, made by the stockholders themselves, paid into the general funds of the bank as a further investment in the capital stock, and disposed of by its officers in the ordinary course of its business. It may or may not be applied by them to the payment of creditors, and, in the ordinary course of business, certainly would not be applied, as in cases of liquidation, to the payment of creditors ratably; whereas, under  5151, the individual liability does not arise, except in case of liquidation, and for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the bank. The assessment under that section is made by authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, is not voluntary, and can be applied only to the satisfaction of the creditors equally and ratably.'\n We concur in this reasoning. The assessment under  5205 provides for a sum to continue the operations of the bank, and if unpaid subjects the stock of the shareholders to sale to make good the deficiency in its collection. Shareholders are given the right to go into liquidation, subjecting themselves, it is true, to the liability of the assessment for the benefit of creditors under  5151 to an amount equal to the par value of their stock, if needed to make good the indebtedness of the bank, but risking no further investment of new capital in the continued business of the bank. The choice of methods is with the shareholders, and to them is addressed the decision of the question and the making of the assessment if that course is determined upon. Hulitt v. Bell, 85 Fed. 98. In the present case the assessment was made by the directors without action by the shareholders, and, not being \n\n[192 U.S. 243, 253]\n\u00a0\n within the statute, was void. It follows that the Supreme Court of Oregon properly affirmed the judgment of the lower court in which the value of the stock sold was recovered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORNELL v. COYNE(1904)\nNo. 118\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n On June 6, 1896, Congress passed an act (29 Stat. at L. 253, chap. 337, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2236) entitled 'An Act Defining Cheese, and Also Imposing a Tax Upon and Regulating the Manufacture, Sale, Importation and Exportation of 'Filled Cheese.\" Section 2 defines 'filled cheese.' Section 3 directs that 'manufacturers of filled cheese shall pay $ 400 for each and every factory, per annum.' Section 6 provides for the stamping and branding of the wooden packages in which manufacturers are required to pack filled cheese, and that 'all sales or consignments made by manufacturers of filled cheese to wholesale dealers in filled cheese \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 419]\n\u00a0\n or to exporters of filled cheese shall be in original stamped packages.' Sections 9 and 11 are as follows:\n'Sec. 9. That upon all filled cheese which shall be manufactured there shall be assessed and collected a tax of one cent per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and any fractional part of a pound in a package shall be taxed as a pound. The tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps; and the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this section.'\n\n'Sec. 11. That all filled cheese as herein defined imported from foreign countries shall, in addition to any import duty imposed on the same, pay an internal revenue tax of eight cents per pound, such tax to be represented by coupon stamps; and such imported filled cheese and the packages containing the same shall be stamped, marked, and branded, as in the case of filled cheese manufactured in the United States.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error were manufacturers of filled cheese, entered into contracts for its manufacture and export, and under such contracts manufactured and exported 1,580,479 pounds of filled cheese. They were required by the defendant in error, as collector, to purchase and affix stamps to the exported packages of filled cheese. They protested against such required purchase, and applied to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as authorized by  3226, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2088), for a return of the various sums so paid, but their application was rejected. Thereupon they commenced this action in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois. In the declaration they alleged 'that the requirements of the said defendant, whereby the plaintiffs were compelled in the manner aforesaid, to purchase and use the said revenue stamps, were wholly unauthorized and unwarranted by law; and that  9, of the act of Congress aforesaid, and said act itself in that the same failed to contain provisions whereby filled cheese- \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 420]\n\u00a0\n manufactured for export trade and exported and sold in foreign markets wholly without the United States might be exported and sold free from the levy of any duty or tax thereon; or provision whereby the same might be freed from the force and effect of said act, are repugnant to said  9, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and that this suit, therefore, involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.'\n A demurrer to the declaration was sustained. They elected to stand by the declaration. Judgment was entered in favor of the defendant, and thereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n Messrs. Charles W Greenfield, William E. Mason, Charles E. Kremer, and Lewis F. Mason, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 418, 424]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 418, 426]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention is that inasmuch as this filled cheese was manufactured under contract for export, and was in fact exported, the tax of 1 cent per pound prescribed by  9 was prohibited by the 5th paragraph of  9, article 1, of the Constitution, which reads: 'No tax or duty shall be laid on any articles exported from any state.'\n But this means that no burden shall be placed on exportation, and does not require that any bounty be given therefor. Congress has power to encourage exportation by remitting taxes on goods manufactured at home as it has power to encourage manufacturers by duties on imports, yet the Constitution does not compel it to do either the one or the other. This power of encouraging is illustrated by  11 of this act, which requires all imported filled cheese to pay, in addition to import duties, an internal revenue tax of 8 cents a pound,-eight times as much as that manufactured at home. To remit on articles exported the tax which is cast upon other like articles consumed at home, while perhaps not technically a bounty on exportation, has some of the elements thereof. By this act all filled cheese is subject to a manufacturing tax of 1 cent a pound. To remit that tax in favor of filled cheese exported may encourage the manufacturer to seek a foreign rather than \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 427]\n\u00a0\n a home market, but if the full tax on all filled cheese manufactured is required for the support of the government, the remission of part necessitates revenue from some other source. Doubtless the remission is given in hope of widening the market and increasing the production, but that is only a possibility of the future, while the loss in the revenue is a fact of the present. Subjecting filled cheese manufactured for the purpose of export to the same tax as all other filled cheese is casting no tax or duty on articles exported, but is only a tax or duty on the manufacturing of articles in order to prepare them for export While that which is asked in this case is the return of a manufacturing tax, there is nothing in the constitutional provision to distinguish between manufacturing and other taxes, and if the plaintiff's contention be sustained as to a manufacturing tax it would follow that the government was bound to refund all prior taxes imposed on articles exported. A farmer may raise cattle with the purpose of exportation, and in fact export them. Can it be that he is entitled to a return of all property taxes which have been cast upon those cattle? The true construction of the constitutional provision is that no burden by way of tax or duty can be cast upon the exportation of articles, and does not mean that articles exported are relieved from the prior ordinary burdens of taxation which rest upon all property similarly situated. The exemption attaches to the export, and not to the article before its exportation. Such has been the ruling of this court. In Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 \nU.S. 504, 506\n, 29 S. L. ed. 988, 989, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 835, 836, where the question was as to an export stamp tax on tobacco, Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, said:\n'The constitutional prohibition against taxing exports is substantially the same when directed to the United States as when directed to a state. In the one case the words are, 'No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' Art. 1,  9, par. 5. In the other they are, No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports.' Art. 1,  10, par. 2. The prohibition \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 428]\n\u00a0\n in both cases has reference to the imposition of duties on goods by reason or because of their exportation or intended exportation, or whilst they are being exported. That would be laying a tax or duty on exports, or on artieles exported, within the meaning of the Constitution. But a general tax, laid on all property alike, and not levied on goods in course of exportation, nor because of their intended exportation, is not within the constitutional prohibition.'\n\n See also Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 29 L. ed. 257, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1091; Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475.\n Justice Miller, in his lectures on the Constitution (p. 592), says:\n'The Congress of the United States, during the late Civil war, imposed a tax upon cotton and tobacco, which tax was not limited to those products when in the process of transportation, but was assessed on all the cotton and tobacco in the country. It was argued that because the larger part of these products was exported out of the country and sold to foreign nations, and because their production was limited to a particular part of the country, the tax was forbidden by the corresponding clause of the Constitution prohibiting Congress from levying a tax on exports. Although the question came at that time to the Supreme Court of the United States, it was not then decided, because of a division of opinion in that court. The recent cases, however, of Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, and Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 U.S. 504\n, 29 L. ed. 988, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 835, seem to decide that the objection was not valid, and hold that only such property as is in the actual process of exportation, and which has begun its voyage or its preparation for the voyage, can be said to be an export.'\n\n Some light is thrown on this question by the cases of Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 U.S. 1\n, 32 L. ed. 346, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6, and United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. In the former a manufacturer of intoxicating liquors in Iowa claimed to be beyond the reach of the prohibitory law of the state on the ground that he manufactured only for shipment to other states, and therefore, as Congress had \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 429]\n\u00a0\n exclusive control over interstate commerce, it had like control over the manufacture for interstate commerce. But this court, in an elaborate opinion by Mr. Justice Lamar, unanimously held against the contention, and decided that commerce did not commence until manufacture was finished, and that therefore the state was not prevented from exercising exclusive control over the manufacture. In the latter ease the question was whether a monopoly of the business of manufacturing sugar within a state was a restraint of interstate commerce, and therefore within the purview of the act of Congress to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies (26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200) and it was held that it did not, Chief Justice Fuller announcing the opinion of the court, saying (pp. 12 and 13, L. ed. p. 329, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 253):\n'Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it. . . . The fact that an article is manufactured for export to another state does not of itself make it an article of interstate commerce, and the intent of the manufacturer does not determine the time when the article or product passes from the control of the state and belongs to commerce.'\n\n There is nothing in the case of Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 45 L. ed. 862, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, inconsistent with these views. There the question was as to the validity of a stamp tax on a foreign bill of lading, and it was held that it was a tax directly on the exportation. As said in the opinion with reference to the constitutional provision (p. 292, L. ed. p. 866, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 652): 'The purpose of the restriction is that exportation, all exportation, shall be free from national burden.' It is unnecessary to refer to the earlier legislation for the government in his brief, has been for the government in his brief, bas been in harmony with this construction. From what we have said it is clear that there is no constitutional objection to the imposition of the same manufacturing tax on filled cheese manufactured for export and, in fact, exported, as upon other filled cheese.\n Although the only charge in the declaration and the only matter complained of in the assignments of error is the uncon- \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 430]\n\u00a0\n stitutionality of the act, and especially of  9 thereof, in failing to contain provisions for the exportation of filled cheese free from the levy of any tax or duty, counsel have in this court made a further contention that if the act be constitutional, it is because, properly construed, it does provide for exportation free from tax or duty. The argument is that the title of the act names as one of its purposes to regulate 'exportation;' that while in the act there is no express provision for exportation,  9, in reciting that 'the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this section,' is to be construed as incorporating all provisions respecting stamps 'relating to tobacco and snuff,' including those for stamps on exports, which are issued free of charge.\n Assuming, without deciding, that we may rightfully reverse the judgment of the circuit court for a failure to consider a question which was not presented, and that we may treat the declaration as amended so as to present this question, we are of opinion that the contention as to the construction of the act cannot be sustained. The title of an act is referred to only in cases of doubt or ambiguity.\n'The title is no part of an act, and cannot enlarge or confer powers, or control the words of the act unless they are doubtful or ambiguous. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 386, 2 L. ed. 304, 313; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, \n132 \nU.S. 174, 188\n, 33 S. L. ed. 302, 307, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68. The ambiguity must be in the context, and not in the title, to render the latter of any avail.' United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n164 \nU.S. 526, 541\n, 41 S. L. ed. 541, 545, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165, 170. See also Price v. Forrest, \n173 \nU.S. 410, 427\n, 43 S. L. ed. 749, 755, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434, and cases cited.\n\n There is no doubt or ambiguity in the act. Section 9 explicitly declares 'that upon all filled cheese which shall be manufactured there shall be assessed and collected a tax of one cent per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof.' And while the section contains a reference to existing laws \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 431]\n\u00a0\n governing the engraving, issue, etc., of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, that clause is a part of the sentence which provides that the tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps, and the existing laws governing the engraving, issue, etc., of stamps are in terms 'hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this section' as far as applicable. In other words, the provisions of existing laws concerning the engraving, issue, etc., of stamps are made applicable only to stamps representing taxes. There is neither directly nor indirectly any reference to stamps issued without cost to cover an exportation free from tax or duty. While in  3 there is special reference by number to various sections of the Revised Statutes concerning special taxes, and they are made to extend so far as applicable to the taxes authorized by this act, there is nowhere any mention of  3385, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2212), which provides for relieving exported manufactured tobacco and snuff from the manufacturing tax. Further, in  6 it is directed that all sales to exporters of filled cheese shall be in original stamped packages, and this direction is in the same sentence with that providing for sales to wholesale dealers. Clearly there is nothing in the body of the act exempting exported filled cheese from the ordinary manufacturing tax on other filled cheese. But if there were a doubt as to the meaning of the statute that doubt should be resolved in favor of the government. Whoever claims a privilege from the government should point to a statute which clearly indicates the purpose to grant the privilege.\n'But if there be any doubt as to the proper construction of this statute (and we think there is none), then that construction must be adopted which is most advantageous to the interests of the government. The statute being a grant of a privilege, must be construed most strongly in favor of the grantor. Gildart v. Gladstone, 12 East, 668, 675; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544, 9 L. ed. 773, 822; Dubuque & P. R. Co. v. Litchfield, 23 How. 66, 16 L. ed. 500; Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 75, 18 L. ed. 137, 143; Rice v. Minnesota & N. W. R.

Rep. 874.\n\n Why Congress should grant an exemption from manufacturing tax in the case of exported tobacco and not in the case of exported filled cheese is not for us to determine. Doubtless the reasons which prompted such difference were satisfactory. It is enough that no exemption has been made in favor of the latter.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court was right, and it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brown did not hear the argument, and took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n As this case went off upon demurrer by the government to the declaration, its material allegations must be taken as true. The case cannot properly be dealt with upon any other basis.\n The declaration shows that the plaintiffs in error, who were plaintiffs below, were engaged in the business of manufacturing what is known in commercial circles as filled cheese; and that in execution of certain contracts made with foreign eustomers the plaintiffs manufactured large quantities of filled cheese, and shipped it by instalments, directly from their factory in Illinois, to Liverpool and London. It alleged that 'each quantity or instalment of filled cheese manufactured, exported, and delivered by the plaintiffs under said contracts was forwarded by the plaintiffs as soon as the same was ready for shipment from their factory in said district, and prior to the shipment thereof the plaintiffs applied to the defendant as such collector for permission to ship and forward the same without purchasing, and attaching to said filled cheese or to the said packages containing the said filled cheese the revenue stamps required by an alleged \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 433]\n\u00a0\n act of Congress, approved June 6th, A. L. 1896, with reference to internal revenues; but notwithstanding the fact that such filled cheese was manufactured for export, and was about to be delivered by the plaintiffs for export and shipment to a foreign market, . . . the defendant did at various times during said period, and on the dates of shipment of said filled cheese, by force, duress, exact,' etc.\n Upon the occasion of each of the shipments the internal revenue collector exacted and collected (against the protest of the plaintiffs) a tax upon the cheese of 1 cent per pound, the collector insisting that such a tax was imposed by the act of Congress of June 6th, 1896, entitled 'An Act Defining Cheese, and Also Imposing a Tax Upon and Regulating the Manufacture, Sale, Importation and Exportation of Filled Cheese.' 29 Stat. 253, chap. 337, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2236\n\n\n The first question to be considered is whether Congress intended by that act to impose a tax of 1 cent per pound upon filled cheese manufactured for exportation, and which, it is admitted, was in fact exported immediately after being so manufactured. Such is the case before the court for consideration.\n The 9th section of the act of 1896, under which the collection proceeded, provides that 'upon all filled cheese which shall be manufactured there shall be assessed and collected a tax of one cent per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and any fractional part of a pound in a package shall be taxed as a pound. The tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps; and the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this section.'  9.\n Observe that the section refers to 'existing laws' relating, among other things, to the issue and sale of stamps for tobacco and snuff. That reference, I submit, embraced  3385 of the Revised Statutes, Title, Internal Revenue (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2212) which provides: \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 434]\n\u00a0\n 'Manufactured tobacco, snuff, and cigars intended for immediate exportation may, after being properly inspected and branded, be removed from the manufactory in bond without having affixed thereto the stamps indicating the payment of the tax thereon. The removal of such tobacco, snuff, and cigars from the manufactory shall be made under such regulations, and after making such entries, and executing and filing with the collector of the district from which the removal is to be made such bonds and bills of lading, and giving such other additional security, as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. There shall be affixed to each package of tobacco, snuff, and cigars intended for immediate export, before it is removed from the manufactory, an engraved stamp indicative of such intention. Such stamp shall be provided and furnished to the several collectors as in the case of other stamps, and they shall account for the use of the same. When the manufacturer has made the proper entries, filed the bonds, and otherwise complied with the requirements of law and regulations as herein provided, the collector shall issue to him a permit for the removal, accurately describing the tobacco, snuff, and cigars to be shipped, the number and kind of packages, the number of pounds, the amount of tax, the marks and brands, the state and collection district from which the same are shipped, the number of the manufactory and the manufacturer's name, the port from which the said tobacco, snuff, and cigars are to be exported, the route or routes over which the same are to be sent to the port of shipment, and the name of the vessel or line by which they are to be conveyed to the foreign port. The bonds required to be given for the exportation of the tobacco, snuff, and cigars shall be canceled upon the presentation of the proper certificates that said tobacco, snuff, and cigars have been landed at any port without \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 435]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of the United States, or upon satisfactory proof that after shipment the same were lost at sea.'\n It requires no argument to prove that, under that section, manufactured tobacco and snuff 'intended for immediate exportation' could be exported without payment of any tax and without having affixed thereto any stamp other than 'an engraved stamp indicative of such intention.' The effect of the reference in the last clause of the 9th section of the act of 1896, to 'existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff' was, I think, to incorporate into that act  3385 of the Revised Statutes, so far as it could be made applicable to filled cheese, and to allow filled cheese intended for immediate exportation to be removed from the manufactory without payment of any tax, having affixed to it no other stamp than one engraved and indicating the intention to export. In that view, which seems to me incontestable, the purpose of Congress was to put manufactured filled cheese intended for immediate exportation upon the same footing as manufactured tobacco and snuff intended for immediate exportation, and to permit its exportation without payment of any tax. Certainly  3385 was one of the existing laws at the date of the passage of the act of 1896, and if applied to that act the result, I submit, must be as just stated. This question is within such narrow compass that it cannot be elucidated by extended discussion; and if the bare reading of the above statutes, all together, does not bring the mind to the conclusion indicated by me, argument to that end would be unavailing.\n So I leave that question and come to the proposition that if the act of 1896 is to be construed as imposing a tax upon the plaintiff's cheese, when about to be exported, then it is in conflict with the Constitution.\n The 8th section of article 2 of the Constitution enumerates certain powers which Congress may exercise, while the 9th section specifies certain things that Congress may not \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 436]\n\u00a0\n do. The express words of that instrument are that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' Manifestly, so far as any prohibitory action by Congress is concerned, the object of that provision was to open the markets of the world to the products and manufactures of the several states, freed from any tax or burden whatever imposed by the United States. This court said in Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 292\n, 45 S. L. ed. 862, 866, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, 652, that the 'purpose of the restriction [on the power of Congress] is that exportation, all exportation, shall be free from national burden.'\n I do not contend that the owner of an article about to be exported could rightfully ship it to a foreign country without paying such tax as had legally attached in favor of the government prior to the date on which the owner formed the purpose to export. An existing property tax upon a manufactured article which had become a part of the general mass of property and was held in the possession of the owner for purposes of sale or use in this country, could not be defeated by reason of the fact that the owner-subsequent to manufacture, and after a substantial interval of time-formed the intention to export it. But that is not this case, although the court seems to treat it as if it were one of that kind. The government admitted by its demurrer to the declaration that the filled cheese in question was manufactured for exportation: that upon the completion of the manufacture the plaintiff, as soon as it was ready for shipment from their factory, set about to export it; and that it was ready to be delivered for such exportation when the collector took the position that before it could be removed from his district and exported, the tax of 1 cent per pound, imposed by the 9th section of the act of 1896 'upon all filled cheese which shall be manufactured,' must be paid. It is, in effect, admitted of record that the plaintiffs never had any other purpose than to export the cheese, as soon as manufactured, in fulfillment of contracts previously made with foreign customers, and that they promptly prepared it for exportation. There was no appreciable interval of time between \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 437]\n\u00a0\n the commencement of manufacture and the preparation for exportation, when it could be reasonably said that the cheese had become a part of the general mass of property in the locality of its manufacture for purposes of sale, delivery, or consumption in this country. So that the question arises whether it is consistent with the constitutional injunction, 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state,' that at the instant when an article admittedly manufactured for exportation is being prepared in good faith for exportation, not for sale or consumption here a national tax be laid on such article as property. If that question be answered in the affirmative, then the purpose of the constitutional restriction that 'all exportation shall be free from national burden,' may be defeated; for if, in such circumstances as are disclosed in this case, Congress can impose a tax of 1 cent per pound on filled cheese, manufactured and intended for immediate exportation, and about to be exported, it can impose such taxes on articles manufactured in this country and intended for immediate exportation as will make it impossible for manufacturers to secure, or will deter them from attempting to secure, contracts with foreign consumers or buyers. The result would be that Congress, in time of peace and by means of taxation, could bring about a condition of utter occlusion between the manufacturers of this country and the markets of other countries. Indeed, the several states could bring about that result by taxation; for if an article manufactured for exportation and which was prepared for exportation as soon as manufacture was completed, is not an export from the moment such preparation was begun, then a state may impose a tax upon it as property and compel the payment thereof before the article is removed from its limits for exportation. I do not think that the framers of the Constitution contemplated such a condition as possible.\n In support of the views expressed in it the opinion reproduces the following observations by Mr. Justice Miller in one of his lectures on Constitutional Law (p. 592): 'The Congress \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 438]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, during the late Civil War, imposed a tax upon cotton and tobacco, which tax was not limited to those products when in the process of transportation, but was assessed on all the cotton and tobacco in the country. It was urged that because the larger part of these products was exported out of the country and sold to foreign nations, and because their production was limited to a particular part of the country, the tax was forbidden by the corresponding clause of the Constitution prohibiting Congress from levying a tax on exports. Although the question came at that time to the Supreme Court of the United States, it was not then decided, because of a division of opinion in that court. The recent cases, however, of Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, and Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 U.S. 504\n, 29 L. ed. 988, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 835, seem to decide that the objection was not valid, and hold that only such property as is in the actual process of exportation, and which has begun its voyage or its preparation for the voyage, can be said to be an export.'\n I submit that these observations do not justify the conclusion announced by the court; for, the eminent jurist who made them says that property is to be deemed an export from the time it is in the actual process of exportation and 'its preparation for the voyage' has begun. That is, in substance, the precise principle for which I am contending. Whilst the cheese was in the process of being manufactured, it was not, of course, a subject of taxation under the statute. It became manufactured filled cheese only when manufacture was completed. But, as soon as it was manufactured and prepared for shipment, and when it was about to be started on its journey to Europe, the collector exacted from the plaintiffs the property tax imposed by the act of 1896. In my judgment, within the meaning of the Constitution, and in every just sense, the cheese was in the actual process of exportation, and became an export from the moment when, immediately after the completion of manufacture, without loss of time, the plaintiffs, in good faith, prepared it for shipment in fulfilment of their contracts with foreign customers. In the Fairbank Case the court held that \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 439]\n\u00a0\n a mere stamp tax on a bill of lading taken at the time articles were shipped from a state to a foreign country was a tax on the articles themselves as exports, and was forbidden by the constitutional provision that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state. It is now held that a tax on articles admittedly manufactured only for exportation, and not for sale or consumption in this country, and which are exported as soon as they can be made ready for shipment, after the completion of manufacture, in execution of contracts entered into prior to the commencement of manufacture, is a tax on the articles themselves as property, and not on them as exports. In short, the effect of the present decision is to say that, if Congress so wills, articles manufactured in this country, although manufactured only for exportation, and not for sale or consumption here, cannot be exported to other countries, except subject to such tax as Congress may choose to impose on the manufactured articles as property. Thus, despite the express prohibition of all taxes or duties upon articles exported from the states, Congress is recognized as having the same power over exports from the several states as it has exercised over imports from foreign countries. I do not think it has such power.\n The views I have expressed are not in conflict with the judgment in Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 U.S. 504\n, 29 L. ed. 988, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 835, cited in the opinion of the court. That was not a case of a property tax upon a manufactured article intended for exportation, but a mere stamp tax imposed by the internal revenue law upon manufactured tobacco, and placed upon the tobacco in order to indicate the purpose to export it. The only issue was as to the validity of the statute imposing that stamp tax. There was nothing to show any purpose to export the goods immediately upon the completion of manufacture. The goods remained in the factory, and the court said that they 'might never be exported,' and 'whether they would be or not would depend altogether on the will of the manufacturer.' There was no showing of preparation for exportation as soon as such \n\n[192 U.S. 418, 440]\n\u00a0\n preparation could begin after manufacture. In the present case, as we have seen, it is admitted that the filled cheese was manufactured for exportation and was being prepared, immediately after manufacture, for exportation. The tax here was, in effect, collected while the cheese was being made ready for exportation, and therefore, to use the words of Turpin v. Burgess, whilst it 'was being exported.'\n For the reasons stated, I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRAMER v. WILSON(1904)\nNo. 47\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a bill originally filed February 1, 1888, in the superior court of Cook county by the plaintiff in error, Cramer, \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 409]\n\u00a0\n under her then name of Fannie N. Dresser, against her sister, Lilly B. Dresser, Henry H. Gage, Julia Wilson, and two others for the partition of certain real estate in Chicago, for a settlement of equities or liens thereon, for a receiver, and for the removal of certain clouds upon complainant's title.\n The material facts of the case are as follows: Shortly before the beginning of this suit Fannie N. Dresser was the record owner of the property in question through a patent from the United States. On January 31, 1888, the day before this suit was commenced, Fannie N. Dresser conveyed to her sister, Lilly B. Dresser, an undivided one third of the property in question. The court found this deed to have been collusive, and executed by an arrangement with the defendant Gage, who held certain tax deeds to the premises, found to be invalid, and for the purpose of filing this bill for partition, and the removal of a cloud upon the title caused by another tax deed, acquired by Frederick R. Wilson in 1864. His interest in the property was conveyed by him to his sister, Julia Wilson, in 1877. Julia Wilson was made defendant to the bill as the owner of this tax title.\n It appeared, however, that Julia Wilson died on December 15, 1887, leaving Frederick R. Wilson her sole legatee and executor. The suit was then abated as to Julia Wilson, and Frederick R. Wilson was substituted as defendant in her place. The deed to this property from Frederick R. Wilson to his sister was a conditional conveyance, but by agreement of the parties it was subsequently treated by them as absolute; and upon the death of Julia Wilson, in December, 1887, the property again became vested in Frederick R. Wilson as her only heir at law and next of kin, and as her sole devisee under her last will and testament. Shortly after the deed to Julia, Frederick R. Wilson went into bankruptcy (August 30, 1978), and Robert E. Jenkins was appointed his assignee. The property was subsequently ordered to be sold, and in 1889 was purchased from the assignee by one Taylor E. Snow for the sum of $250. Both Jenkins, the assignee, and Snow, the purchaser, were \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n made parties defendant to the bill, and subsequently filed answers and a cross bill.\n It appeared that Gage, after the beginning of the suit, bought the interest of Lilly B. Dresser, and also that the purchase by Snow at the bankruptcy sale was made in his interest; so that the real parties to this litigation are Gage upon one side and Wilson upon the other.\n Upon the first hearing, the court entered a decree of partition denying Wilson's claim of title, and holding that his interest passed to Snow by the assignee's sale. This decree was reversed by the supreme court of Illinois upon the ground that the plaintiff had not proved her title from the government to the property. Leave was given the parties to amend, and subsequently an amended bill was filed and answered. Upon the second hearing, the court held that the premises were the property of Frederick R. Wilson, and had been his from 1864 until 1877, when he conveyed them to his sister; that at the time of bankruptcy proceedings, in 1878, the title was in Julia Wilson, and that upon the death of Julia Wilson, in 1887, the title again vested in Frederick R. Wilson; that at the time Frederick R. Wilson was adjudged a bankrupt Julia Wilson was alive and vested with the title to this property, and that the defendant Snow acquired no title when he purchased all of the estate, real and personal, of the bankrupt, Frederick R. Wilson.\n This decree was affirmed by the Illinois supreme court (202 Ill. 83, 66 N. E. 869), and it is to reverse that decree that plaintiffs have taken a writ of error from this court.\n Messrs. Frederick W. Becker, Robert A. Childs, and Charles Hudson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 408, 413]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David K. Tone and George Gillette for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown: \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n Upon the first hearing, the superior court entered a decree of partition, finding that the Dresser sisters were the owners of the property at the beginning of the suit, through a title derived from the government; that after the suit began Lilly B. Dresser conveyed her interest to Henry H. Gage; that Julia Wilson, to whom her brother, Frederick R. Wilson, had conveyed his interest in the property, died testate, leaving her interest in the property to Frederick R. Wilson, and that this interest subsequently passed to Snow by purchase from the assignee, Jenkins.\n This decree was reversed by the supreme court (152 Ill. 387, 38 N. E. 888), which held that there was no evidence of a title in fee in complainants, derived from the government; that, although Frederick R. Wilson showed a deed to himself from the city of Chicago, dated May 24, 1864, and possession under such deed, he conveyed his interest to his sister, Julia Wilson, in 1877; that about a year thereafter he went into bankruptcy, and that at the assignee's sale nothing passed to the purchaser, Snow, but the interest of the bankrupt on August 30, 1878. 'But,' said the court, 'the evidence shows that at that time he had no interest, having, more than a year prior to that date, July 6, 1877, conveyed it to Julia Wilson; and the evidence is undisputed as to the fact that she took pos- \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 415]\n\u00a0\n session under that deed, and retained it by her tenants to the date of her death, and that her tenants remained in such possession when this suit was begun.' The court found that there was nothing to show that Julia Wilson had not died seised of the property, and that it was not until her death, in 1887, that defendant became repossessed of it. The case was reversed, and remanded with leave to amend the pleadings and put in additional testimony.\n Upon a rehearing in the superior court, a decree was entered in favor of the defendant, Wilson, establishing his title to the premises, subject to the repayment of certain taxes paid by Gage. Upon the second appeal to the supreme court that court held that, it having been shown that defendant and his sister had been in possession of the property for more than twenty years prior to the bringing of that suit, defendant had a good title by limitation, unless it was cut off and defeated by the assignee's sale to Snow; but that, as he had sold to his sister, Julia Wilson, in July, 1877, thirteen months before the bankruptcy, and she had taken possession, he had no title, and none passed to Snow by purchase from the assignee.\n Complainants, however, took the position that the deed from Wilson to his sister was not absolute, but was made to secure a debt, and was constructively a mortgage, and that an equity of redemption remained in Frederick R. Wilson, which would pass to Snow as purchaser at the time of the assignee's sale. But the court held that, under the arrangement between the parties, the deed became absolute long before the defendant was adjudged a bankrupt. That, under the law of Illinois, when land has been conveyed by deed, absolute in form, though intended as security for the payment of a debt, the payment of the debt may be abandoned, and the deed treated as an absolute conveyance, although originally intended as a mortgage, and that such arrangement may be made by parol, and be binding. 202 Ill. 83, 66 N. E. 869.\n It thus appears that the case turned upon the validity of the deed from the appellee to his sister, Julia Wilson. It was \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 416]\n\u00a0\n insisted that the deed was either fraudulent and void as against creditors, or that a residuary interest remained in Frederick R. Wilson, which would pass under the assignee's sale. This was a local, and not a Federal, question. The deed, having been made a year before the proceedings in bankruptcy were begun, and eleven years before the commencement of this suit, was not attacked as invalid under the bankrupt law of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176], then in force, but as a fraudulent conveyance under the state law. The question of fraud was ignored by the state court, although it was directly involved in the issue, and, hence, must be treated as overruled. It was admitted that, if the property were that of Julia Wilson at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, nothing passed under the assignee's sale; and it was only upon the theory that it was the property of the bankrupt that the assignee could convey anything to the purchaser. To reverse the state court upon this point would be to hold that it improperly construed its own laws with reference to fraudulent conveyances. The assignee's sale as a conveyance of the property of the bankrupt was not attacked in any way. He was a mere conduit through which the interest of Frederick R. Wilson, if he had any for himself or his creditors, passed to Snow. We have repeatedly held that, when the question in a state court is not whether, if the bankrupt had title, it would pass to his assignee, but whether he had title at all, and the state court decided that he had not, no Federal question is presented. Scott v. Kelly, 22 Wall. 57, 22 L. ed. 729; McKenna v. Simpson, \n129 U.S. 506\n, 32 L. ed. 771, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365. The same principle was applied to a different class of cases in Blackburn v. Portland Gold Min. Co. \n175 U.S. 571\n, 44 L. ed. 276, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; De Lamar's Nevada Gold Min. Co. v. Nesbitt, \n177 U.S. 523\n, 44 L. ed. 872, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715. In Williams v. Heard, \n140 U.S. 529\n, 35 L. ed. 550, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 885, relied upon by the plaintiff in error, the property in dispute belonged admittedly to the bankrupts, and the question was whether it was of such a character as to pass to their assignee. Of course, this involved a construction of the bankrupt act.\n If there be any Federal question, it arises from the denial of the petition of the appellee, filed in the bankruptcy court \n\n[195 U.S. 408, 417]\n\u00a0\n September 17, 1889, about two months after the sale was confirmed, to set aside and vacate such sale for inadequacy of price and want of notice that the sale would take place. It is insisted that this denial was res judicata of Wilson's interest in the property, and that the refusal of the court to so treat it denied to the order of the bankruptcy court the full faith and credit to which it was entitled. But, on referring to the order of sale of June 27, 1889, we find that the assignee was directed to sell simply 'the interest of such bankrupt and of said assignee,' without attempting to adjudicate what that interest was, or whether he had any interest at all. It was left for other courts in other proceedings to determine what his interest, or that of his creditors, was on August 30, 1878, the day on which he was adjudged a bankrupt. That interest would, of course, pass to the assignee. We have already seen that the supreme court found he had none upon that day. The district court authorized the sale of such as he had, but made no attempt to determine or guarantee that he had an interest that would pass by the sale. The refusal to set aside the sale was largely a matter of discretion, and may have been justified by the consideration that the bankrupt was not injured by the fact that it had taken place. There was certainly no attempt to adjudicate the amount of his interest.\n The circumstance that, nine years after his adjudication in bankruptcy, he took title to the property as the devisee of his sister, does not lend any significance to the fact that, at the date of his bankruptcy, his sister was the owner, in possession by tenants, and that the supreme court found her title to be absolute.\n The decree of that court is, therefore, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRAWFORD v. BURKE(1904)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 176, 177]\n\u00a0\n This was an action in trover instituted September 10, 1897, in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, by Burke against Crawford & Valentine, plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for the wilful and fraudulent conversion of certain reversionary interests of the plaintiff in 550 shares of Metropolitan Traction stock.\n There were ten counts in the declaration. In each of the first five counts it was alleged that the defendant firm of Crawford & Valentine were stock brokers and dealers in investment securities; that plaintiff employed the defendants as his brokers and agents to buy, hold, and carry stocks for him, subject to his order; that defenants had in their possession, or under their control, certain shares of the capital stock of the Metropolitan Traction Company, which they were holding as a pledge and security for the amount due them from the plaintiff on said stock; that defendants wrongfully, wilfully, and fraudulently, and without his knowledge or consent, sold said shares of stock, and wilfully and fraudulently, and with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff, converted plaintiff's reversionary interest in said stock to their use, whereby it was wholly lost.\n In each of the last five counts it was alleged that after defendants had wrongfully and fraudulently, and without plain- \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 178]\n\u00a0\n tiff's knowledge or consent, sold the plaintiff's stock, and converted the proceeds of such sales to their own use, they falsely and fraudulently represented to him that they still had the stock on hand and were carrying it for him; that their correspondents in Philadelphia, where the stock had been bought, were calling upon them for further demands or margins, and that it therefore became necessary to call upon the plaintiff to make further payments on the stock in order to comply with their correspondents' demands and to be secured against loss. It was averred in each of said counts that such representations were false and fraudulent, and by means thereof defendants obtained from the plaintiff the aggregate sum of $10,800.\n To this declaration defendants pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined January 4, 1900, and on May 12, 1900, a jury trial was waived in writing. The case rested without action until January 3, 1901, when defendants filed their separate pleas of puis darrein continuance, setting up that on April 5, 1900, the defendants had received their discharge in bankruptcy, in the district court for the northern district of Illinois, and that plaintiff's claims were provable and not excepted from the operation of such discharge. The plaintiff replied, denying that his claim was provable, and averred that the same was excepted from such operation.\n Notwithstanding the plea of puis darrein continuance, the plaintiff introduced evidence and proved the allegations in his declaration, and the amount of damages he had sustained. Defendants were found guilty upon all the counts, and judgment entered against them.\n The case was taken to the appellate court, where, it appearing that one of the justices had taken part in the trial of the case below, and that the two remaining justices were unable to agree upon the case, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed. The judgment of the appellate court was also affirmed by the supreme court of Illinois (201 Ill. 581, 66 N. E. 833), to review which judgment this writ of error was sued out. \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Packard, Charles E. Vroman, and Harrison Musgrave for plaintiffs error.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John E. Burke in propria persona for defendant in error.\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n A year after this case was put at issue, and upon the opening of the trial, defendants filed their separate pleas puis darrein continuance, setting up their discharge in bankruptcy, and averring that plaintiff's claim was a provable debt, and the discharge a complete defense.\n It is a well-settled principle of law, and was so held by the supreme court of Illinois in this case, that a plea puis darrein continuance waives all prior pleas, and amounts to an admission of the cause of the action set up in the plaintiff's declaration. Mount v. Scholes, 120 Ill. 394, 11 N. E. 401; East St. Louis v. Renshaw, 153 Ill. 491, 38 N. E. 1048; Angus v. Chicago Trust & Sav. Bank, 170 Ill. 298, 48 N. E. 946; Kimball v. Huntington, 10 Wend. 675, 25 Am. Dec. 590.\n But notwithstanding this, plaintiff was permitted to introduce evidence in proof of the fraud alleged in his declaration; and upon the conclusion of the trial the court found there had been a conversion of plaintiff's reversionary interest in the stock, for which he \"had a right to recover in trover,\" and that it was not such a debt as was barred by the bankruptcy act. Upon appeal to the supreme court it was held that it was not necessary to the judgment to decide whether the allegations of the declaration were admitted by the pleadings, as they were established by the proof which had been adduced \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n by plaintiff, \"and, the propositions held as law on that branch of the case being correct, judgment for plaintiff necessarily follows.\" That court also held that the case, being on of fraud, was not covered by the defendants' discharge in bankruptcy.\n The only Federal question involved in the case is whether the supreme court of Illinois gave the proper effect to the discharge pleaded by the defendants. If plaintiff's claim was not a provable debt, or was expressly excepted from the operation of the discharge the decision of that court was right; but if it was covered by the discharge, such discharge was a complete defense.\n Section 17 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 contains, among other things, the following provisions:\n\"Sec. 17. A discharge in bankruptcy shall release the bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another, . . . or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity.\" [30 Stat. at L. 550, chap. 541, U. S. Comp Stat. 1901, p. 3428.]\n\n Under this section, whether the discharge of the defendants in bankruptcy shall operate as a discharge of plaintiff's debt, it not having been reduced to judgment, depends upon the fact whether that debt was 'provable' under the bankruptcy act,-that is, susceptible of being proved; second whether it was or was not created by defendant's fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.\n\n 1. \nProvable debts are defined by  63, a copy of which appears in the margin. Paragraph a of this section includes \n Sec. 63. Debts which may be proved.-(a) Debts of thee bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that date, or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest; (2) due as costs taxable against an involuntary bankrupt who was, at the time of the filing of the petition against him, plaintiff in a cause of action which would pass to the trustee, and which the trustee declines to prosecute after notice; (3) founded upon a claim for taxable costs incurred in good faith by a creditor before the filling of the petition in an action to recover a proable debt; (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract, express or implied; and (5) founded upon provable debts reduced to judgments after the filing of the petition, and before the consideration of the bankrupt's application for a discharge, less costs incurred and interests \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 187]\n\u00a0\n debts arising upon contracts, express or implied, and open accounts, as well as for judgments and costs. As to paragraph b, two constructions are possible: It may relate to all unliquidated demands, or only to such as may arise upon such contracts, express or implied, as are covered by paragraph a.\n Certainly paragraph b does not embrace debts of an unliquidated character and which in their nature are not susceptible of being liquidated. Dunber v. Dunbar, \n190 \nU.S. 340, 350\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1084, 1092, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757. Whether the effect of paragraph b is to cause an unliquidated claim which is susceptible of liquidation, but is not literally embraced by paragraph a, to be provable in bankruptcy, we are not called upon to decide, as we are clear that the debt of the plaintiff was embraced within the provision of paragraph a, as one \"founded upon an open account, or upon a contract, express or implied,\" and might have been proved under  63a had plaintiff chosen to waive the tort, and take his place with the other creditors of the estate. He did not elect to do this, however, but brought an action of trover, setting up a fraudulent conversion of his property by defendants. In the first five counts of his declaration he charges a fraudulent conversion of his interest in the stock, and, in the last five counts, that the defendants had induced him to make further payments on such stock in the way of margins, by false and fraudulent representations. \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 188]\n\u00a0\n The question whether the claim thus set forth is barred by the discharge depends upon the proper construction of  17, which declares that the discharge in bankruptcy relieves the bankrupt from all of his \" provable debts,\" except such as \". . . (2) are judgment in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses, or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another , . . . or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity.\"\n Do these words apply to all debts created by the fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation of the bankrupt, or only to such as were created while he was acting as an officer or in some fiduciary capacity? The fact that the 2d subdivision of  17 excepted from the discharge \"all judgments in actions for frauds, or of obtaining property by false pretenses, or false representations,\" indicates quite clearly that, as to frauds in general, it was the intention of Congress only to except from the discharge such as had been reduced to judgment, unless they fall within the 4th subdivision, of those created by the fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation of the bankrupt while acting as an officer or in a flduciary capacity. Unless these words relate back to all the preceding words of the subdivision, namely, the frauds and embezzlements, as well as misappropriations or defalcations, it results that the exception in subd. 2 of all judgments for fraud is meaningless, since such judgments would be based upon a fraud excepted from discharge by subd. 4, whether judgment had been obtained or not.\n This conclusion is fortified by reference to corresponding sections of the former bankrupt acts. Thus, by the 1st section of the act of 1841 ( 5 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 9), the benefits of that act were extended to all persons owing debts \"which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer; or as executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee, or while acting in any other fiduciary capacity.\" It is entirely clear \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 189]\n\u00a0\n that under this section a discharge was not denied to the bankrupt by reason of debts fraudulently contracted, but only to such as were created by his defalcation as an officer, or while acting in a fiduciary capacity.\n We may remark here, in passing, that ever since the case of Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 How. 202, 11 L. ed. 236, this court has held that a commission merchant and factor who sells for others is not indebted in a fiduciary capacity within the bankruptcy acts by withholding the money received for property sold by him. This rule was made under the bankruptcy act of 1841, and has since been repeated many times under subsequent acts. Neal v. Clark, \n95 U.S. 708\n, 24 L. ed. 586; Hennequin v. Clews, \n111 U.S. 679\n, 28 L. ed. 567, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Noble v. Hammond, \n129 U.S. 68\n, 32 L. ed. 623, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 235; Upshur v. Briscoe, \n138 U.S. 375\n, 34 L. ed. 934, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 313,-as well as in cases in the state courts, too numerous for citation.\n Under the bankruptcy act of 1867 the list of debts excluded from the operation of the discharge was considerably larger. In  33, Revised Statutes, 5117, it was declared that--\n\"No debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in any fiduciary character, shall be discharged under this act; but the debt may be proved, and the dividend thereon shall be a payment on account of said debt.\" [14 Stat. at L. 533, chap. 176.]\n\n The language of this section is so clear as to require no construction. It is plain and explicit to the effect that the fraud and embezzlement of the bankrupt need not have been committed by him while acting as an officer or in a fiduciary character, and that this character relates only to his defalcation. But, under the act of 1898, there is no such severance in the fourth paragraph as would authorize us to say that the term \"fiduciary capacity\" did not extend back to the words \"fraud, embezzlement, and misappropriation.\" It was the opinion of the supreme court of Illinois that \"a mere change in phraseology, apparently for the sake of brevity, rendering the meaning somewhat obscure, cannot be regarded as showing a legislative intent to depart so radically from precedents es- \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 190]\n\u00a0\n tablished by previous bankruptcy legislation and judicial decisions as to provide that debts created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt should be released by his discharge in bankruptcy, unless such fraud or embezzlement should be committed while the bankrupt was acting as a public officer, or in a fiduciary capacity.\"\n Our own view, however, is that a change in phraseology creates a presumption of a change in intent, and that Congress would not have used such different language in  17 from that used in  33 of the act of 1867, without thereby intending a change of meaning. The view generally taken by the bankruptcy courts has been that the terms \"officer\" and \"fiduciary capacity\" extend to all the claims mentioned in paragraph 4, and are not confined to cases of defalcation. Re Rhutassel, 2 N. B. N. Rep. 381, 96 Fed. 599; Rc Lewensohn, 99 Fed. 73; Re Hirschman, 2 N. B. N. Rep. 1123, 104 Fed. 69; Re Cole, 3 N. B. N. Rep. 580, 106 Fed. 837; Re Freche, 109 Fed. 620; Hargadine-McKittrick Dry Goods co. v. Hudson, 111 Fed. 361. This is the natural and grammatical reading of the clause.\n The cases in the state courts are almost uniformly to the same effect. Thus in J. C. Smith & W. Co. v. Lambert, 69 N. J. L. 487, 55 Atl. 88, the defendant pleaded to an action on a book account his discharge in bankruptcy, to which the plaintiff replied that the cause of action was created by the fraud of the defendant. The supreme court of New Jersey held the replication to be insufficient. \"We think,\" said the court, \"that under  17 of the bankrupt law, to which reference has been made, there is no provision that would except from the discharge the debt upon which the present suit is brought.\"\n In Morse v. Kaufman, 100 Va. 218, 40 S. E. 916, it was pleaded against the discharge that the goods were procured by false pretenses. After holding that the case had not fallen within subd. 2 of  17, as there was no judgment for fraud, the supreme court of Virginia observed:\n\"It would seem to be equally clear that the demand of plaintiffs in error is not within the exception of subd. 4 \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 191]\n\u00a0\n of  17. It is not pretended that the claim was created by the bankrupt's 'fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity.\"\n\n\"The contention that 'fraud' should be segregated from the qualifying language 'while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity' is without merit. Such interpretation would not only destroy the grammatical construction of the sentence and contravene its plain meaning, but would likewise be inconsistent with paragraph 2 of the same section, that a creditor should have obtained a judgment in an action for fraud in order to override a discharge in bankruptcy.\"\n\n A like construction was given to subd. 4 by the supreme court of Missouri in Goodman v. Herman, 172 Mo. 344, 60 L. R. A. 885, 72 S. W. 546, by the supreme court of Minnesota in Gee v. Gee, 84 Minn. 384, 87 N. W. 1116, by that of Rhode Island in Crosby v. Miller, 25 R. I. 172, 55 Atl. 328, and by the supreme court of New York, fourth department, in Re Bullis, 68 App. Div. 508, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1047. In this case the question was discussed at considerable length, the court saying:\n\"If any debt created by fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation is to be excepted from the application of the statute, then there is no necessity of subd. 2, making a judgment essential to prevent the granting of the discharge under the statute.\"\n\n We have not overlooked the fact that the New York supreme court of the first department reached a different conclusion in Frey v. Torrey, 70 App. Div. 166, 75 N. Y. Supp. 40, affirmed by the court of appeals in a per curiam opinion, 175 N. Y. 501, 67 N. E. 1082, but, so far as we know, this is the only case that supports the construction given to  17 by the supreme court of Illinois.\n Why an ordinary claim for fraud should be released by the discharge, while a judgment for fraud is not released, is not altogether clear, although this distinction may have been created to avoid the necessity of going into conflicting evidence upon the subject of fraud; while in cases of judgments for \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 192]\n\u00a0\n frauds the judgment itself would be evidence of the fraudulent character of the claim. If a creditor has a claim against a debtor for goods sold which would ordinarily be covered by a discharge in bankruptcy, he is strongly tempted to allege, and if possible to prove, that the goods were purchased under a misrepresentation of the assets of the buyer, and thus to make out a claim for fraud which would not be discharged in bankruptcy. It was probably this contingency which induced Congress to enact that an alleged fraud of this kind should be reduced to judgment before it could be set up in bar of a discharge.\n The intent of Congress in changing the language of the act of 1867 seems to have been to restore the act of 1841, which, as already observed, extended the benefits of the law to every debtor who had not been guilty of defalcation as a public officer or in a fiduciary capacity, the act of 1898 adding, however, to the excepted class those against whom a judgment for fraud had been obtained.\n Some stress is laid by the supreme court of Illinois upon the punctuation of subd. 4,  17, presumably upon the insertion of a comma after the word \"misappropriation,\" thereby indicating a severance of that which precedes from that which follows. While we do not deny that punctuation may shed some light upon the construction of a statute (Joy v. St. Louis, \n138 \nU.S. 1, 32\n, 34 S. L. ed. 843, 852, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243), we do not think it is entitled to weight in this case. In the enumeration of persons or things in acts of Congress it has been the custom for many years to insert a comma before the final \"and\" or \"or\" which precedes the last thing enumerated, apparently for greater precision, but without special significance. So little is punctuation a part of statutes that courts will read them with such stops as will give effect to the whole. Doe ex dem. Willis v. Martin, 4 Term Rep. 65, 2 Revised Rep. 324; Hammock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n105 \nU.S. 77, 84\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1111, 1113; United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 33 S. L. ed. 1080, 1083, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625; United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 21 L. ed. 728.\n\n 2. \nBut it is strenuously insisted by the plaintiff that a claim \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 193]\n\u00a0\n for the conversion of personal property is not within the scope of  17, because it is not a \"provable debt\" within the definition of  63a. Did the latter section stand alone, there would be some ground for saying that a claim, though \"founded upon an open account, or upon a contract, express or implied,\" would not be a provable debt, if plaintiff elected to treat the conversion as fraudulent, and sue in trover, though he might have chosen to waive the tort, and bring an action for a balance due on account. An early English case (Parker v. Crole, 5 Being. 63, 2 Moore & P. 150) is cited to the effect that the operation of the discharge is determined by the election of the creditor to sue in assumpsit or case. A like ruling was made in certain cases under the bankruptcy acts of 1841 and 1867. Williamson v. Dickens, 27 N. C. (15 Ired. L.) 259; Hughes v. Oliver, 8 Pa. 426; Bradner v. Strang, 89 N. Y. 299-307.\n But we think that  63a, defining provable debts, must be read in connection with  17, limiting the operation of discharges, in which the provable character of claims for fraud in general is recognized, by excepting from a discharge claims for frauds which have been reduced to judgment, or which were committed by the bankrupt while acting as an officer, or in a fiduciary capacity. If no fraud could be made the basis of a provable debt, why were certain frauds excepted from the operation of a discharge? We are, therefore, of opinion that if a debt originates or is \" founded upon an open account or upon a contract, express or implied,\" it is provable against the bankrupt's estate, though the creditor may elect to bring his action in trover, as for a fraudulent conversion, instead of in assumpsit, for a balance due upon an open account. It certainly could not have been the intention of Congress to extend the operation of the discharge under  17 to debts that were not provable under  63a. It results from the construction we have given the latter section that all debts originating upon an open account or upon a contract, express or implied, are provable, though plaintiff elect to bring his action for fraud. \n\n[195 U.S. 176, 194]\n\u00a0\n In the case under consideration defendants purchased, under the instructions of the plaintiff, certain stocks, and opened an account with him, charging him with commission and interest, and crediting him with amounts received as margins. Subsequently, and without the knowledge of the plaintiff, they sold these stocks, and thereby converted them to their own use. Without going into the details of the facts, it is evident that the plaintiff might have sued them in an action on contract, charging them with the money advanced and with the value of the stock; or in an action of trover, based upon their conversion. For reasons above given, we do not think that his election to sue in tort deprived his debt of its provable character, and that, as there is no evidence that the frauds perpetrated by the defendants were committed by them in an official or fiduciary capacity, plaintiff's claim against them was discharged by the proceedings in bankruptcy.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n accrued after the filing of the petition, and up to the time of the entry of such judgments.\n (b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, and my thereafter be proved and allowed against his estate. \n\n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRONIN v.

Ritter for defendants in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 108, 112]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendants in error, who were officers of the city of Denver, to restrain them from enforcing an ordinance of the city on the ground that the ordinance was 'contrary to the provision of the Constitution of the state of Colorado and amendments thereto, and contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States,' and 'contrary to the laws of the state of Colorado, guaranteeing civil rights to all persons, and contrary to other statutes of the state of Colorado.'\n A preliminary injunction was alllowed. It was made perpetual upon hearing, by decree of the court. The decree was reversed by the supreme court of the state, and this writ of error was then sued out. \n\n[192 U.S. 108, 113]\n\u00a0\n Sections 745 and 746 of article 15 of the ordinance of Denver, which are complained of and attacked, are as follows:\n'Sec. 745. Each and every liquor saloon, dram shop, or tippling house keeper, . . . who shall have or keep, in connection with or as part of such liquor saloon, dram shop, or tippling house, any wine room or other place, either with or without door or doors, curtain or curtains, or screen of any kind, into which any female person shall be permitted to enter from the outside, or from such liquor saloon, dram shop, or tippling house, and there be supplied with any kind of liquor whatsoever, shall, upon conviction, be fined as hereinafter provided.\n\n'Sec. 746. No person . . . having charge or control of any liquor saloon or place where intoxicating or malt liquors are sold or given away, or any place adjacent thereto, or connected therewith in any manner whatsoever, either by doors or otherwise, shall suffer or permit any female person to be or remain in such liquor saloon, dram shop, tippling house, or other place where intoxicating or malt liquors are sold or given away, for the purpose of there being supplied with any kind of liquor whatsoever. No person owning or having charge or control of any liquor saloon, dram shop, or tippling house shall employ or procure, or cause to be employed or procured, any female person to wait or in any manner attend on any person in any dram shop, tippling house, or liquor saloon, or in any place adjacent thereto or connected therewith where intoxicating or malt liquors are sold or given away, nor shall any female person be or remain in any dram shop, tippling house, liquor saloon, or place adjacent thereto or connected therewith, and wait or attend on any person, or solicit drinks in any such place.'\n\n The supreme court held that those sections did not violate the Constitution of the state, and that they were authorized by the statutes of the state, and sustained the validity of the ordinance against the contention that it violated the Constitution of the United States, on the ground that it was enacted \n\n[192 U.S. 108, 114]\n\u00a0\n in the exercise of the police power of the state. Declaring the laws of the state in regard to liquor selling, the court said:\n'Under the license laws of this state no one may engage in the business of selling liquor without a license. He has no absolute right to sell at all. It is only a privilege he gets when a license is granted. The city of Denver, under its charter, has the exclusive power to prohibit, restrain, tax, and regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors. It may exercise that power to prohibit the sale altogether; or, if it sees fit, it may regulate the sale and impose such conditions as it deems necessary. Under these license laws, one may not engage in the liquor traffic as of common right, but may do so only upon compliance with prescribed regulations, and if he applies for a license under which only he may lawfully sell, he is held to take that license with whatever restrictions or limitations are imposed by the authority which, and which only, can give him the coveted privilege. One of the conditions which the charter of Denver requires to be inserted in every liquor license is the one of which plaintiff complains.' [29 Colo. 495, 69 Pac. 592.]\n\n This, the court decided, disposed of the complaint of plaintiff in error. In other words, that the restrictions of the ordinance were conditions of his license, and by accepting the license he accepted the conditions, and no rights of his were infringed. 'The traffic in it ( liquor) is unlawful without a license, and it may be prohibited in Denver,' was the unequivocal declaration of the court.\n What cause of action, then, has plaintiff in error? He is not a female nor delegated to champion any grievance females may have under the ordinance, if they have any. The right to sell liquor by retail to anybody depends upon the laws of the state, and they have affixed to that right the condition expressed in the ordinance. But even if plaintiff in error were not in such situation he cannot resist the ordinance. We said in Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 U.S. 86\n, 34 L. ed. 620, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13:\n'The sale of such liquors in this way [by retail] has therefore been, at all times, by the courts of every state, considered \n\n[192 U.S. 108, 115]\n\u00a0\n as the proper subject of legislative regulation. Not only may a license be exacted from the keeper of the saloon before a glass of his liquors can be thus disposed of, but restrictions may be imposed as to the class of persons to whom they may be sold, and the hours of the day and the days of the week on which the saloons may be opened. Their sale in that form may be absolutely prohibited. It is a question of public expediency and public morality, and not of Federal law. The police power of the state is fully competent to regulate the business,-to mitigate its evils or to suppress it entirely. There is no inherent right in a citizen to thus sell intoxicating liquors by retail; it is not a privilege of a citizen of the state or of a citizen of the United States.'\n\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRONIN v.

Adulterations.-No person shall, within the state, manufacture, produce, compound, brew, distill, have, sell, or offer for sale any adulterated food or drug. An article shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of this act, . . . in the case of food , . . . (6) if it be colored or coated, or polished or powdered, whereby damage is concealed, or it is made to appear better than it really is or of greater value.' (Laws of the state of New York of 1893, ch. 661,  41, being chapter 25 of the General Laws of the state of New York.)\n With these provisions in force, in July, 1894, the firm of Crossman & Brothers, hereafter referred to as the sellers, residents of New York city, by contract made in New York, sold to the firm of Theodore G. Lurman & Company, hereafter referred to as the buyers, residents of Baltimore, five hundred bags of Rio coffee, one half the bags to be No. 8 grade and the other half No. 9 grade. It was stipulated that the coffee was to be shipped from Rio Janeiro to New York city by a designated steamer, the coffee to be sound or to be made sound by the sellers. The grades 8 and 9 referred to in the memorandum of sale were standard types, bearing those numbers, established by the Coffee Exchange of the city of New York, and it was agreed that the coffee was to be of the average of such types, and differences arising on the subject were to be determined by a 'grader,' to be selected by each of the parties, the two to select a third in the event of a disagreement, his decision to be conclusive. It was stipulated that on the arrival of the steamer and the storage of the coffee in New York the buyers were to have the advantage of the first month's storage and fire insurance free of expense. \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n In due time the named steamer reached the port of New York, and the five hundred bags of coffee were stored and delivery tendered in New York city to the buyers. Some of the coffee was accepted and the remainder was rejected, on the ground that it was adulterated, because it had been artificially colored by coating the beans with a yellow wash. Without going into the details of what transpired between the parties as a result of the refusal to accept the coffee, it suffices, for this case, to say that ultimately the graders provided for in the contract were named, and on their disagreement a third was selected, who decided that, although the coffee had been coated with the wash, its average quality was yet equal to the specified types of the Coffee Exchange referred to in the contract. The buyers refused to abide by this finding, and to accept delivery and pay for the adulterated coffee. The sellers then disposed of the coffee for account of the buyers, and commenced this suit to recover the difference between the amount produced by the alleged sale and the contract price. During the course of the litigation two trials were had, and the cause was twice passed on by the appellate division of the supreme court in and for the first judicial department. On the first hearing in the supreme court it was held, in accord with a decision of the court of appeals of the state of New York, rendered in a collateral controversy which grew out of the refusal to accept the coffee (Re Lurman, 149 N. Y. 588, 44 N. E. 1125), that if the coffee was adulterated, within the statute of the state of New York, the buyers were not bound to accept, despite the finding of the grader that it conformed to the types of the Coffee Exchange, referred to in the contract. Finally, all incidental questions being eliminated, the cause was tried on the distinct issue whether the coffee was adulterated within the provisions of the statute. There was a verdict and judgment for the buyers, which was affirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court in and for the first judicial department. The cause having been then taken to the court of appeals of the state of New York, the court affirmed the \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n judgment of the supreme court, and remitted the record to that court. 171 N. Y. 329, 63 N. E. 1097. Because of such remittitur this writ of error to the supreme court is prosecuted to review the judgment of the court of appeals.\n Concerning the facts of the case the court of appeals said (p. 335, N. E. p. 1100).\n'The coffee tendered by the plaintiffs, which was rejected, was of a low grade, containing many poor, withered, and black beans. It, confessedly, was colored and the beans coated with a yellowish substance. It is not contended that the coloring matter improved the taste or added to the value of the coffee. It is claimed that the only purpose of the coloring was to hide the character of the poor beans and to make them appear of the same character as the good coffee. The jury has found by its verdict that it was so colored as to conceal the damaged portions, or made it to appear better than it really was, or of greater value to the ordinary, untrained observer. In other words, that it was adulterated for the purposes of fraud and deception.'\n\n Applying the provisions of the health laws of the state of New York concerning the adulteration of food products already referred to, it was decided that the court below had correctly held that there was no obligation on the part of the buyer to take delivery and pay for the coffee if fraudulently colored in violation of the prohibitions of the statute. Coming to consider the contention of the sellers, that the provision of the law of the state in question was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, the court of appeals said (p. 332, N. E. p. 1098):\n'The states have no power to regulate commerce with foreign countries or with each other. This power has been delegated to the Congress of the United States, and that body can, by law, determine what shall or shall not be permitted to be imported. With the right of importation follows the right of sale in original packages, and therefore the states cannot prohibit the sale of articles of commerce within their borders. \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 196]\n\u00a0\n The states cannot, under the guise of inspection, or under their reserved police powers, prohibit the importation into their jurisdictions of sound meat, under the pretense that it may be damaged or decayed, or Texas cattle for fear they may be diseased, or spirituous or malt liquors for fear that they may intoxicate, or oleomargarine for fear it may be adulterated. Hannibal & St. J. R. Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n, 24 L. ed. 527; Bowman v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. \n125 U.S. 465\n, 31 L. ed. 700, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 823, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689, 1062; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 U.S. 100\n, 34 L. ed. 128, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 36, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, \n171 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 49, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757.\n\n Having thus fully conceded the plenary operation of the Constitution of the United States upon interstate and foreign commerce, the court proceeded to decide that the statute of the state of New York which it upheld was no repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, because the state, in its enactment, but exerted its reserved police power to legislate for the protection of the health and safety of the community, and to provide against deception or fraud. In support of this theory the court cited from the decisions of this court, to which it had referred, as showing the general rule, and additionally fortified its conclusion by reference to, and citations from, the opinion of this court in Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 U.S. 461\n, 39 L. ed. 223, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 590, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154.\n All but three of the many propositions embraced in the assignment of errors and urged at bar rest on the contention that the court of appeals misconceived the extent of the police power of the state, and therefore erroneously decided that the law of the state of New York which was applied to the case was not repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. We shall not at any length undertake to review the argument made at bar to sustain this proposition, since its unsoundness will be more fully demonstrated by a mere reference to the previous decisions of this court, upon which the court below based its conclusions. Indeed, every contention here urged to show that the law of New York is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States was fully and expressly considered and negatived by the decision of this court in Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 U.S. 461\n, 39 L. ed. 223, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 590, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154. In that case a law of the \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 197]\n\u00a0\n state of Massachusetts forbidding the sale of oleomargarine which was artifically colored was applied to a sale in Massachusetts of an original package of that article which had been manufactured in, and shipped from, the state of Illinois. In the course of a full review of the previous cases relating to the subject it was said (p. 472, L. ed. p. 227, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 600, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 158):\n'If there be any subject over which it would seem the states ought to have plenary control, and the power to legislate in respect to which it ought not to be supposed was intended to be surrendered to the general government, it is the protection of the people against fraud and deception in the sale of food products. Such legislation may, indeed, indirectly or incidentally, affect trade in such products transported from one state to another state. But that circumstance does not show that laws of the character alluded to are inconsistent with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states. For, as said by this court in Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99, 103\n, 23 S. L. ed. 819, 820: 'In conferring upon Congress the regulation of commerce, it was never intended to cut the states off from legislating on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens, though the legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of the country. Legislation, in a great variety of ways, may affect commerce and persons engaged in it without constituting a regulation of it within the meaning of the Constitution. . . . And it may be said, generally, that the legislation of a state, not directed against commerce or any of its regulations, but relating to the rights, duties, and liabilities of citizens, and only indirectly and remotely affecting the operations of commerce, is of obligatory force upon citizens within its territorial jurisdiction, whether on land or water, or engaged in commerce, foreign or interstate, or in any other pursuit.\"\n\n Again, it was said (p. 478, L. ed. p. 229, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 606, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 160):\n'And yet it is supposed that the owners of a compound which has been put in a condition to cheat the public into believing that it is a particular article of food in daily use and eagerly sought by people in every condition of life are pro- \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 198]\n\u00a0\n tected by the Constitution in making a sale of it against the will of the state in which it is offered for sale, because of the circumstance that it is an original package, and has become a subject of ordinary traffic. We are unwilling to accept this view. We are of opinion that it is within the power of a state to exclude from its markets any compound manufactured in another state, which has been artificially colored or adulterated so as to cause it to look like an article of food in general use, and the sale of which may, by reason of such coloration or adulteration, cheat the general public into purchasing that which they may not intend to buy. The Constitution of the United States does not secure to any one the privilege of defrauding the public.'\n\n The assertion that the statute of the state of New York which the court below applied is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States being thus shown to be devoid of merit, there remains only to be considered the three propositions to which we have previously adverted. We shall briefly consider and dispose of them.\n 1st. It is insisted that, even although it was in the power of the state of New York to legislate for the prevention of fraud and deception by forbidding the sale of the adulterated food products, such prohibition could only operate upon contracts made within, or intended to be executed within, the state, and as the contract here in controversy was not of such character, therefore the law of the state of New York was erroneously held to control. This proposition is based on the assumption that because the buyers of the coffee were residents of Maryland, therefore the contract must be treated as having been made for the purpose of securing the shipment of the coffee from Rio Janeiro to the residence of the buyers, hence the city of New York was referred to in the contract merely as the port of entry. It is insisted, per contra, that this proposition was not relied upon at the trial, nor called to the attention of the court of appeals of the state of New York, and should not be now considered, because if it had been raised below it would \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 199]\n\u00a0\n have been met by proof showing that the buyers, although residents in Maryland, were engaged in carrying on a business for the sale of coffee in New York city. The suggestion that the proposition was not made below is borne out by the fact that it was not referred to by the court of appeals of the state of New York or in the serveral opinions handed down by the supreme court of the state of New York during the course of the protracted litigation which the cause has engendered. Be this as it may, however, we think the proposition is devoid of merit. The contract of sale was made in New York; the storage and delivery in the city of New York was therein provided for. It was clearly, therefore, a New York contract, and governed by the law of New York.\n 2d. It is urged that, even although there was power in the state of New York to legislate on the subject of adulteration of food, such legislation ceased to be operative as regards food products imported into the United States through the channels of foreign commerce after the passage of the act of Congress approved August 30, 1890, 'providing for the inspection of meats for exportation, prohibiting the importation of adulterated articles of food or drink, and authorizing the President to make proclamation in certain cases.' 26 Stat. at L. 414, chap. 839, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3185. The second section of that act, it is insisted, does not exclude from importation adulterated food, but simply adulterated food which is mixed with any poisonous or noxious chemical, drug, or other ingredient injurious to health, which, it is urged, was not the case with the coffee in question. The language of the section upon which this contention is based is as follows:\n'That it shall be unlawful to import into the United States any adulterated or unwholesome food or drug, or any vinous, spirituous, or malt liquors, adulterated or mixed with any poisonous or noxious chemical, drug, or other ingredient injurious to health.'\n\n We think it unnecessary to determine whether the statute lends even color to the proposition, since we think it is clear that its effect, whatever be its import, was not to deprive the \n\n[192 U.S. 189, 200]\n\u00a0\n state of its police power to legislate for the benefit of its people in the prevention of deception and fraud, and thus to control sales made within the state of articles so adulterated as to come within the valid prohibitions of the state statute.\n 3d. In the trial court the plaintiff tendered evidence to demonstrate that there was a demand in some portions of the country for artificially colored coffee, and, to the ruling of the court excluding such testimony as irrelevant, exception was saved. Although the court of appeals, in its opinion, did not make any special reference to the subject, it is insisted that the question was called to its attention, and that, in affirming the judgment, it in effect sustained the action of the trial court in excluding the testimony, and thereby deprived the plaintiff of rights secured under the Constitution of the United States. The effect of the evidence, it is argued, had it been admitted, would have been to show that coffee artificially colored as a means of fraud and deception was a recognized article of commerce, and therefore the right to deal in it was protected by the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and such dealings could not, therefore, be controlled by the state law. To state the proposition we think is to answer it.\n It, moreover, is disposed of by the decisions of this court to which we have previously referred. Besides, the question which the case involved was the right of the sellers to contract for and deliver in the state of New York an article so adulterated and fraudulent as to be within the prohibitions of the law of New York. Further, the proof tending to show that coffee so adulterated and artificially colored as to be the convenient means of accomplishing fraud and deceit was in demand in some places outside of the state of New York could have no legitimate tendency to cause the adulterated and fraudulently deceptive article to become legitimate commerce.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCROWLEY v.

The punishment for the offense here charged was imprisonment at hard labor for one year, and not exceeding five years.\n After the return of the indictment, the accused filed a plea in abatement, which questioned the competency of certain jurors who participated in the finding of the indictment.\n As the action of the court on that plea constitutes the controlling question in the case, the plea is given in full, as follows:\n'Now comes the defendant, Harold Crowley, and pleads in abatement to the indictment returned herein, and says that on Monday, the 8th day of April, 1901, there appeared in this court at San Juan, it being the first day of said term, the following-named persons: Manuel Romero Haxthausen, Pedro Fernandez, Alex.

Within a few minutes thereafter the marshal brought into court Frank Antonsanti (returned as Antonio Santi and Frank Santi, as appears by the minutes of this court), Hugo Stern, and William Bowen, the said persons not having been then and there bystanders in the court. The said panel then being incomplete, the marshal placed W. H.

Holt, Jr., Frank Antonsanti, alias Frank Santi, alias Antonio Santi, William Bowen.\n\n'Defendant says that no writs of venire facias were directed by the court against the said last above named persons from \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n the clerk's office, signed by the clerk or his deputy, nor returned in the manner provided by Revised Statutes,  803 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 625 ). Defendant says that he was not present in court at the time of the selection, summoning, and impaneling of the jury aforesaid, and has had no opportunity to make any challenges to the same as the members thereof, because he did not know of said action, and was not at the time represented by counsel, but that he has this day learned of the aforesaid acts for the first time, and therefore immediately presents this plea.\n\n'Defendant says that he has been and would be greatly prejudiced by the improper and illegal selection and impaneling of such grand jury as aforesaid, as it was composed at the time aforesaid of persons disqualified to act, and who were not residents or taxpayers of Porto Rico, as required by law, and because of their unfamiliarities with the island and the conditions and circumstances,-material matters in this case, and relevant thereto,-some of said jurors as aforesaid having been but a few months in the island, and temporarily sojourning herein.\n\n'In addition to W. H. Holt, Jr., and William Baun, the following gentlemen of the grand jury were American citizens: John D. H. Luce, E. L. Arnold, Henry W. Dooly, J. Ramon Latimer, foreman thereof, Charles H. Post, Frank Antonsanti; by reason of which and their supposed knowledge of such practices by grand juries in the courts of the United States, might, and, as defendant believes, did, contend the deliberations of said jury so as to induce a finding of indictment where the Porto Rican citizens thereof might not have otherwise done.'\n\n The United States demurred to the plea upon the ground that the matters set forth in it, so far as they controlled or were applicable to the summoning and impaneling of a grand jury in the court below, disclosed no illegality therein, and constituted no reason why the accused should not be required to plead to the indictment.\n The demurrer to the plea was sustained, and the plea overruled. The defendant then demurred to the indictment, and, the demurrer being overruled, he pleaded to the jurisdiction \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 466]\n\u00a0\n of the court upon the ground that it had no authority to proceed at its then special term, but could only proceed at a regular term. That plea was also overruled. The accused was then arraigned and pleaded not guilty, and a trial was had, resulting in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence to four years' imprisonment in the penitentiary.\nMr. Richard Crowley for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question is one of the jurisdiction of this court; the government insisting that, under existing statutes, we are without authority to review the judgment in this case.\n By the 35th section of the Foraker act of April 12th, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 85, chap. 191), it is provided, among other things, that writs of error and appeals to this court from the final decisions of the district court of the United States shall be allowed in all cases where 'an act of Congress is brought in question, and the right claimed thereunder is denied.' In this case that act was brought in question by the contention of the parties,-the contention of the accused being, in substance, that, pursuant to that act of Congress, the court below, in the matter of the qualifications of grand jurors, should have been controlled by the provisions of the local law relating to jurors, in connection with the statutes of the United States relating to the organization of grand juries, and the trial and disposition of criminal causes; and the court below deciding that, notwithstanding the Foraker act, the local act of January 31st, 1901 referred to in the plea, was not applicable to this prosecution, and that the grand jury finding the indictment, if a grand jury was necessary, was organized consistently with the laws of the United States under which the court proceeded. It \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 467]\n\u00a0\n thus appears that the accused claimed a right under the act of Congress and under the Revised Statutes of the United States, which, it is alleged, was denied to him in the court below. This court has, therefore, jurisdiction to inquire whether there is anything of substance in that claim.\n The question presented by the opposing views of the parties is not free from difficulty. By  14 of the Foraker act it is provided that the statutory laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, except as otherwise provided, shall have the same force and effect in Porto Rico as in the United States.  14. And by  34 it is provided that, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, the district court of the United States for Porto Rico shall have jurisdiction 'in all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.'  34.\n Turning to the statutes of the United States, we find that 'jurors to serve in the courts of the United States, in each state respectively, shall have the same qualifications' (subject to certain provisions and exceptions not material to be mentioned here) 'as jurors of the highest court of law in that state may have and be entitled to at the time when such jurors for service in the courts of the United States are summoned.'  800 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 623).\n Taking these statutory provisions all together, and having regard to the general scope of the Foraker act, it is manifest that Congress intended that criminal prosecutions in the district court of the United States in Porto Rico, for offenses against the United States, should be conducted in the same manner as like prosecutions in the circuit courts of the United States; the court in Porto Rico recognizing any valid existing local statute relating to the qualifications for jurors, just as a circuit court of the United States, in criminal prosecutions would be controlled ( Rev. Stat.  800, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 623) in respect of the qualifications of jurors, by the applicable statutes of the state in which it was sitting. \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 468]\n\u00a0\n So that we must inquire whether there was in existence any local statute relating to the qualifications of jurors by which the court below should have been controlled.\n The plea in abatement, referring to certain provisions in a statute of Porto Rico prescribing the qualifications of jurors, states that it took effect January 31st, 1901. That is a mistake. It is true that the statute was passed on that day, but it did not take effect until April 1st, 1901. Rev. Stat. & Codes of Porto Rico, 1902, pp. 172, 210,  160.\n The plea correctly states that by that statute-the authority of the legislature of Porto Rico to pass it not being questioned-it was provided that a person was not competent to act as a juror who was not a male citizen of the United States or of Porto Rico, of the age of twenty-one years, and not more than sixty years; who had not been a resident of the island one year and of the district or county ninety days before being selected and returned; or who was not assessed on the last assessment roll of the district or county on property of the value of at least $200, belonging to him.  3.\n In a brief opinion, made part of the record, the court below referred to the date on which the local statute took effect,-April 1st, 1901,-and stated that the record showed that the venire of grand jurors for the term was executed, and the jurors summoned, prior to that date. This must be construed as applying only to those jurors who were summoned under the regular venire; for it is distinctly shown by the record that the court convened April 8th, 1901, after the local statute went into effect, and that of those participating in the finding of the indictment, four- Antonsanti, Stern, Bowen, and Holt-were summoned by the marshal after that date, under the order of the court, to complete the panel of the grand jury. And the demurrer to the plea admits that Antonsanti, Bowen, and Holt were of those thus specially summoned after the court convened, and were not, when selected as jurors, assessed on the last assessment as owners of property of the required value; and that Holt had not been a resident of the island for one \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 469]\n\u00a0\n year prior to his being summoned to serve on the grand jury. It thus appears that after the local statute took effect three persons were summoned by the marshal and put on the grand jury who were disqualified by that statute to serve. We perceive no reason why the district court of the United States for Porto Rico should not have followed that statute when organizing the grand jury. It was then the law of Porto Rico. There was no difficulty in applying its provisions prescribing the qualifications of jurors to pending criminal prosecutions in the court below. One of the functions of that court was to enforce the laws of Porto Rico. If the court had given effect to the above act, and held those to be disqualified as jurors who were declared by its provisions to be incompetent, then it would have proceeded-as it was required by the Revised Statutes of the United States and by the Foraker act to proceed-'in the same manner as a circuit court' of the United States, sitting in a state, would proceed under the law of such state prescribing the qualifications of jurors. But it did not proceed in that manner. It refused to follow the local statute.\n It remains now to inquire whether the objection to the jurors above named was taken in the proper way, and in due time. Can such an objection be made, as was done here, by plea in abatement after the return of the indictment? Upon this point the authorities are not in harmony. The question is not controlled by any statute, and must depend on principles of general law applicable to criminal proceedings in civilized countries.\n Some of the cases have gone so far as to hold that an objection to the personal qualifications of grand jurors is not available for the accused unless made before the indictment is returned in court. Such a rule would, in many cases, operate to deny altogether the right of an accused to question the qualifications of those who found the indictment against him; for he may not know, indeed, is not entitled, of right, to know, that his acts are the subject of examination by the \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 470]\n\u00a0\n grand jury. In Com. v. Smith, 9 Mass. 107, 109, a case often referred to, the court said that 'objections to the personal qualifications of the jurors, or to the legality of the returns, are to be made before the indictment is found.' But the court took care to observe that the decision was not rested on that ground. And in the later case of Com. v. Parker, 2 Pick. 550, 563, Chief Justice Parker, referring to Com. v. Smith, remarked: 'It is there said that objections to the personal qualifications of the grand jurors, or to the legality of the returns, are to be made before the indictment is found. It is not necessary to apply the remark here, and we have some doubts as to the correctness of it in all cases; and the case in which it was made was determined on another point.'\n One of the earliest cases in this country in which the question arose was that of Com. v. Cherry, 2 Va. Cas. 20, decided in 1815. It was then held that if a grand juror was disqualified, the indictment or presentment, after being found, could be avoided by plea in abatement.\n With rare exceptions this rule is recognized and followed in the different states. It will be appropriate to refer to some of the cases.\n In State v. Symonds, 36 Me. 128, 132, an objection that the indictment was not found by the required number of legal grand jurors being taken on motion in writing, in the nature of a plea of abatement at the arraignment of the accused, was held to be in season and available. Later, in State v. Carver, 49 Me. 588, 594, 77 Am. Dec. 275, it was said that objections to the competency of grand jurors by whom an indictment was found came too late if made after verdict, but must be pleaded in abatement. See also State v. Clough, 49 Me. 577. In State v. Herndon, 5 Blackf. 75, it was ruled that if a grand juror was disqualified for any reason, the accused may, before issue joined, plead the objection in avoidance. In Doyle v. State, 17 Ohio, 222, an objection, by special plea, that one of the grand jurors by whom the indictment was found was disqualified \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 471]\n\u00a0\n qualified to act, was held not to come too late-the court saying that 'no objection can come too late which discloses the fact that a person has been put to answer a crime in a mode violating his legal and constitutional rights.'\n In McQuillen v. State, 8 Smedes & M. 587, 598, the high court of errors and appeals of Mississippi fully considered the question. Chief Justice Sharkey, delivering the judgment of the court, after observing that no one can be called to answer a charge against him unless it has been preferred according to the forms of law, and that anyone indicted by a grand jury can deny their power, said: 'The question is, how is this to be done? A prisoner who is in court, and against whom an indictment is about to be preferred, may undoubtedly challenge for cause; this is not questioned. But the grand jury may find an indictment against a person who is not in court; how is he to avail himself of a defective organization of the grand jury? If he cannot do it by plea, he cannot do it in any way; and the law works unequally by allowing one class of persons to object to the competency of the grand jury, whilst another class has no such privilege. This cannot be. The law furnishes the same security to all, and the same principle which gives to a prisoner in court the right to challenge gives to one who is not in court the right to accomplish the same end by plea; and the current of authorities sustains such a plea. True, some may be found the other way, but it is believed that a large majority of the decisions are in favor of the plea. To the list of authorities cited by counsel may be added the name of Sir Matthew Hale, which would seem to be sufficient to put the question at rest. 2 Hale P. C. 155. Vide also Withipole's Case, Cro. Car. 134, 147.' See also Rawls v. State, 8 Smedes & M. 609.\n The same court, in a later case, sustaining the right of accused to challenge, by plea in abatement, the competency of the grand jury by which he is indicted, said: 'This privilege arises not alone from the legal principles, that indictments not found by twelve good and lawful men at the least are void and \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 472]\n\u00a0\n erroneous at common law, and, therefore, some mode must be left open for ascertaining the fact, but is well sustained as a method of insuring to accused persons a fair and impartial trial. Such persons are not present when the grand jurors are impaneled, perhaps have not been made subjects of complaint or even suspicion. It certainly would not be right to estop a party from pleading a matter to which he could not otherwise except. The interest of an accused person under indictment with the grand jury commences at the time of the finding of the indictment. This is the point of time when, as to him, the legal number of qualified men must exist upon the grand inquest. Indictments not found by at least twelve good and lawful men are void at common law. [Clyncard's Case] 2 Cro. Eliz. 654; [ Robinson v. Bland] 2 Burr. 1088, 2 Hawk P. C. 307. It is said by 2 Hawkins, P. O. chap. 25,  28, p. 312, that if any one of the grand jury, who find an indictment, be within any one of the exceptions in the statute, he vitiates the whole, though ever so many unexceptional persons joined with him in finding it.' Barney v. State, 12 Smedes & M. 68, 72.\n In State v. Seaborn, 15 N. C. (4 Dev. L.) 305, 311, and again in State v. Martin, 24 N. c. (2 Ired. L.) 101, 120, the supreme court of North Carolina, speaking in each case by Chief Justice Ruffin, held that a plea in abatement, filed at the time of arraignment, was an appropriate mode of raising the question of the validity of an indictment as affected by the disqualification of a grand juror.\n A leading case upon the question is Vanhook v. State, 12 Tex. 252, 268. The court there said: 'The better opinion, to be deduced from the authorities to which we have access, seems to be that irregularities in selecting and impaneling a grand jury, which do not relate to the competency of individual jurors, can, in general, only be objected by a challenge to the array. But that the incompetency, or want of the requisite qualifications, of the jurors, may be pleaded in abatement to the indictment. And this doctrine and distinction \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 473]\n\u00a0\n seems founded on principle. It is the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt decided by two competent juries before he is condemned to punishment. It is his right, in the first place, to have the accusation passed upon, before he can be called upon to answer to the charge of crime, by a grand jury composed of good and lawful men. If the jury be not composed of such men as possess the requisite qualifications, he ought not to be put upon his trial upon a charge preferred by them, but should be permitted to plead their incompetency to prefer the charge and put him upon his trial, in avoidance of the indictment. Otherwise he may be compelled to answer to a criminal charge preferred by men who are infamous, or unworthy to be his accusers.'\n In State v. Duncan, 7 Yerg. 271, 275, the accused pleaded in abatement that one of the grand jurors who participated in the finding of the indictment was disqualified. The supreme court of Tennessee, speaking by Chief Justice Catron, afterwards a member of this court, said: 'Suppose an indictment was found by a grand jury, no person composing which was qualified? All will admit the indictment would be merely void in fact, and ought not to be answered if the fact was made legally to appear. So, if any one be incompetent, it is equally void, because the proper number to constitute the grand inquest is wanting; and because he who is incompetent shall not be one of the triers of the offense at any stage of the prosecution. There seems, at some early stage of the proceeding by indictment, to have been some doubt whether the indictment was void because of the incompetency of one of the grand jurors, to set which at rest the 2 Henry IV., chap. 9, enacted 'that any indictment taken by a jury, one of whom is unqualified, shall be altogether void and of no effect.\" See also Mann v. Fairlee, 44 Vt. 672; State v. Williams, 3 Stew. ( Ala.) 454; State v. Bryant, 10 Yerg. 527; State v. Cole, 17 Wis. 674; State v. Brooks, 9 Ala. 10; Jackson v. State, 11 Tex. 261; State v. Freeman, 6 Blackf. 248; 1 Bishop, Crim. Proc.  883, and authorities cited; 1 Am. Crim. Law,  472, \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 474]\n\u00a0\n and authorities cited; 1 Chitty, Crim. Law, 307; Bacon Abr. Indictment, C. Bouvier's ed. p. 53; 2 Hale P. C. 155; 3 Inst. 34; 2 Hawk. P. C. chap. 35 ,  18, 26, 29, 30.\n We are of opinion that the objection here, that grand jurors were disqualified by the statute of Porto Rico, was made in the proper way and in due time. The accused was not in court when the grand jurors were selected and the grand jury impaneled. So far as appears from the record, he was not aware that his case would be taken up by the grand jury. It does not appear he had, prior to the assembling of the grand jury, been arrested for the offenses for which he was indicted. But upon the return of the indictment he was brought to the bar of the court, and gave bond for his appearance and trial. His objection to the qualifications of the grand jurors was made promptly,- days after the indictment was returned,- before he was arraigned, and as soon as he learned of the facts upon which the objection was based. All this was admitted by the demurrer to the plea in abatement. If the objection in this case was not sufficient, then an objection made by plea in abatement prior to arraignment, that a majority or even all of the grand jurors returning an indictment against the accused were disqualified by law, would have been equally unavailing. Such a result is not to be thought of.\n In this connection the government calls attention to  1025 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 720), providing that 'No indictment found and presented by a grand jury in any district or circuit or other court of the United States shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form only, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.' This section can have no bearing on the present case, for the disqualification of a grand juror is prescribed by statute, and cannot be regarded as a mere defect or imperfection in form; it is matter of substance, which cannot be disregarded without prejudice to an accused.\n It is said that under the Spanish law, prior to the cession \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 475]\n\u00a0\n of Porto Rico, indictments and grand juries were unknown; that it was allowable under the law to proceed against an accused by a criminal information; and that the legislative assembly of Porto Rico had not made any alteration of the Spanish law in this particular when the grand jurors in this case were summoned. The contention in this view is that the indictment in question, having been signed by the United States attorney, can be treated as an information. The indictment embodies charges made by grand jurors, and the signature of the United States attorney merely attests the action of the grand jury, whereas an information rests upon the responsibility of the attorney representing the government, and imports an investigation of the facts by him in his official capacity. But, apart from these considerations, we cannot treat the indictment as an information, for the reason, if there were no other, that, as the defendant was accused of an infamous crime against the United States, this prosecution could not have been commenced in a circuit court of the United States except on presentment or indictment of a grand jury; and the positive command of the act of Congress relating to the district court of the United States for Porto Rico, that the court below 'shall proceed in the same manner as a circuit court' of the United States, precluded the prosecution of the accused in the latter court except by presentment or indictment.\n We have seen that some of the grand jurors alleged in the plea of abatement to be disqualified were summoned prior to the date on which the local statute went into effect; and if the local statute were applied to them, they would have been held incompetent to act as jurors. But there is some ground to hold, under  800 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 623), that if they were qualified when summoned, then they did not become disqualified by reason of anything in the local statute which went into operation after they were summoned. By what law the qualifications of those particular jurors were to be tested we need not determine; for what has been said \n\n[194 U.S. 461, 476]\n\u00a0\n as to disqualified jurors summoned after the court convened, and after the local statute went into operation, and who were nevertheless permitted to participate in the finding of the indictment, is sufficient to dispose of the case.\n For the reasons stated, and without considering other questions arising upon the plea in abatement as well as upon the record, we adjudge only that the presence on the grand jury of persons summoned after the local statute took effect, and who were disqualified by that statute,- those facts having been seasonably brought to the attention of the court by a plea in abatement filed before arraignment,-vitiated the indictment.\n The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer to the plea in abatement, and for such further proceedings as may be consistent with law.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDALY v.

The organic act of the territory of Hawaii repealed all laws of the Republic of Hawaii which conferred exclusive fishing rights, subject, however, to vested rights, and it required actions to be started within \n\n[194 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n two years by those who claimed such rights. Act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339,  95, 96 (31 Stat. at L. 141, 160). At the trial the presiding judge directed a verdict for the defendant. Exceptions were taken but were overruled by the supreme court of the territory, and the case comes here by writ of error.\n The right claimed is a right within certain metes and bounds to set apart one species of fish to the owner's sole use, or, alternatively, to put a taboo on all fishing within the limits for certain months, and to receive from all fishermen one third of the fish taken upon the fishing grounds. A right of this sort is somewhat different from those familiar to the common law, but it seems to be well known to Hawaii, and, if it is established, there is no more theoretical difficulty in regarding it as property and a vested right than there is regarding any ordinary easement or profit a prendre as such. The plaintiff's claim is not to be approached as if it were something anomalous or monstrous, difficult to conceive and more difficult to admit. Moreover, however, anomalous it is, if it is sanctioned by legislation, if the statutes have erected it into a property right, property it will be, and there is nothing for the courts to do except to recognize it as a right. Wedding v. Meyler, \n192 U.S. 573\n, 583, ante, p. 322, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 322.\n The property formerly belonged to Kamehameha IV., from whom it passed to his brother, Lot Kamehameha, and from him by mesne conveyances to the plaintiff. The title of the latter to the ahupuaa is not disputed. He claims the fishery also under a series of statutes and a royal grant. The history is as follows: In 1839 Kamehameha III. took the fishing grounds from Hawaii to Kauai and redistributed them,-those named without the coral reef, and the ocean beyond, to the people; those 'from the coral reef to the seabeach for the landlords and for the tenants of their several lands, but not for others.' The landlord referred to seems to have been the konohiki, or overlord, of an ahupuaa, or large tract like that owned by the plaintiff. It is not necessary to speculate as to what the effect of this act of the king would have been standing alone, he then \n\n[194 U.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n having absolute power. It had, at least, the effect of inaugurating a system, de facto. But in 1846, the monarchy then being constitutional, an act was passed, article 5 of which was entitled 'Of the Public and Private Rights of Piscary.' By the 1st section of this article it was provided again that the same fishing grounds outside the reef should be free to the people, etc.; and then by the second it was enacted that the fishing grounds from the reefs to the beach, or, where there are no reefs, for one mile seaward, 'shall in law be considered the private property of the landlords whose lands, by ancient regulation, belong to the same; in the possession of which private fisheries the said landholders shall not be molested except' etc.\n By  3 'the landholders shall be considered in law to hold said private fisheries for the equal use of themselves and of the tenants on their respective lands; and the tenants shall be at liberty to use the fisheries of their landlords subject to the restrictions in this article imposed.' Then follows a statement of the rights of the landlord as they have been summed up above, and a provision that the landlords shall not have power to lay any tax or to impose any restrictions upon their tenants regarding the private fisheries other than those prescribed.\n The Civil Code of 1859,  387, repeated the enactment of  2, that the fishing grounds within the reef or one mile seaward 'shall, in law, be considered the private property of the konohiki,' etc., in nearly the same words, and other sections codified the regulations just mentioned. There was a later repetition in the Penal Laws of 1897,  1452, etc., and this was in force when the organic act of Congress was passed, repealing, as we have said, the laws conferring exclusive fishing rights, but preserving vested rights.\n The foregoing laws not only use the words 'private property,' but show that they mean what they say by the restrictions cutting down what otherwise would be the incidents of private property. There is no color for a suggestion that they \n\n[194 U.S. 154, 160]\n\u00a0\n created only a revocable license, and if they imported a grant or a confirmation of an existing title, of course the repeal of the laws would not repeal the grant. The argument against their effect was not that in this case the ahupuaa did not belong to the fishery, within the words 'landlords whose lands, by ancient regulation, belong to the same' (the land seems formerly to have been incident to the fishery), but that citizens have no vested rights against the repeal of general laws. This is one of those general truths which become untrue by being inaccurately expressed. A general law may grant titles as well as a special law. It depends on the import and direction of the law. A strong example of the application of the rule intended by the argument is to be found in Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, ante, p. 107, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107, where a railroad company was held to have no vested right to exemptions proclaimed in a general tax act. The statute was construed not to import an offer, covenant, or grant to railroads which might be built in reliance upon it. But if a general law does express such an offer, as it may, the grant is made. If the Hawaii statutes did not import a grant, it is hard to see their meaning.\n However, in this case it is not necessary to invoke the statutes further than to show that, by the law in force since 1846, at least, such rights as the plaintiff claims, and which, as is shown by the evidence, he and his predecessors in title have been exercising for forty years, have been recognized as private property. Such is the view of the leading case, decided in 1858 and acquiesced in, we believe, ever since. Haalelea v. Montgomery, 2 Hawaiian R. 62, 66. In the present instance the plaintiff claims under a royal patent, admitted to have been effective as to whatever, by its true construction, it purported to convey. This patent describes the ahupuaa by metes and bounds, and then the granting clause goes on: 'There is also attached to this land a fishing right in the adjoining sea, which is bounded as follows,' again giving boundaries, and continuing: 'The islands of Mokumoa, Mokuonini, and Mokuoco are a part of Moakalua and are included in the above area.' \n\n[194 U.S. 154, 161]\n\u00a0\n The description of what is intended to be conveyed could not be plainer. But the habendum is 'to have and to hold the above granted land,' and it is said that, as the fishery of an overlord or konohiki, unlike the rights of tenants, did not pass as an incident of land, but must be distinctly granted, the fishery was not included in the patent. Haalelea v. Montgomery, 2 Hawaiian Rep. 62, 71. Again, we must avoid being deceived by a form of words. We assume that a mere grant of the ahupuaa without mention of the fishery would not convey the fishery. But it does not follow that any particular words are necessary to convey it when the intent is clear. When the description of the land granted says that there is incident to it a definite right of fishery, it does not matter whether the statement is technically accurate or not; it is enough that the grant is its own dictionary and explains that it means by 'land' in the habendum, land and fishery as well. There is no possibility of mistaking the intent of the patent. If declares that intent plainly on its face. There is no technical rule which overrides the expressed intent, like that of the common law, which requires the mention of heirs in order to convey a fee. We are of opinion that the patent did what it was meant to do, and therefore that the plaintiff is entitled to prevail.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. MILLS(1904)\nNo. 235\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This case came here on a certificate of which the following is the material portion:\n'The plaintiff is a citizen of Montans, and the owner by assignment of three causes of action (for goods sold and on a promissory note) against the Obelisk Mining & Concentrating Company, a Montana corporation. The indebtedness of the company upon these causes of action accrued July 31, 1892, July 1, 1892, and December 12, 1892, respectively. The defendants are and always have been citizens and residents of Connecticut, and at all the times mentioned in the complaint were trustees of the said Obelisk Mining Company. The statutes of Montana provide that within twenty days from the 1st day of September every such company shall annually file a specified report, and if it 'shall fail to do so, all the trustees of the company shall be jointly and severally liable \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n for all of the debts of the company then existing, and for all that shall be contracted before such report shall be made.' Section 460 of chapter 25 of the 5th division, Compiled Statutes of Montana, which was in force when the cause of action arose. Re-enacted as  451 of the Civil Code of Montana, which went into effect July 1, 1895\n\n\n\n'The Obelisk Company failed to file certain of the required reports, and the causes of action sued upon here, against the defendants as trustees, to recover debts of the company, accrued September 22, 1893, or prior thereto. This action was brought to enforce the joint and several liability of the defendants under the statute on July 30, 1897.\n\n'When the cause of action accrued the Compiled Statutes of Montana contained these sections:\n\n\"Sec. 45. 1. In an action for a penalty or forfeiture, when the action is given to an individual, or to an individual and the territory, except where the statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation; 2, an action against a sheriff or other officer for the escape of a prisoner arrested or imprisoned on civil process shall be commenced within one year.'\n\n\"Sec. 50. If, when the cuase of action shall accrue against a person, he is out of the territory, the action may be commenced within the time herein limited, after his return to the territory; and if, after the cause of action shall have accrued, he depart from this territory, the time of his absence shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.'\n\n'Both of those sections were repealed by the Code of Civil Procedure ,  3482, which went into effect July 1, 1895. On the last-named date the Civil Code of Montana went into effect, containing  451, above cited. The Code of Civil Procedure contains a separate title, numbered II., and containing four chapters ( 470 to 559), which deals exhaustively with 'the time of commencing actions.' It contains these sections:\n\n\"Sec. 515. Within two years: \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n\"1. An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, 'when the action is given to an individual, or to an individual and the state, except when the sttute imposing and the state, except when the statute imposing\n\n\n\"Sec. 541. If, when the cause of action accrues against a person, he is out of the state, the action may be commenced within the term herein limited, after his return to the state, and if, after the cause of action accrues, he departs from the state, the time of his absence is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.'\n\n\"Sec. 554. This title does not affect actions against directors or stockholders of a corporation, to recover a penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce a liability created by law; but such actions must be brought within three years after the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which the penalty of forfeiture attached or the liability created ( sic).'\n\n'Upon the facts above set forth, the question of law concerning which this court desires the instruction of the Supreme Court, for its proper decision, is:\n\n\"May a defendant, in an action of the kind specified in  554 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Montana, avail of the limitation therein prescribed, when the action is brought against him in the court of another state?\"\n\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The general theory on which an action is maintained upon a cause which accrued in another jurisdiction is that the liability is an obligatio, which, having been attached to the person by the law then having that person within its power, will be \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n treated by other countries as accompanying the person when brought before their courts. But, as the source of the obligation is the foreign law, the defendant, generally speaking, is entitled to the benefit of whatever conditions and limitations the foreign law creates. Slater v. Mexican Nat. R. Co. \n194 U.S. 120\n, ante, p. 581, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. It is true that this general proposition is qualified by the fact that the ordinary limitations of actions are treated as laws of procedure, and as belonging to the lex fori, as affecting the remedy only, and not the right. But in cases where it has been possible to escape from that qualification by a reasonable distinction, courts have been willing to treat limitations of time as standing like other limitations, and cutting down the defendant's liability wherever he is sued. The common case is where a statute creates a new liability, and in the same section or in the same act limits the time within which it can be enforced, whether using words of condition or not. The Harrisburg, \n119 U.S. 199\n, 30 L. ed. 358.1 But the fact that the limitation is contained in the same section or the same statute is material only as bearing on construction. It is merely a ground for saying that the limitation goes to the right created, and accompanies the obligation everywhere. The same conclusion would be reached if the limitation was in a different statute, provided it was directed to the newly created liability so specifically as to warrant saying that it qualified the right.\n If, then, the only question were one of construction and as to liabilities subsequently incurred, it would be a comparatively easy matter to say that  554 of the Montana Code of Civil Procedure qualifies the liability imposed upon directors by  451 of the Civil Code, and creates a condition to the corresponding right of action against them, which goes with it into any jurisdiction where the action may be brought. But the question certified raises greater difficulties both as to construction and as to power. We have first to consider whether  554 purports to qualify, or to impose a condition upon, liabilities already incurred under the earlier act taken up into  451. In doing so we assume that the \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n word 'directors' in the later act means the same as 'trustees' in the earlier one. The contrary was not suggested. At the argument we were pressed with  3455 of the Code of Civil Procedure: 'No action or proceeding commenced before this Code takes effect, and no right accrued, is affected by its provisions.' But the trouble made by this is more seeming than real. The following section deals specifically with limitations, and must be taken to override a merely general precaution against the disturbance of vested rights.\n By  3456: 'When a limitation or period of time prescribed in any existing statute for acquiring a right or barring a remedy, or for any other purpose, has begun to run before this Code goes into effect, and the same or any limitation is prescribed in this Code, the time which has already run shall be deemed part of the time prescribed as such limitation by this Code.' The language clearly imports that the limitations in the Code are to apply to existing obligations upon which the previous limitation already had begun to run. The result is that  554 purports to substitute a three years' limitation for the one year previously in force, assuming that the previous one year limitation applied to this case, as, under the decisions, it did. State Sav. Bank v. Johnson, 18 Mont. 440, 33 L. R. A. 552, 56 Am. St. Rep. 591, 45 Pac. 662; National Park Bank v. Remsen, \n158 \nU.S. 337, 342\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1008, 1009, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. But if  554 purported to make this substitution, it purported to introduce important changes. It lengthened the time on the one hand, but it took away the exception in case of absence from the state on the other. This last is disputed, but it seems to us a part of the meaning of the words 'This title does not affect actions against directors,' etc. The section as to absence from the state is a part of the title, and whatever necessary exceptions may be made from the generality of the words quoted, this is not one of them.\n A further difference is that, while there might be difficulties in construing the general limitation upon actions for penalties as going to the right, this section is so specific that it hardly can mean anything else. We express no opinion as to the earlier act, but we think that this  554 so definitely deals \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n with the liability sought to be enforced that, upon the principles heretofore established, it must be taken to effect its substance so far as it can, although passed at a different time from the statute by which that liability first was created. We do not go beyone the case before us. Different considerations might apply to the ordinary statutes as to stockholders. We express no opinion with regard to that.\n We come, then, to the question of power. It is said that a statute of limitations cannot take away an existing right, but only remedies, and therefore that, whatever the effect of  554 on subsequently accruing liabilities, it cannot bar the plaintiff in this suit. Before considering this it is to be observed in the first place that, so far as the state of Montana was concerned, the only practical difference made by the statute was to take away the allowance for absence from the state, while giving over a year for the prosecution of the action within it. The cause of action accrued on September 22, 1893, and the new statute went into effect on July 1, 1895, so that the plaintiffs had at least until September 22, 1896, in which to sue there. As to action within the state, it could not be contended that the change took away constitutional rights. It did not shorten liability unreasonably. Wheeler v. Jackson, \n137 U.S. 245\n, 34 L. ed. 659, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76. The only way in which it could be made out that the attempt to take away a remedy outside the state after the same lapse of time was unconstitutional is through the theoretical proposition which we have state. It is said that remedies outside the state can be affected only by destroying the right, and that no statute of limitations can do that.\n It is quite incredible that such an unsubstantial distinction should find a place in constitutional law. Prescription which applies to easement the analogy of the statute of limitations unquestionably vests a title. There is no such thing as a merely possessory easement. A disseisor of a dominant estate may get an easement which already is attached to it, but the easement is attached to the land by title, or not at all. Again, as to land the distinction amounts to nothing, because to deny \n\n[194 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n all remedy, direct or indirect, within the state, is practically to deny the right. 'The lapse of time limited by such statutes not only bars the remedy, but it extinguishes the right, and vests a perfect title in the adverse holder.' Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599, 605, 17 L. ed. 261, 263. So far as we have observed, the cases which have had occasion to deal with the matter generally hold that the title to chattels, even, passes where the statute has run. Campbell v. Holt, \n115 \nU.S. 620, 623\n, 29 S. L. ed. 483, 485, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209; Chapin v. Freeland, 142 Mass. 383, 386.2 Property is protected because such protection answers a demand of human nature, and therefore takes the place of a fight. But that demand is not founded more certainly by creation or discovery than it is by the lapse of time, which gradually shapes the mind to expect and demand the continuance of what it actually and long has enjoyed, even if without right, and dissociates it from a like demand of even a right which long has been denied. Dunbar v. Boston & P. R. Corp. 181 Mass. 383, 385, 63 N. E. 916. Constitutions are intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories. It is pretty safe to assume that when the law may deprive a man of all the benefits of what once was his, it may deprive him of technical title as well. That it may do so is shown sufficiently by the cases which we have cited and many others.\n In the case at bar the question comes up in the most attenuated form. The law is dealing not with tangible property, but with a cause of action of its own creation. The essential feature of that cause of action is that it is one in the jurisdiction which created it; that it is one elsewhere is a more or less accidental incident. If the laws of Montana can set the limitation to the domestic suit, it is the least possible stretch to say that they may set it also to a foreign action, even if to that extent an existing obstacle in the way, and we are of opinion that they have purported to do it and have done it.\n The question is answered in the affirmative, and it will be so certified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 Sup.

Hutchings and John J.

By the 25th section of the act it is provided:\n'That before any allotment shall be made of lands in the Cherokee Nation, there shall be segregated therefrom by the commission heretofore mentioned, in separate allotments or otherwise, the one hundred and fifty- seven thousand, six hundred acres purchased by the Delaware tribe of Indians from the Cherokee Nation, under agreement of April eigth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, subject to the judicial determination of the rights of said descendants and the Cherokee Nation under said agreement. That the Delaware Indians residing in the Cherokee Nation are hereby authorized and empowered to \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n bring suit in the court of claims of the United States, within sixty days after the passage of this act, against the Cherokee Nation, for the purpose of determining the rights of said Delaware Indians in and to the lands and funds of said nation under their contract and agreement with the Cherokee Nation dated April eighth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven; or the Cherokee Nation may bring a like suit against said Delaware Indians; and jurisdiction is conferred on said court to adjudicate and fully determine the same, with right of appeal to either party to the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n\n Under this section the present suit was prosecuted in the court of claims by the Delaware Indians residing in the Cherokee Nation, as a tribe and individually, joined by certain others suing for the surviving registered Delawares, their children, descendants, and personal representatives, against the Cherokee Nation, for the purpose of determining the right of the Delaware Indians 'in and to the lands and funds of said nation' under the contract and agreement with the Cherokee Nation dated April 8, 1867. This contract sets forth:\n'Now, therefore, it is agreed between the parties hereto, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, as follows:\n\n'The Cherokees, parties of the first part, for and in consideration of certain payments and the fulfilment of certain conditions hereinafter mentioned, agree to sell to the Delawares for their occupancy, a quantity of land east of the line of the 96 west longitude, in the aggregate equal to 160 acres for each individual of the Delaware tribe who has been enrolled upon a certain register made February 18, 1867, by the Delaware agent, and on file in the Office of Indian Affairs, being the list of Delawares who elect to remove to the 'Indian country,' to which list may be added, only with the consent of the Delaware council, the names of such other Delawares as may, within one month after signing of this agreement, desire to be added thereto, and the selections of the lands to be purchased by the Delawares may be made by said Delawares in \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n any part of the Cherokee reservation east of said line 96 not already selected and in possession of other parties, and in case the Cherokee lands shall hereafter be allotted among the members of said nation, it is agreed that the aggregate amount of land herein provided for the Delawares to include their improvements according to the legal subdivisions when surveys are made (that is to say, 160 acres for each individual), shall be guaranteed to each Delaware incorporated by these articles into the Cherokee Nation, nor shall the continued ownership and occupancy of said land by any Delaware so registered be interfered with in any manner whatever without his consent but shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as are, by the laws of the Cherokee Nation, imposed upon native citizens thereof.\n\n'Provided that nothing herein shall confer the right to alienate, convey, or dispose of any such lands except in accordance with the constitution and laws of said Cherokee Nation.\n\n'And the said Delawares, parties of the second part, agree that there shall be paid to the said Cherokees from the Delaware funds now held or hereafter received by the United States, a sum of money equal to $1 per acre for the whole amount of 160 acres of land for every individual Delaware who has already been registered upon the aforesaid list, made February 18, 1867, with the additions thereto heretofore provided for.\n\n'And the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and requested to sell any United States stocks belonging to the Delawares to procure funds necessary to pay for said lands; but in case he shall not feel authorized, under existing treaties, to sell such bonds belonging to the Delawares, it is agreed that he may transfer such United States bonds to the Cherokee Nation, at their market value at the date of such transfer.\n\n'And the said Delawares further agree that there shall be paid from their funds now or hereafter to come into possession of the United States a sum of money which shall sustain the same proportion to the existing Cherokee national fund that \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n the number of Delawares registered as above mentioned and removing to the Indian country sustains to the whole number of Cherokees residing in the Cherokee Nation. And for the purpose of ascertaining such relative numbers the registers of the Delawares herein referred to, with such additions as may be made within one month from the signing of this agreement, shall be the basis of calculation as to the Delawares, and an accurate census of the Cherokees residing in the Cherokee Nation shall be taken under the laws of that nation within four months, and properly certified copies thereof filed in the Office of Indian Affairs, which shall be the basis of calculation as to the Cherokees.\n\n'And that there may be no doubt hereafter as to the amount to be contributed to the Cherokee national fund by the Delawares, it is hereby agreed by the parties hereto that the whole amount of the invested funds of the Cherokees, after deducting all just claims thereon, is $678,000.\n\n'And the Delawares further agree that in calculating the total amount of said national fund there shall be added to the said sum of $678,000 the sum of $1,000,000, being the estimated value of the Cherokee neutral lands in Kansas, thus making the whole Cherokee national fund $1,678,000; and this last mentioned sum shall be taken as the basis for calculating the amount which the Delawares are to pay into the common fund.\n\n'Provided, that as the $678,000 of funds now on hand belonging to the Cherokees is chiefly composed of stocks of different values, the Secretary of the Interior may transfer from the Delawares to the Cherokees a proper proportion of the stocks now owned by the Delawares of like grade and value, which transfer shall be in part of the pro rata contribution herein provided for by the Delawares to the funds of the Cherokee Nation; but the balance of the pro rata contribution by the Delawares to said fund shall be in cash or United States bonds, at their market value.\n\n'All cash, and all proceeds of stocks, whenever the same may fall due or be sold, received by the Cherokees from the \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n Delawares under the agreement, shall be invested and applied in accordance with the 23d article of the treaty with the Cherokees of August 11, 1866\n\n\n\n'On the fulfilment by the Delawares of the foregoing stipulations, all the members of the tribe registered as above provided shall become members of the Cherokee Nation, with the same rights and immunities, and the same participation (and no other) in the national funds, as native Cherokees, save as hereinbefore provided.\n\n'And the children hereinafter born of such Delawares so incorporated into the Cherokee Nation shall, in all respects, be regarded as native Cherokees.'\n\n The treaties which led up to this agreement are referred to in the contract and were ratified in 1866. The 15th article of the treaty of August 11, 1866, between the United States and the Cherokee Nation provided:\n'Article XV. The United States may settle any civilized Indians, friendly with the Cherokees and adjacent tribes, within the Cherokee country, on unoccupied lands east of 96 degrees, on such terms as may be agreed upon by any such tribe and the Cherokees, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, which shall be consistent with the following provisions, viz.: Should any such tribe or band of Indians settling in said country abandon their tribal organization, there being first paid into the Cherokee national fund a sum of money which shall sustain the same proportion to the then existing national fund that the number of Indians sustain to the whole number of Cherokees then residing in the Cherokee country, they shall be incorporated into, and ever after remain, a part of the Cherokee Nation, on equal terms in every respect with native citizens. And should any such tribe, thus settling in said country, decide to preserve their tribunal organizations, and to maintain their tribal laws, customs, and usages, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation, they shall have a district of country set off for their use by metes and bounds equal to one hundred and sixty acres, \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 133]\n\u00a0\n if they should so decide, for each man, woman, and child of said tribe, and shall pay for the same into the national fund such price as may be agreed on by them and the Cherokee Nation, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, and, in cases of disagreement, the price to be fixed by the President.\n\n'An the said tribe thus settled shall also pay into the national fund a sum of money, to be agreed on by the respective parties, not greater in proportion to the whole existing national fund and the probable proceeds of the lands herein ceded or authorized to be ceded or sold than their numbers bear to the whole number of Cherokees then residing in said country, and thence afterwards they shall enjoy all the rights of native Cherokees. But no Indians who have no tribal organizations, or who shall determine to abandon their tribal organization, shall be permitted to settle east of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude without the consent of the Cherokee national council, or of a delegation duly appointed by it, being first obtained. And no Indians who have and determine to preserve their tribal organizations shall be permitted to settle, as herein provided, east of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude without such consent being first obtained, unless the President of the United States, after a full hearing of the objections offered by said council or delegation to such settlement, shall determine that the objections are insufficient, in which case he may authorize the settlement of such tribe east of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude.' [14 Stat. at L. 803.]\n\n Article IV. of the Delaware treaty, referred to in the agreement of April 8, 1867, is in the following terms:\n'Article IV. The United States agree to sell to the said Delaware Indians a tract of land ceded to the government by the Choctaws and Chickasaws, the Creeks, or the Seminoles, or which may be ceded by the Cherokees in the Indian country, to be selected by the Delawares in one body in as compact a form as practicable, so as to contain timber, water, and agricultural lands, to contain in the aggregate, if the said Delaware \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n Indians shall so desire, a quantity equal to one hundred and sixty (160) acres for each man, woman, and child who shall remove to said country, at the price per acre paid by the United States for the said lands, to be paid for by the Delawares out of the proceeds of sales of land in Kansas, heretofore provided for. The said tract of country shall be set off with clearly and permanently marked boundaries by the United States; and also surveyed as public lands are surveyed, when the Delaware council shall so request; when the same may, in whole or in part, be allotted by said council to each member of said tribe residing in said country, said allotment being subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.' [ 14 Stat. at L. 794.]\n\n At the time of moving upon these lands there were 985 registered Delawares, of whom 212 survived at the beginning of this suit, together with children and descendants of those deceased.\n The agreement of April 8, 1867, was before this court in the case of the Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake, \n155 U.S. 196\n, 39 L. ed. 120, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 55. While the precise questions involved in the present controversy were not then before the court, the rights adjudicated turned upon the construction of the agreement of April 8, 1867, and its nature and the history of the events which led up to its execution by the parties thereto were the subjects of consideration and determination by this court. In that case it was held that under the agreement the registered Delawares were incorporated into the Cherokee Nation, and as members and citizens thereof were entitled to participate in the proceeds of the sale of a portion of the Cherokee lands lupon equalterms with native Cherokee citizens. The claim is made that the contract of 1867 secured to the registered Delawares individually, or to the Delawares as a tribe, the 157, 000 acres of land which were to be set off to them east of the ninety- sixth meridian. This agreement was made and entered into in pursuance of the treaty stipulations hereinbefore referred to. And while it may be regarded as arising from these preliminary treaties with the United States, the care with which it was \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n made and the evident intention of the parties to deal at arm's length with full knowledge of their respective rights and aims, leaves little to be gained from these preliminary treaties as an aid to construction, except as a means of placing ourselves in the situation of the parties when the contract was signed and delivered. It is the claim in behalf of the Delawares that if not technically an estate in fee, one was conveyed permanent in its character and transmissible by descent to the children and kin of the registered Delawares, or at least it was a holding which should endure so long as the Delawares and their descendants continued to exist as a tribe.\n It was held in the Journeycake Case, to be the purpose of this agreement to incorporate the registered Delawares into the Cherokee Nation, with full participation in the political and property rights of citizens of that nation. As a part of the general agreement, provision is made for rights in certain lands as a home for the Delawares who are to remove from their Kansas lands to the Indian territory. These lands are to pass to registered Delawares and they are to have the privilege of selecting them from unoccupied lands east of the line 96 degrees west longitude. This right is conferred not upon the Delaware Nation, but upon certain registered Delawares who are to be incorporated into the Cherokee Nation. To such is given a quantity of land equal in the aggregate to 160 acres for each registered Delaware, whose name is required to be entered upon a register to be filed in the Office of Indian Affairs, the lands thus conveyed being distinctly declared to be sold to the Delawares 'for their occupancy.' This limitation, in what may be characterized as the habendum clause of the conveyance, does not import a holding beyond the life of the first taker, and is entirely inconsistent with the idea of permanency of tenure in the estate conveyed unless there is something in the nature of Indian titles to lands or in the terms of the instrument which requires an enlargement of an estate for occupancy into one the equivalent of a fee. It is argued that an estate of occupancy is the ordinary estate of the Indian tribes and \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n embraces all the title held by them, the fee remaining in the United States. There in nothing to prevent the United States, if it chooses to convey a fee to the Indian tribes, from so doing.\n Indeed, in the 16th clause of the treaty with the Cherokee Nation of Auguest, 1866, it is provided that a fee may be conveyed to friendly Indians settled west of the ninety-sixth meridian. But for the present purpose, it is unnecessary to speculate as to the nature of the Indian title derived from the United States by treaty. The nature and extent of the Cherokee title has been settled by previous adjudications of this court. In the case of Cherokee Trust Funds, \n117 \nU.S. 288, 308\n, 29 S. L. ed. 880, 886, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718, 727, it was held that the lands of the Cherokee Nation belonged to them as a political body, and not to its individual members, and, speaking of the rights of individual Cherokees, it was said: 'He had a right to use parcels of the lands thus held by the nation, subject to such rules as its governing authority might prescribe.'\n The lands of the Cherokee Nation are not held in individual ownership, but are public lands, though held for the equal benefit of all the members. Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 U.S. 445\n-488, 43 L. ed. 1041-1056, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722; Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 295\n, 47 L. ed. 184, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. Under the patent issued to the Cherokees for their lands, whatever title conveyed was to the Cherokees as a nation, and no title was vested in severalty in any of the Cherokees. Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake, \n155 U.S. 196\n-207, 39 L. ed. 120-124, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 55.\n In an agreement incorporating certain Delawares into the Cherokee Nation it is important to consider under what terms and conditions its citizens held and used the lands occupied by them. We are here dealing with the extent of the title conveyed as between Indian tribes, and the question is, What did the Cherokees convey in the agreement to the Delawares who came within the terms of the compact and who were to be incorporated into the Cherokee Nation? In addition to the limitations expressed in the conveyance, 'for occupancy,' we find other terms of the instrument inconsistent with the grant of a perpetual estate. It is provided that in case the Cherokee \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 137]\n\u00a0\n lands shall hereafter be allotted among the members of said nation, the aggregate amount of land provided for the Delawares, to include their improvements according to the legal subdivisions when surveys are made ( that is to say, 160 acres for each individual), shall be guaranteed to each Delaware incorporated by the articles into the Cherokee Nation. The lands which are for occupancy of the Delawares are described as 'Cherokee lands,' and a provision made which secures 160 acres, to include their improvements, to each registered Delaware in case of allotment. It the full title was intended to be transferred to the Delawares, either as a tribe or individually, this stipulation to secure the rights of the Delawares in the contingency named was entirely superfluous. Further, the contract reads: 'Nor shall the ownership and occupancy of said lands by any Delawares so registered be interfered with in any manner whatsoever without his consent, but shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as are, by the laws of the Cherokee Nation, imposed upon the native citizens thereof. Provided, that nothing herein shall confer the right to alienate, convey, or dispose of any such land except in accordance with the constitution and laws of said Cherokee Nation.'\n These stipulations wholly inconsistent with the full title of the Delawares to the lands in question, must be read in the light of the Constitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation as to the holding of land by Cherokee citizens.\n The provisions of the Cherokee constitution and the statutes passed in pursuance thereof pertinent to the subject are collected in the opinion of the court of claims in the Journeycake Case, and are cited in a note to the opinion of this court in the same case. \n155 U.S. 207\n, 39 L. ed. 124, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 55. From them it is apparent that lands to be held upon the same terms as the Cherokees hold their lands cannot be alienated by those who occupy and hold them, but the ownership is lodged in the Cherokee Nation. The individual has no right to alienate or lease the lands. The nation grants and restricts the right of occupancy. The title \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 138]\n\u00a0\n to the lands is vested in the government, to be held and controlled in such wise as to promote the general welfare. Under these restrictions and conditions the registered Delawares held the lands set apart for their occupancy. In the laws of the Cherokee Nation we find that the use of the terms 'for use and occupancy' was not an unfamiliar form of expression in describing the character and limitation upon the right of private ownership. Thus, in the act relating to the public domain, and reserving tracts of lands 1 mile square along railroads at stations, and providing for the sale of town lots, it is provided that the purchaser shall acquire no other rights than those of use and occupancy. If the lands in question were granted in perpetuity to the Delawares, we have the awarding of an estate of this character carved out of lands recognized in the agreement as continuing to be Cherokee lands, belonging to the nation which expressly limits the conveyance of its lands to its own citizens for use and occupancy only. Again, if it was intended to provide for the children or heirs of the first takers-the registered Delawares-we should expect to find some words in the agreement competent for that purpose, conceding that the technical terms of the common law to create an estate in fee need not have been used. As to the children of the registered Delawares, we find this specific provision: 'And the children hereafter born of such Delawares so incorporated into the Cherokee Nation shall, in all respects, be regarded as native Cherokees.' This provision is utterly inconsistent with the grant of an estate in the lands to survive the 'occupancy' of the registered Delawares. Such children are to have the rights of native Cherokees, and no more. Their parents were incorporated into the Cherokee Nation with certain specific rights; the children were to stand upon an equality with their adopted brethren of the Cherokee blood.\n The importance of the issue now distinctly made as to the title to these lands has led us to give renewed examination to the question of the extent and character of the interest conveyed to the Delawares in the lands in controversy. In the \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 139]\n\u00a0\n Journeycake Case, while it is true that the precise question was not the same as is now presented, full consideration to all the terms of this contract was given in order to determine the interests of the Delawares in the Cherokee lands sold, and the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, used this pertinent language, the force of which has not been diminished in the light of subsequent examinations aided by the arguments and briefs of counsel now presented: 'So far as the provision in the agreement for the purchase of homes is concerned, it will be perceived that no absolute title to these homes was granted. We may take notice of the fact that the Cherokees, in their long occupation of this reservation, had generally secured homes for themselves; that the laws of the Cherokee Nation provided for the appropriation by the several Cherokees of lands for personal occupation, and that this purchase by the Delawares was with the view of securing to the individual Delawares the like homes; that the lands thus purchased and paid for still remained a part of the Cherokee reservation. And as a further consideration for the payment of this sum for the purchase of homes the Delawares were guaranteed not merely the continued occupancy thereof, but also that in case of a subsequent allotment in severalty of the entire body of lands among the members of the Cherokee Nation, they should receive an aggregate amount equal to that which they had purchased, and such a distribution as would secure to them the homes upon which they had settled, together with their improvements. So that if, when the allotment was made, there was, for any reason, not land enough to secure to each member of the Cherokee Nation 160 acres, the Delawares were to have at least that amount, and the deficiency would have to be borne by the native Cherokees pro rata. In other words, there was no purchase of a distinct body of lands, as in the case of the settlement of other tribes as tribes within the limits of the Cherokee reservation. The individual Delawares took their homes in, and remaining in, the Cherokee reservation, and as lands to be considered in any subsequent allotment in severalty among the members of \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 140]\n\u00a0\n the Cherokee Nation. All this was in the line of the expressed thought of a consolidation of these Delawares with, and the absorption of them into, the Cherokee Nation as individual members thereof. If it be said that all of the Delaware trust funds were not turned into the national fund it will be remembered that there was no impropriety in the reservation of a part thereof in order to enable the Delawares to make such improvements as they might desire on the tracts that they selected for homes, and also that there was no certainty that all the members of the Delaware tribe would elect to remove to the Cherokee country, and that those who remained in Kansas were entitled to their share in the Delaware national funds.'\n If such be the true construction of the agreement, it is nevertheless insisted that it should not be literally enforced in view of the understanding of the parties, more particularly of the Delawares, that they were thereby receiving full title to the occupied lands. To establish this contention it is claimed that in view of the character of the contracting parties they should not be held to the strict rule of evidence which denies the competency of parol testimony to contradict written agreements, and a class of cases is cited of which Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L. ed. 483, may be taken as an example. The language of Justice McLean is quoted, in which he said:\n'The language used in treaties with the Indians should never be construed to their prejudice. If words be made use of which are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import, as connected with the tenor of the treaty, they should be considered as used only in the latter sense. . . . How the words of the treaty were understood by this unlettered people, rather than their critical meaning, should form the rule of construction.'\n\n But the Justice was here dealing with a treaty negotiated between the representatives of the United States and those of the Indians, wherein the disparity of the contracting parties in education and knowledge of law and the use of language is obvious. \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 141]\n\u00a0\n The contract of April 7, 1867, was negotiated between representatives of Indian nations, meeting upon equal terms. In the testimony of John G. Pratt, called for the Delawares, and at one time Indian agent for the Delaware agency, it appears:\n Q. Do you know whether or not the agreement frequently referred to in your testimony was read over to the two delegations representing the Delawares and Cherokee tribes of Indians?\n A. It was read over repeatedly; read over and corrected and altered and read over again several times, and each party put in his suggestions, until they finally harmonized.\n Q. Then, as I understand, the agreement, as finally signed, expressed the wishes of both sides, and both sides were fully satisfied with all it contained?\n A. No; the Delawares were not satisfied, but they signed because it was the best they could do. They wanted to own the land outright.\n Q. They did not contend at any time afterwards that the agreement did not fully express what they intended to express, did they?\n A. No, sir; I did not hear anything of that kind.\n We can perceive no room in this case for a departure from the familiar rules of the law protecting written agreements from the uncertainties of parol testimony. The testimony offered was, in the main, that of interested persons nearly thirty years after the agreement had been reduced to writing and signed by the parties thereto. Nor can we find a latent ambiguity in the terms of the contract which requires the admission of parol testimony to explain its effect. In the light of the circumstances and the language used in the writing, its construction is not rendered difficult because of latent ambiguities. It is claimed as a cogent circumstance, which should be considered in construing this agreement, that the Cherokee Nation received $1 per acre for these lands,- a sum sufficient to cover their full value, and of consequent importance in determining the character of the estate conveyed. \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 142]\n\u00a0\n In the Journeycake Case it was held that, in consideration of the sum paid for citizenship rights, the Delawares obtained an interest in the lands of the Cherokee Nation, although the same were not considered in making up the sum paid for what has been denominated the right of citizenship. In that case it is pointed out that at the time the agreement under consideration was made the Cherokee Nation possessed, in addition to the 'neutral' lands in Kansas, which were estimated at $1,000,000 in making up the total of the Cherokee national fund of $1,678,000 upon the basis of which the Delawares paid into the common fund-\n\"Strip\" lands in Kansas (about) 400,000 acres. Lands west of 96 degrees, Indian territory (about) 8,000,000 acres. Lands east of 96 degrees, Indian territory home reservation (about) 5,000,000 acres.\n\n In that case it was held that the Delawares acquired a right in the distribution of the proceeds, not only of the Kansas lands, but as well in such sales as were made of this vast domain held by the Cherokee Nation. Of this feature of the agreement Mr. Justice Brewer, in the Journeycake Case, says: 'Neither should too much weight be given to the fact that the Delawares were to pay for their homes at the rate of $1 an acre, for by that purchase they acquired no title in fee simple, and it is not unreasonable to believe that the price thus fixed was not merely as compensation for the value of the lands (to be taken in the eastern portion of the reservation, where the body of the Cherokees had their homes, and therefore probably the most valuable portion of the entire reservation), but also as sufficient compensation for an interest in the entire body of lands, that interest being, like that of the native Cherokees, limited to a mere occupancy of the tracts set apart for homes, with the right to free use in common of the unoccupied portion of the reserve, and the right to share in any future allotment.' \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 143]\n\u00a0\n We conclude, then, that the registered Delawares acquired in these lands only the right of occupancy during life, with a right, upon allotment of the lands, to not less than 160 acres, together with their improvements, and the children and descendants of such Delawares took only the rights of other citizens of the Cherokee Nation, as the same are regulated by its laws.\n The bill further seeks to exclude from the allotment of Cherokee lands and funds certain citizens alleged to have been illegally admitted to citizenship, thereby wrongfully diminishing the shares of the Delawares in the common property. At the time of the agreement of April 7, 1867, the constitution,  2 and 5, of the Cherokee Nation had been amended to read:\n'Sec. 2. The lands of the Cherokee Nation shall remain common property until the national council shall request the survey and allotment of the same, in accordance with the provisions of article 20th of the treaty of 19th July, 1866, between the United States and the Cherokee Nation.\n\n'See. 5. No person shall be eligible to a seat in the national council but a male citizen of the Cherokee Nation who shall have attained to the age of twenty-five years, and who shall have been a bona fide resident of the district in which he may be elected at least six months immediately preceding such election. All native-born Cherokees, all Indians, and whites legally members of the nation by adoption, and all freedmen who have been liberated by voluntary act of their former owners or by law, as well as freed colored persons who were in the country at the commencement of the Rebellion, and are now residents therein, or who may return within six months from the 19th day of July, 1866, and their descendants who reside within the limits of the Cherokee Nation, shall be taken and deemed to be citizens of the Cherokee Nation.'\n\n These constitutional provisions were in full force when the Delawares acquired their rights and when they were incorporated, or, as the agreement expressed it, 'consolidated,' with \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 144]\n\u00a0\n the Cherokee Nation. Under its terms the Delawares have participated in political rights and have taken part in the government of the nation. It is claimed that these amendments were illegally adopted for want of compliance with authorized methods for amending the national constitution. But the nation has never undertaken to set them aside or call in question their force and effect. They were in the fundamental law when the Delawares were made a part of the Cherokee Nation and the rights exercised were only those belonging to the nation when the Delawares saw fit to subject themselves to the laws of a new nation of which they were to become a component part upon equal terms with other citizens. The Cherokee Nation has many of the rights and privileges of an independent people. They have their own constitution and laws and power to administer their internal affairs. They are recognized as a distinct political community and treaties have been made with them in that character. Cherokee Trust Funds, \n117 U.S. 288\n, 29 L. ed. 880, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718. It is not reasonable to suppose that in the act under which these proceedings were brought it was intended to authorize inquiry into the administration of the political affairs of the Cherokee Nation, with a view to setting aside and the revision of political action in admitting and the revision of plitical action in admitting persons to citizenship in the nation under authority of its constitution. The same conclusion disposes of the contention of the appellants that relief can be granted in this case in respect to alleged maladministration of the financial affairs of the Cherokee Nation, with a view to holding it to account in favor of the Delawares prosecuting this suit. We are authorized by the enabling act to determine the contractual rights of the Delawares in the national lands and funds; not to overhaul the political and administrative action of the Cherokee Nation.\n The act authorizing this suit contemplates a determination of the rights and interest of the Delawares residing in the Cherokee Nation in the lands and funds of the Cherokee Nation under the compact of April, 1867. That it was the purpose \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 145]\n\u00a0\n of Congress to have a full and final determination of such rights is further shown in the Cherokee allotment act of July 1, 1902. Section 23 of this act provides:\n'Sec. 23. All Delaware Indians who are members of the Cherokee Nation shall take lands and share in the funds of the tribe, as their rights may be determined by the judgment of the court of claims, or by the Supreme Court if appealed, in the suit instituted therein by the Delawares against the Cherokee Nation, and now pending; but if said suit be not determined before said commission is ready to begin the allotment of lands of the tribe as herein provided, the commission shall cause to be segregated one hundred and fifty-seven thousand, six hundred acres of land, including lands which have been selected and occupied by Delawares in conformity to the provisions of their agreement with the Cherokees dated April eighth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, such lands so to remain, subject to disposition according to such judgment as may be rendered in said cause; and said commission shall thereupon proceed to the allotment of the remaining lands of the tribe as aforesaid. Said commission shall, when final judgment is rendered, allot lands to such Delawares in conformity to the terms of the judgment and their individual rights thereunder. Nothing in this act shall in any manner impair the rights of either party to said contract as the same may be finally determined by the court, or shall interfere with the holdings of the Delawares under their contract with the Cherokees of April eighth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, until their rights under said contract are determined by the courts in their suit now pending against the Cherokees, and said suit shall be advanced on the dockets of said courts, and determined at the earliest time practicable.' [ 32 Stat. at L. 718, chap. 1375.]\n\n These acts contemplate a judgment of the court which shall determine the rights of the Delawares and Cherokees in the lands and funds of the Cherokee Nation in such wise as to enable a division to be made conformable to the rights of the parties as judicially determined. The court of claims rendered \n\n[193 U.S. 127, 146]\n\u00a0\n a decree dismissing the bill. Whilst agreeing with the conclusions reached in that court as to the rights of the Delawares. we think the bill was broad enough in its allegations and prayer for relief to require a definite settlement of the rights in controversy. Instead of dismissing the bill, we think a decree should have been entered finding the registered Delawares entitled to participate equally with Cherokee citizens of Cherokee blood in the allotment of lands of the Cherokee Nation, with the addition that if there is not enough land to give to each citizen of the nation 160 acres, then the registered Delawares shall be given that quantity, together with their improvements. In all other respects the Cherokee citizens, whether of Delaware or Cherokee blood, should be given equal rights in the lands and funds of the Cherokee Nation. The decree dismissing the bill is so modified as to conform to the terms just stated; and as so modified it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIMMICK v. TOMPKINS(1904)\nNo. 528\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n Dimmick, the appellant, presented his petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the circuit court of the United States, northern district of California. The petition was denied, and an appeal taken to this court from the order denying the application. The appellant alleged in his petition for the writ that he was unlawfully imprisoned in the state prison of the state of California; that the imprisonment was illegal and in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, article five of the amendments to the same; that on October 16, 1901, he was sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison on by the district court of the United States in and for the northern district of California for the period of two years, to date from the 16th day of October, 1901; that he had been imprisoned, under the judgment, in the state prison ever since April 13, 1903, and that prior thereto, and from the date of the judgment to April 13, 1903, he was imprisoned, under said judgment, in the county jail of the county of Alameda, by the order of the district court.\n The appellant also alleged that, notwithstanding the foregoing facts, the warden refused to discharge or release him from imprisonment, although the term of said imprisonment expired, according to its terms, on October 16, 1903. The appellant then set forth in the petition a copy of the record of the proceedings of the district court of the United States, which showed that he was convicted in the district court on the 16th of October, 1901, of making and presenting a false claim, as charged in the first count of the indictment, and of using a portion of the public moneys of the United States for \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n a purpose not prescribed by law, as charged in the fourth count; and that he was sentenced 'to be imprisoned at hard labor for the term of two years from October 16, 1901; and it is further ordered that said sentence of imprisonment be executed upon the said Walter N. Dimmick by imprisonment in the state prison of the state of California, at San Quentin, Marin county, California.'\n The record was signed by the district judge who held the court.\n The petition also set forth a copy of the indictment under which the trial was had. It was founded upon  5438 and 5497 of the United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3674, 3707), and charged, in substance, the presentation to the cashier of the mint at San Francisco of a certain false, fictitious, and fraudulent claim against the United States, and known to be fraudulent by the defendant at the time he presented it; also, with having unlawfully used a portion of the public moneys for a purpose not prescribed by law. The appellant averred that neither the first nor the fourth count charged any crime or public offense against the United States, nor the violation of any law of the United States, and that both counts were fatally defective. The appellant also averred that the judgment of the court, in as far as it required his imprisonment in the state prison, was void because the United States district court sentenced him for one year, and no more, upon each of the two counts of the indictment referred to in the judgment, and did not sentence him to imprisonment for a period of more than one year upon each of said counts, and that a sentence to the state prison for a period of not more than one year violated the statutes of the United States.\nMr. George D. Collins for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 540, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The appeal directly to this court from the decision of the circuit court denying the writ of habeas corpus was proper under the averments contained in the petition, that the imprisonment of the appellant was in violation of the Federal Constitution. Craemer v. Washington, \n168 \nU.S. 124, 127\n, 42 S. L. ed. 407, 408, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1.\n The appellant contends that, as his sentence was imprisonment 'at hard labor for the term of two years from October 16, 1901,' his term of imprisonment under that sentence necessarily expired by its own limitation on October 16, 1903, even without any deduction for credits earned by good behavior.\n If the appellant had been at once transported to the state prison under the sentence imposed upon him after his conviction, it is, of course, plain that two years from the time of his sentence (if he remained there in the meantime) would be the extent of his legal detention. In fact, he was not taken \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 547]\n\u00a0\n to the state prison until April 13, 1903; but he avers that he had been previously, and from October 16, 1901, the date of the judgment, to April 13, 1903, imprisoned under said judgment in the county jail of the county of Alameda, by the order of said district court. The sentence upon the verdict of guilty is given in the record, which is made a part of the petition, and that record shows that the appellant was 'sentenced to be imprisoned at hard labor for the term of two years from October 16, 1901; and it is further ordered that said sentence of imprisonment be executed upon the said Walter N. Dimmick by imprisonment in the state prison of the state of California, at San Quentin, Marin county, California.'\n The imprisonment of the appellant in the county jail could not, therefore, have been under the judgment which prescribes imprisonment in the state prison. But such detention may have been owing to his efforts to obtain a review and reversal of the judgment, and, in the meantime, a supersedeas thereon, so as to prevent his transportation to the state prison, and in that case such detention should not be counted as any part of the time of imprisonment in the state prison. In that event his imprisonment in the state prison, under the judgment, should be counted from the time it actually commenced, notwithstanding the statement of the sentence that it should be for two years from October 16, 1901. The time of commencement was postponed by his own action, and he cannot take advantage of it, and thus shorten the term of his imprisonment at hard labor in the state prison.\n Upon this writ the question to be examined is one of jurisdiction; and in this case it is whether the warden of the prison has the legal right to continue the imprisonment under the sentence and warrant of commitment notwithstanding the expiration of two years from the time of sentence. If, as we have said, the detention in the jail was the result of his own action, and his imprisonment at hard labor in the state prison did not, for that reason, commence until April 13, 1903, then the legal term of his imprisonment in the state prison has not \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 548]\n\u00a0\n expired, and he is properly detained. As it was incumbent upon the appellant to show his continued imprisonment was illegal (there being no presumption that it was), the duty and the burden rested upon him to aver, and, if the averment were traversed, to prove, that his detention in jail had not been by reason of the fact suggested. This he has not done. There is no such averment in the petition for the writ and there is no proof of such fact to be found. Non constat, that he was not detained for the very reason already stated. This is fatal to the appellant, so far as this point is concerned.\n As might be surmised, there was ample reason for not making the allegation. It would not have been true.\n It appears from our own records that a petition for a certiorari was filed in this court by appellant February 2, 1903, asking for a review of the above-mentioned judgment, and in that petition it is stated that the appellant had teken proceedings to have the judgment reviewed by the circuit court of appeals, and had obtained a supersedeas thereon, and after the judgment had been affirmed by that court, and on January 13, 1903, the district court ordered the execution of the judgment thus affirmed to be stayed for the period of thirty days from that date to enable the appellant to make application to this court for a writ of certiorari, which application was made, and denied by this court March 2, 1903. \n189 U.S. 509\n, 47 L. ed. 923, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 850. In a case like this the court has the right to examine its own records and take judicial notice thereof in regard to proceedings formerly had therein by one of the parties to the proceedings now before it. The principle permitting it is announced in the following cases: Butler v. Eaton, \n141 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 35 S. L. ed. 713, 714, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 985; Craemer v. Washington, \n168 \nU.S. 124, 129\n, 42 S. L. ed. 407, 409, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1; Bienville Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1132, 1135, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 820.\n That the party seeking to review a judgment of imprisonment in a state prison cannot take advantage of his own action in so doing as to thereby shorten the term of imprisonment in the state prison is, as we think, plain. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the general principle that a person \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 549]\n\u00a0\n shall not be permitted to take advantage of any act of another which was committed upon his own request, or was caused by his own conduct. See McElvaine v. Brush, \n142 \nU.S. 155, 159\n, 35 S. L. ed. 971, 973, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 156. The question has arisen in some of the state courts, and has been so decided. See Ex parte Duckett, 15 S. C. 210, 40 Am. Rep. 694, decided in 1881; Ex parte Espalla, 109 Ala. 92, 19 So. 984, decided in 1896. In such cases the provision of the sentence that the imprisonment is to commence on or to continue from a certain day is rendered impossible of performance by the act of the defendant, and he will not be permitted to obtain an advantage in such manner. The appellant cites no case which questions this principle. Those cited by him have, generally, reference to the construction to be given the language of the sentence as to the time of its commencement. They do not deny the rule as to the action of defendant in preventing its execution.\n Johnson v. People, 83 Ill. 431, is not in point. The case arose on error brought by the defendant after conviction in the court below. He was convicted under several counts of an indictment for selling intoxicating liquors, and the sentence fixed a day and hour when the imprisonment should commence under each count. This was held to be error, as the sentence to imprisonment should have been for a specified number of days under each count upon which conviction is had, and the imprisonment under each succeeding count would begin when it ended under the preceding one, without fixing the day or hour of any. It appeared in that case that a supersedeas had been granted, and that it had become impossible that the judgment of imprisonment could be carried into effect, as the time fixed by the court had elapsed. The sentence was held to be an erroneous one, and the judgment was reversed and the case remanded, with directions that the court should enter a proper judgment on the verdict.\n In Dolan's Case, 101 Mass. 219, the prisoner, after imprisonment, had escaped before the term of the sen- \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 550]\n\u00a0\n tence had expired, and, having been retaken, claimed his discharge at the expiration of the time that he would have been entitled to it if he had not escaped. Neither the date of its commencement nor of its expiration was fixed by the terms of the sentence. His application was denied, and it was held that the defendant must be imprisoned for a time which corresponded with his original sentence, and that the expiration of the time without imprisonment was in no sense an execution of the sentence.\n Also in State v. Cockerham, 24 N. C. (2 Ired. L.) 204, it was held that the time at which the sentence should be carried into execution forms no part of the judgment. The judgment is the penalty of the law, as declared by the court, while the direction with respect to the time of carrying it into effect is in the nature of an award of execution. So here, in the case before us, the material part of the sentence is imprisonment for two years in the state prison, and that sentence is not satisfied by a detention in the county jail for a portion of the two years by reason of the proceedings of appellant to review the judgment under which the sentence was given.\n As to the time of the commencement of the sentence, State v. Gaskins, 65 N. C. 320, is based upon a statute which declared that the term of imprisonment 'shall begin to run upon, and shall include, the day of conviction.' The question did not arise by reason of the act of the defendant in taking proceedings to review the judgment.\n Woodward v. Murdock, 124 Ind. 439, 24 N. E. 1047, simply holds that the period the prisoner is out of jail under parole is part of the time for which he was sentenced, and when the original time expires he is entitled to his discharge just the same as if he had been in prison the whole time. It was held that he was constructively in prison, although in fact conditionally at large under his parole, and that while thus on parole his sentence ran on.\n The sentence given in this case could only have been satisfied by imprisonment in the state prison at San Quentin for the \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 551]\n\u00a0\n period of time mentioned in the sentence. This is not the case of an arbitrary detention in jail, without excuse or justification, after sentence to imprisonment in a state prison. If in such case the defendant were helpless, the question might arise whether the time of such improper detention in jail should not be counted, as to that extent, a satisfaction of the sentence.\n It is also objected that the sentence is void because it directs imprisonment in the state prison for a period that does not exceed one year on each count of the indictment; and Re Mills, \n135 U.S. 263\n-268, 34 L. ed. 107-110, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762, is cited to sustain the proposition.\n In that case the prisoner was sentenced upon two indictments to imprisonment in the penitentiary,-in one case for a year and in the other for six months; and it was held that the imprisonment was in violation of the statutes of the United States. See Rev. Stat.  5541, 5546, 5547 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3721, 3723, 3724).\n In the case at bar the sentence was for two years upon one indictment, and there is no statement in the record that there was a separate sentence each for one year upon the first and fourth counts of the indictment. In this we think there was no violation of the statute, and the sentence was therefore proper and legal. The appellant may have been sentenced upon one count only for two years. Although for some purposes the different counts in an indictment may be regarded as so far separate as to be in effect two different indictments, yet it is not true necessarily and in all cases. But this record shows a sentence for two years to the state prison, and there is nothing to show the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence for the crime of which the defendant was convicted.\n It is also objected that the facts charged in either the first or fourth count of the indictment did not constitute any offense under the statute, and that the sentence was therefore without jurisdiction. We are not by any means prepared to adjudge that the indictment did not properly charge an offense in both the first and fourth counts. See Dimmick v. United States, 54 C. C. A. 329, 116 Fed. 825, involving this indictment, where \n\n[194 U.S. 540, 552]\n\u00a0\n it is set forth. It is not, however, necessary in this case to decide the point, for the indictment charged enough to show the general character of the crime, and that it was within the jurisdiction of the court to try and to punish for the offense sought to be set forth in the indictment. If it erroneously held that the indictment was sufficient to charge the offense, the decision was within the jurisdiction of the court to make, and could not be re-examined on habeas corpus. The writ cannot be made to do the office of a writ of error. Even though there were, thewrefore, a lack of technical precision in the indictment in failing to charge with sufficient certainty and fulness some particular fact, the holding by the trial court that the indictment was sufficient would be simply an error of law, and not one which could be re-examined on habeas corpus. Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n, 23 L. ed. 787; Re Coy, \n127 U.S. 731\n, 32 L. ed. 274, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1263; Re $Eckart, \n166 U.S. 481\n, 41 L. ed. 1085, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638. In the last case it was stated that (page 483, L. ed. p. 1086, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 638):\n'The case is analogous in principle to that of a trial and conviction upon an indictment, the facts averred in which are asserted to be insufficient to constitute an offense against the statute claimed to have been violated. In this class of cases it has been held that a trial court possessing general jurisdiction of the class of offenses within which is embraced the crime sought to be set forth in the indictment is possessed of authority to determine the sufficiency of an indictment, and that, in adjudging it to be valid and sufficient, acts within its jurisdiction, and a conviction and judgment thereunder cannot be questioned on habeas corpus, because of a lack of certainty or other defect in the statement in the indictment of the facts averred to constitute a crime.'\n\n The order refusing the writ was right, and is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOBBINS v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES(1904)\nNo. 107\nArgued: Decided: November 14, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 223, 224]\n\u00a0\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the state of California, seeking a reversal of the judgment of that court, affirming the judgment of the superior court, dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff in error against the city of Los Angeles.\n Plaintiff in error filed a bill of complaint against the city of Los Angeles, seeking an injunction to restrain the enforcement of certain ordinances prohibiting the erection or maintenance of gasworks except within prescribed limits in said city.\n The case was decided upon demurrer to the bill. The complaint sets forth, in substance: That on August 26, 1901, the city council of Los Angeles adopted an ordinance making it unlawful to erect and maintain gasworks outside of a certain district described in the ordinance, and fixing penalties for the violation thereof. While this ordinance was in force the plaintiff in error made a contract with the Valley Gas & Fuel Company for the erection of certain gasworks upon territory to be thereafter designated by her, and on September 28, 1901, purchased lands within the limits of the privileged district as fixed by the ordinance. That on the 22d of November, 1901, upon application to the board of fire commissioners of the city of Los Angeles, that body granted to the plaintiff in error the privilege to erect the gasworks upon the territory aforesaid. Thereupon the plaintiff in error directed the Valley Gas & Fuel Company to proceed with the erection of the works upon the premises so purchased. That the foundations were constructed at a cost of upwards of $ 2,500. After the foundations had been nearly completed the city council, on November 25, \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 225]\n\u00a0\n 1901, passed a second ordinance, amending the first ordinance, and thereby so limiting the boundaries of the territory within which the erection of gasworks was permitted in said city as to include the premises of the plaintiff in error within the prohibited territory. The work of constructing the works was continuously prosecuted until the latter part of February, 1902, when the plaintiff in error alleges that the city of Los Angeles, combining and confederating with one James R. C. Burton and other persons unknown, caused certain employees of the company engaged in the erection of said works to be arrested, charged with the violation of the said city ordinance. Other arrests were made on the 1st and 3d of March, 1902. On the 3d of March, 1902, the city council passed a third ordinance, amending the ordinance of November 25, 1901, in respect to the description of the district within which gasworks could be erected. On March 6, 1902, the city caused the arrest of certain persons employed by the company in charge of the erection of the works, charged with the violation of the amended city ordinance.\n It is averred that the adoption by the city council of the ordinances aforesaid, and the attempted enforcement thereof, were instigated by officers and agents of the Los Angeles Lighting Company, a corporation engaged in manufacturing and supplying gas in said city, and having a monopoly of said business therein. It is further averred that the action of the municipal authorities complained of was taken for the purpose of protecting the said Los Angeles Lighting Company in the enjoyment of its monopoly. It is also claimed that the territory surrounding the premises of the plaintiff in error, and within which, under the ordinance of August 26, in force when the complainant made her purchase and located and began the erection of the gasworks, it was lawful so to do, and which, by the amending ordinances, was added to the prohibited territory, was and is a district devoted almost exclusively to manufacturing enterprises. Within its boundaries there is a large amount of vacant and unoccupied land which is and \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 226]\n\u00a0\n will continue to be useless except for the erection of manufacturing establishments; within which were located at that time a soap factory, a wool-pulling factory, three wineries, numerous oil wells in operation, iron foundry, brass foundry, oil refinery; immediately east of said tract, railroads and an extensive tannery; immediately north, the oil tanks and refinery of the Standard Oil Company. That the works being constructed for the plaintiff in error are to be built upon concrete foundations with a superstructure of noncombustible material, so that there can be no danger from explosion, bursting, or leaking. The machinery is to be of the most approved pattern; and that there can be no leakage or escape of odors or any interference with the health, comfort, or safety of the inhabitants of the city.\n The plaintiff in error, relying upon the protection of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, prays that the permit granted by the borad of fire commissioners be declared to be a valid and subsisting contract between the city of Los Angeles and herself, and that all ordinances passed by the city council in contravention thereof be declared void; that the defendant be enjoined from enforcing said ordinances against the plaintiff, from delaying or interfering with the action of the plaintiff in erecting the said works, from interfering with the maintenance and operation of the same, and for general relief.\n Messrs. Lynn Helm, Edward C. Bailey, Henry T. Lee, J. R. Scott, and Charles W. Chase for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 223, 232]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. Mathews and Herbert J. Goudge for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 223, 234]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n As this case was decided upon demurrer to the complaint, the allegations thereof must be taken as true. The question presented involves the right of the plaintiff in error to invoke the protection of the 14th Amendment against alleged infraction of her rights by the action of the city council in passing and enforcing the ordinances which prevent the carrying on of the business of making and selling gas to the people of the city.\n Before entering upon a consideration of the case it is essential to examine briefly the extent to which constitutional and legislative control have been exercised by authority of the state of California in reference to the erection and maintenance of gasworks in cities. The Constitution of the state,  19, article 11, provides that 'in any city where there are no public works owned and controlled by the municipality for supplying the same with water or artificial light, any individual, or any company duly incorporated for such purpose under and by authority of the laws of this state, shall, under the direction of the superintendent of streets, or other officer in control thereof, and under such general regulations as the municipality may prescribe for damages and indemnity for damages, have the privilege of using the public streets and thoroughfares thereof, and of laying down pipes and conduits therein, and connections therewith, so far as may be necessary for introducing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants either with gaslight or other illuminating light, or with fresh water for domestic and all other purposes, upon the condition that the municipal government shall have the right to regulate the charges thereof.' By the act of the state legislature of April 4, 1870 (Stat. 1869- 70, p. 815), it was provided that cities may control the location and construction of works so that they may be erected in suitable localities to give the least discomfiture or annoyance to the public. By the Constitution \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 235]\n\u00a0\n of the state of California it is provided (art. 12  11) that any county, city, town, or township may make and enforce within its limits all such local, police, sanitary, or other regulations as are not in conflict with the general laws. In these provisions may be found a grant of power to the city of Los Angeles to control the location and erection of gasworks within the city limits. In the grant of such control the fact is recognized that while the erection and maintenance of such works is a lawful business pursuit, and one essential to the welfare and comfort of the community, its prosecution requires the use of materials of such a character, and such construction and maintenance of the works, as not to be dangerous or offensive when carried on within thickly populated parts of the city; and such rights are consequently justly subject to regulation in such manner as to protect the public health and safety. The supreme court of California, as may be gathered from its opinion in this case, based its decision upon the proposition that, as the exercise of the right to control the location and construction of gasworks is within the power conferred by the legislature upon the city, the act of the municipality in question cannot be reviewed, because so to do would be a substitution of the judgment of the court for that of the council upon a matter left within the exclusive control of the legislative body. To support this conclusion a citation is made from the opinion of this court in the case of Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 24 L. ed. 77, to the effect that the legislature is the exclusive judge of the propriety of police regulation when the matter is within the scope of its power. The observations of Mr. Chief Justice Waite in that connection had reference to the facts of the particular case and were certainly not intended to declare the right of either the legislature or a city council to arbitrarily deprive the citizen of rights protected by the Constitution, under the guise of exercising the police powers reserved to the states. It may be admitted that every intendment is to be made in favor of the lawfulness of the exercise of municipal power, making regulations to promote the public health and \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 236]\n\u00a0\n safety, and that it is not the province of courts, except in clear cases, to interfere with the exercise of the power reposed by law in municipal corporations for the protection of local rights and the health and welfare of the people in the community. But notwithstanding this general rule of the law, it is now thoroughly well settled by decisions of this court that municipal by-laws and ordinances, and even legislative enactments undertaking to regulate useful business enterprises, are subject to investigation in the courts with a view to determining whether the law or ordinance is a lawful exercise of the police power, or whether, under the guise of enforcing police regulations, there has been unwarranted and arbitrary interference with the constitutional rights to carry on a lawful business, to make contracts, or to use and enjoy property. In Lawton v. Steele, \n152 U.S. 133\n-137, 38 L. ed. 385-388, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499-501, Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court, said upon this subject:\n'To justify the state in thus interposing its authority in behalf of the public it must appear, first, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require such interference; and, second, that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not undly oppressive upon individuals. The legislature may not, under the guise of protecting the public interests, arbitrarily interfere with private business or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police powers is not final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts.'\n\n And, again, in Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 42 L. ed. 780, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383, the same justice, again speaking for the court, said:\n'The question in each case is whether the legislature has adopted the statute in exercise of a reasonable discretion, or whether its action be a mere excuse for an unjust discrimination, or the oppression or spoliation of a particular class.'\n\n And in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 558\n, 46 S. L. ed. 679, 689, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, 438, Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 237]\n\u00a0\n 'The question of constitutional law to which we have referred [the equal protection of the laws] cannot be disposed of by saying that the statute in question may be referred to what are called the police powers of the state, which, as often stated by this court, were not included in the grants of power to the general government, and therefore were reserved to the states when the Constitution was ordained. But, as the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, anything in the Constitution or statutes of the states to the contrary notwithstanding, a statute of a state, even when avowedly enacted in the exercise of its police powers, must yield to that law. No right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States can be impaired or destroyed by a state enactment, whatever may be the source from which the power to pass such enactment may have been derived. 'The nullity of any act inconsistent with the Constitution is produced by the declaration that the Constitution is the supreme law.' The state has undoubtedly the power, by appropriate legislation, to protect the public morals, the public health, and the public safety; but if, by their necessary operation, its regulations looking to either of those ends amount to a denial to persons within its jurisdiction of the equal protection of the laws, they must be deemed unconstitutional and void. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210, 6 L. ed. 23, 73; Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243, 16 L. ed. 243, 247; Missouri, K . & T. R. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 626\n, 42 S. L. ed. 878, 882, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488.'\n This principle was recognined and applied in the supreme court of California in a case decided later than the one under consideration (Re Smith, decided May 31, 1904, 143 Cal. 368, 77 Pac. 180), in which it was held that a county ordinance making it a misdemeanor to maintain a gasworks within a sparsely settled district was unreasonable and void. In that case the court, after again quoting from Munn v. Illinois, to the effect that the courts will not interfere with laws which are within the scope of legislative power, well said:\n'But running current with this principle, and to be read with it, is one of equal importance,-namely, that when the \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 238]\n\u00a0\n police power is exerted to regulate a useful business or occupation, the legislature is not the exclusive judge as to what is a reasonable and just restraint upon the constitutional right of the citizen to pursue any trade, business, or vocation which in itself is recognized as innocent and useful to the community. It is always a judicial question if any particular regulation of such right is a valid exercise of police power, though the authority of the courts to declare such regulation invalid will be exercised with the utmost caution, and only when it is clear that the ordinance or law declared void passes the limits of the police power, and infringes upon rights guaranteed by the Constitution.'\n\n Applying the principles settled by these decisions to the allegations of the bill, admitted by the demurrer, we think a case is made which called for the protection of the courts against arbitrary interference with the rights of the plaintiff in error. Complying with the terms of the ordinance which was in force when the plaintiff in error was about to begin the erection of the gasworks in controversy, a tract of land was purchased within the district wherein the erection of such works was permitted, a contract was entered into for the construction of the works, a considerable sum of money was expended. It may be admitted as being a correct statement of the law as held by the California supreme court that, notwithstanding the grant of the permit, and even after the erection of the works, the city might still, for the protection of the public health and safety, prohibit the further maintenance and continuance of such works, and the prosecution of the business, originally harmless, may become, by reason of the manner of its prosecution or a changed condition of the community, a menace to the public health and safety. In other words, the right to exercise the police power is a continuing one, and a business lawful to-day may, in the future, because of the changed situation, the growth of population, or other causes, become a menace to the public health and welfare, and be required to yield to the public good. North Western Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 239]\n\u00a0\n Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n, 24 L. ed. 1036; New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Louisiana Light & H. P. & Mfg. Co. \n115 U.S. 672\n, 29 L. ed. 524, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252. But the exercise of the police power is subject to judicial revies, and property rights cannot be wrongfully destroyed by arbitrary enactment. It was averred that the works would be so constructed as not to interfere with the health or safety of the people. No reasonable explanation for the arbitrary exercise of power in the case is suggested. The narrowing of the limits within which the plaintiff in error, in compliance with the ordinance of the city and the permit of the board of fire commissioners, was proceeding to erect the gasworks, to the smaller and more limited section, was not demanded by the public welfare, and, taking the facts as alleged in the bill, seems rather to have been actuated by the purpose to exclude the plaintiff in error from further prosecution of the enterprise. The limits of the privileged district were fixed late in August. In September the complainant began the construction of the works. In November, without changed conditions or adequate reason, the council, by an amended ordinance, draw a line embracing a part of the district including the complainant's property, and declare that, too, shall be prohibited territory. This action is strongly corroborative of the allegations of the bill that the purpose was not police regulation in the interest of the public, but the destruction of the plaintiff's rights, and the building up of another company still within the privileged district after the passage of the amendment. Being the owner of the land, and having partially erected the works, the plaintiff in error had acquired property rights, and was entitled to protection against unconstitutional encroachments which would have the effect to deprive her of her property without due process of law. It is averred in the bill of complaint that the district within which the works were being erected was one given over to manufacturing enterprises, some of which were fully as obnoxious as gasworks possibly could be; that it contained large spaces of unoccupied lands, worthless except for manufacturing purposes, and, by clear inference, that there was \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 240]\n\u00a0\n nothing in the situation which rendered it necessary, in order to protect the city from a noisome and unhealthy business, to decrease the area within which gasworks could lawfully be erected.\n It is urged that, where the exercise of legislative or municipal power is clearly within constitutional limits, the courts will not inquire into the motives which may have actuated the legislative body in passing the law or ordinance in question. Whether, when it appears that the facts would authorize the exercise of the power, the courts will restrain its exercise because of alleged wrongful motives inducing the passage of an ordinance, is not a question necessary to be determined in this case; but where the facts as to the situation and conditions are such as to establish the exercise of the police power in such manner as to oppress or discriminate against a class or an individual, the courts may consider and give weight to such purpose in considering the validity of the ordinance. This court in the case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 U.S. 356\n, 30 L. ed. 220, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064, held that, although an ordinance might be lawful upon its face, and apparently fair in its terms, yet, if it was enforced in such a manner as to work a discrimination against a part of the community, for no lawful reason, such exercise of power would be invalidated by the courts.\n In some of the states, perhaps in most, the right to build and maintain gasworks is derived from the state, but subject to municipal control as to the use of the streets and the prices to be charged to consumers. In Ohio this price is regulated for stated periods. Could it be successfully maintained that, after the erection of the works, and the fixing of prices for a term of ten years, at the expiration thereof, and exercising the right to fix prices for a new term, the council could arbitrarily, and with a view of compelling the sale of the works to the municipality or a rival company, fix the rate at a price below the cost of gas to the producer, and at such a rate as to be ruinous to the business? In State ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Cincinnati Gaslight & Coke Co. 18 Ohio St. 262, it was \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 241]\n\u00a0\n held to be the legislative intention, in empowering city councils to regulate the price of gas, to limit such companies to fair and reasonable prices, and if, in the colorable exercise of this power, a majority of the members of the council, for a fraudulent purpose, combine to pass an ordinance fixing the price of gas at a rate at which they well know it cannot be manufactured and sold without loss, such an ordinance would impose no obligation on the company. This case was cited with apparent approval by Mr. Justice Matthews in delivering the opinion of this court in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. s. 356, 30 L. ed. 220, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064; and see Dill. Mun. Corp. 4th ed.  311.\n In this case we think the allegations of the bill disclose such character of territory, such sudden and unexplained change of its limits after the plaintiff in error had purchased the property and gone forward with the erection of the works, as to bring it within that class of cases wherein the court may restrain the arbitrary and discriminatory exercise of the police power which amounts to a taking of property without due process of law and an impairment of property rights protected by the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n It is also urged by the defendants in error that a court of equity will not enjoin prosecution of a criminal case; but, as we have seen, the plaintiff in error in this case had acquired property rights which, by the enforcement of the ordinances in question, would be destroyed and rendered worthless. If the allegations of the bill be taken as true, she had the right to proceed with the prosecution of the work without interference by the city authorities in the form of arrest and prosecution of those in her employ.\n It is well settled that, where property rights will be destroyed, unlawful interference by criminal proceedings under a void law or ordinance may be reached and controlled by a decree of a court of equity. Davis & F. Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 U.S. 207\n-218, 47 L. ed. 778-780, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, and cases therein cited.\n Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the demurrer \n\n[195 U.S. 223, 242]\n\u00a0\n should have been overruled and the city of Los Angeles put upon its answer.\n For the reasons herein stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of California is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not in conflict with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDORR v.

For the present purpose it is only necessary to state certain conclusions which are deemed to be established by prior adjudications, and are decisive of this case.\n It may be regarded as settled that the Constitution of the United States is the only source of power authorizing action by any branch of the Federal government. 'The government of the United States was born of the Constitution, and all powers which it enjoys or may exercise must be either derived expressly or by implication from that instrument.' Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and cases cited. It is equally well settled that the United States may acquire territory in the exercise of the treaty-making power by direct cession as the result of war, and in making effectual the terms of peace; and for that purpose has the powers of other sovereign nations. This principle has been recognized by this court from its earliest decisions. The convention which framed the Constitution of the United States, in view of the territory already possessed and the possibility of acquiring more, inserted in that instrument, in article 4,  3, a grant of express power to Congress 'to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'\n As early as the February term, 1810, of this court, in the case of Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cranch, 332, 3 L. ed. 240, Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'The power of governing and of legislating for a territory is the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire and to hold territory. Could this position be contested, the Constitution of the United States declares that 'Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.' Accordingly we find Congress possessing and exercising the absolute and undisputed power of governing and legislating for the territory of Orleans. Congress has \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n given them a legislative, an executive, and a judiciary, with such powers as it has been their will to assign to those departments respectively.'\n\n And later, the same eminent judge, delivering the opinion of the court in the leading case upon the subject (American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 542, 7 L. ed. 242, 255), says:\n'The Constitution confers absolutely on the government of the Union the powers of making war and of making treaties; consequently that government possesses the power of acquiring territory, either by conquest or by treaty.\n\n'The usage of the world is, if a nation be not entirely subdued, to consider the holding of conquered territory as a mere military occupation, until its fate shall be determined at the treaty of peace. If it be ceded by the treaty, the acquisition is confirmed, and the ceded territory becomes a part of the nation to which it is annexed, either on the terms stipulated in the treaty of cession, or on such as its new master shall impose. On such transfer of territory it has never been held that the relations of the inhabitants with each other undergo any change. Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved, and new relations are created between them and the government which has acquired their territory. The same act which transfers their country transfers the allegiance of those who remain in it; and the law, which may be denominated political, is necessarily changed, although that which regulates the intercourse and general conduct of individuals remains in force until altered by the newly- created power of the state.\n\n'On the 22d of February, 1819, Spain ceded Florida to the United States. The 6th article of the treaty of cession contains the following provision: 'The inhabitants of the territories which His Catholic Majesty cedes the United States by this treaty shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States.' [8 Stat. at L. 256.] \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n 'This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether this is not their condition, independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government till Florida shall become a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a territory of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress 'to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.\"\n\n While these cases, and others which are cited in the late case of Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, sustain the right of Congress to make laws for the government of territories, without being subject to all the restrictions which are imposed upon that body when passing laws for the United States, considered as a political body of states in union, the exercise of the power expressly granted to govern the territories is not without limitations. Speaking of this power, Mr. Justice Curtis, in the case of Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 614, 15 L. ed. 787, said:\n'If, then, this clause does contain a power to legislate respecting the territory, what are the limits of that power?\n\n'To this I answer that, in common with all the other legislative powers of Congress, if finds limits in the express prohibitions on Congress not to do certain things; that, in the exercise of the legislative power, Congress cannot pass an ex post facto law or bill of attainder; and so in respect to each of the other prohibitions contained in the Constitution.'\n\n In every case where Congress undertakes to legislate in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, the question may arise as to how far the exercise of the power is limited by the 'prohibitions' of that instrument. The limitations which are to be applied in any given case involving territorial government must depend upon the relation of the particular territory to the United States, concerning which Congress is exercising the power conferred by the Constitution. That \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n the United States may have territory which is not incorporated into the United States as a body politic, we think was recognized by the framers of the Constitution in enacting the article already considered, giving power over the territories, and is sanctioned by the opinions of the justices concurring in the judgment in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770.\n Until Congress shall see fit to incorporate territory ceded by treaty into the United States, we regard it as settled by that decision that the territory is to be governed under the power existing in Congress to make laws for such territories, and subject to such constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are applicable to the situation.\n For this case the practical question is, Must Congress, in establishing a system for trial of crimes and offenses committed in the Philippine Islands, carry to their people by proper affirmative legislation a system of trial by jury?\n If the treaty-making power could incorporate territory into the United States without congressional action, it is apparent that the treaty with Spain, ceding the Philippines to the United States [30 Stat. at L. 1759], carefully refrained from so doing; for it is expressly provided that (article 9): 'The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress.' In this language it is clear that it was the intention of the framers of the treaty to reserve to Congress, so far as it could be constitutionally done, a free hand in dealing with these newly- acquired possessions.\n The legislation upon the subject shows that not only has Congress hitherto refrained from incorporating the Philippines into the United States, but in the act of 1902, providing for temporary civil government ( 32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369), there is express provision that  1891 of the Revised Statutes of 1878 shall not apply to the Philippine Islands. This is the section giving force and effect to the Constitution and laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, within all the organized territories, and every \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n territory thereafter organized, as elsewhere within the United States.\n The requirements of the Constitution as to a jury are found in article 3,  2:\n'The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the states where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.'\n\n And in article 6 of the amendments to the Constitution:\n'In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.'\n\n It was said in the Mankichi Case, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, that when the territory had not been incorporated into the United States these requirements were not limitations upon the power of Congress in providing a government for territory in execution of the powers conferred upon Congress. Opinion of Mr. Justice White, p. 220, citing Hurtado v. California, \n110 U.S. 516\n, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292; Re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 473\n, 35 S. L. ed. 581, 589, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 897; Bolln v. Nebraska, \n176 U.S. 83\n, 44 L. ed. 382, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, and cases cited on page 86, L. ed. p. 383, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 288; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581, 584\n, 44 S. L. ed. 597, 598, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494; Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770.\n In the same case Mr. Justice Brown, in the course of his opinion, said:\n'We would even go farther, and say that most, if not all, the privileges and immunities contained in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution were intended to apply from the moment of annexation; but we place our decision of this case upon the ground that the two rights alleged to be violated in this case [right to trial by jury and presentment by grand jury] are not fundamental in their nature, but concern merely a method \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n of procedure which sixty years of practice had shown to be suited to the conditions of the islands, and well calculated to conserve the rights of their citizens to their lives, their property, and their well being.'\n\n As we have had occasion to see in the case of Kepner v. United States, 194 U. S. --, ante, 797, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, the President, in his instructions to the Philippine Commission, while impressing the necessity of carrying into the new government the guaranties of the Bill of Rights securing those safeguards to life and liberty which are deemed essential to our government, was careful to reserve the right to trial by jury, which was doubtless due to the fact that the civilized portion of the islands had a system of jurisprudence founded upon the civil law, and the uncivilized parts of the archipelago were wholly unfitted to exercise the right of trial by jury. The Spanish system, in force in the Philippines, gave the right to the accused to be tried before judges, who acted in effect as a court of inquiry, and whose judgments were not final until passed in review before the audiencia, or superior court, with right of final review, and power to grant a new trial for errors of law, in the supreme court at Madrid. To this system the Philippine Commission, in executing the power conferred by the orders of the President, and sanctioned by act of Congress (act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369), has added a guaranty of the right of the accused to be heard by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to have compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf. And, further, that no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law, nor be put twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense, nor be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. As appears in the Kepner Case, 194 U. S. --, ante, 797, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, the accused is given the right of appeal from the judgment of the court of first instance to the supreme court, and, in capital cases, the case goes to the latter court without appeal. \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n It cannot be successfully maintained that this system does not give an adequate and efficient method of protecting the rights of the accused as well as executing the criminal law by judicial proceedings which give full opportunity to be heard by competent tribunals before judgment can be pronounced. Of course, it is a complete answer to this suggestion to say, if such be the fact, that the constitutional requirements as to a jury trial, either of their own force or as limitations upon the power of Congress in setting up a government, must control in all the territory, whether incorporated or not, of the United States. But is this a reasonable interpretation of the power conferred upon Congress to make rules and regulations for the territories?\n The cases cited have firmly established the power of the United States, like other sovereign nations, to acquire, by the methods known to civilized peoples, additional territory. The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the possibility of future extension by acquiring territory outside the states, did not leave to implication alone the power to govern and control territory owned or to be acquired, but, in the article quoted, expressly conferred the needful powers to make regulations. Regulations in this sense must mean laws, for, as well as states, territories must be governed by laws. The limitations of this power were suggested by Mr. Justice Curtis in the Scott Case, above quoted, and Mr. Justice Bradley, in the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S. v. United States, \n136 U.S. 1\n, 34 L. ed. 481, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 792, said:\n'Doubtless Congress, in legislating for the territories, would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its amendments; but these limitations would exist rather by inference and the general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers, than by any express and direct application of its provisions.'\n\n This language was quoted with approbation by Mr. Justice Brown in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n-288, 45 L. ed. 1088-1106, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and in the same case Mr. Justice White said: \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n 'Whilst, therefore, there is no express or implied limitation on Congress in exercising its power to create local governments for any and all of the territories, by which that body is restrained from the widest latitude of discretion, it does not follow that there may not be inherent, although unexpressed, principles which are the basis of all free government, which cannot be with impunity transcended. But this does not suggest that every express limitation of the Constitution which is applicable has not force, but only signifies that even in cases where there is no direct command of the Constitution which applies, there may nevertheless be restrictions of so fundamental a nature that they cannot be transgressed, although not expressed in so many words in the Constitution.'\n In treating of article 4,  3, Judge Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Law, says:\n'The peculiar wording of the provision [ 3, article 4] has led some persons to suppose that it was intended Congress should exercise, in respect to the territory, the rights only of a proprietor of property, and that the people of the territories were to be left at liberty to institute governments for themselves. It is no doubt most consistent with the general theory of republican institutions that the people everywhere should be allowed self-government; but it has never been deemed a matter of right that a local community should be suffered to lay the foundations of institutions, and erect a structure of government thereon, without the guidance and restraint of a superior authority. Even in the older states, where society is most homogeneous and has fewest of the elements of disquiet and disorder, the state reserves to itself the right to shape municipal institutions; and towns and cities are only formed under its directions, and according to the rules and within the limits the state prescribes. With still less reason could the settlers in new territories be suffered to exercise sovereign powers. The practice of the government, originating before the adoption of the Constitution, has been for Congress to establish governments for the territories; and \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n whether the jurisdiction over the district has been acquired by grant from the states, or by treaty with a foreign power, Congress has unquestionably full power to govern it; and the people, except as Congress shall provide for, are not of right entitled to participate in political authority until the territory becomes a state. Meantime they are in a condition of temporary pupilage and dependence; and while Congress will be expected to recognize the principle of self-government to such extent as may seem wise, its discretion alone can constitute the measure by which the participation of the people can be determined.' Cooley, Principles of Const. Law, 164.\n\n If the right to trial by jury were a fundamental right which goes wherever the jurisdiction of the United States extends, or if Congress, in framing laws for outlying territory belonging to the United States, was obliged to establish that system by affirmative legislation, it would follow that, no matter what the needs or capacities of the people, trial by jury, and in no other way, must be forthwith established, although the result may be to work injustice and provoke disturbance rather than to aid the orderly administration of justice. If the United States, impelled by its duty or advantage, shall acquire territory people by savages, and of which it may dispose or not hold for ultimate admission to statehood, if this doctrine is sound, it must establish there the trial by jury. To state such a proposition demonstrates the impossibility of carrying it into practice. Again, if the United States shall acquire by treaty the cession of territory having an established system of jurisprudence, where jury trials are unknown, but a method of fair and orderly trial prevails under an acceptable and long-established code, the preference of the people must be disregarded, their established customs ignored, and they themselves coerced to accept, in advance of incorporation into the United States, a system of trial unknown to them and unsuited to their needs. We do not think it was intended, in giving power to Congress to make regulations for the territories, to hamper its exercise with this condition. \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that the power to govern territory, implied in the right to acquire it, and given to Congress in the Constitution in article 4,  3, to whatever other limitations it may be subject, the extent of which must be decided as questions arise, does not require that body to enact for ceded territory not made a part of the United States by Congressional action, a system of laws which shall include the right of trial by jury, and that the Constitution does not, without legislation, and of its own force, carry such right to territory so situated.\n Other assignments of error bring further questions before the court which we will proceed to notice. The case was a prosecution for libel, brought at the instance of Don Benito Legarda, a member of the Philippine Commission, against the plaintiffs in error, Dorr and O'Brien, who were proprietors and editors of a newspaper published in the city of Manila known as the 'Manila Freedom.' It appears that Legarda was the prosecuting witness against one Valdez, editor of a certain Spanish newspaper called the 'Miau.' At the time of the trial of Valdez, under the Spanish law then in force in the islands, the truth could not be given in defense in a prosecution for criminal libel. Notwithstanding this fact, counsel for Valdez, in the form of an offer of proof, read a paper in court, making certain statements with reference to the libel charged, tending to show the truth thereof. In what purported to be a report of the proceeding, the Manila Freedom printed an article containing the matter set forth in the offer to prove, with headlines in large type, as follows:\n'TRAITOR, SEDUCER, AND PERJURER.\n\n SENSATIONAL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMMISSIONER LEGARDA.\n MADE OF RECORD AND READ IN ENGLISH-SPANISH READING WAIVED.\n Wife would have killed him.\n Legarda pale and nervous.'\n The prosecution of the plaintiffs in error was based upon the \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 150]\n\u00a0\n publication of these headlines, which were charged to be a false and malicious libel, printed in the English language, of and concerning Don Benito Legarda. At the time Valdez was tried, in which case the occurrence undertaken to be reported took place, the Spanish law was in force, denying the right to put in evidence the truth of the alleged libelous matter. At the time of the trial of the plaintiffs in error the Philippine Commission had passed act No. 277, known as the libel law:\n [No. 277.]\n'An Act Defining the Law of Libel and Threats to Publish a Libel, Making Libel and Threats to Publish Libel Misdemeanors, Giving a Right of Civil Action Therefor, and Making Obscene or Indecent Publications Misdemeanors.\n\n'By authority of the President of the United States, be it enacted by the United States Philippine Commission that: Sec. 1. A libel is a malicious defamation, expressed either in writing, printing, or by signs or pictures, or the like, or public theatrical exhibitions, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead or to impeach the honesty, virtue, or reputation, or publish the alleged or natural defects of one who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 4. In all criminal prosecutions for libel the truth may be given in evidence to the court, and if it appears to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true, and was published with good motives, and for justifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven, but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 6. Every author, editor, or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in any part of such book or number of each newspaper or serial, as fully as if he were the author of the same. \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 151]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 7. No reporter, editor, or proprietor of any newspaper is liable to any prosecution for a fair and true report of any judicial, legislative, or other public official proceedings, or of any statement, speech, argument, or debate in the course of the same, except upon proof of malice in making such report, which shall not be implied from the mere fact of publication.\n\n'Sec. 8. Libelous remarks or comments connected with matter privileged by the last section receive no privilege by reason of being so connected.\n\n ... * *\n'Enacted October 24, 1901.'\n\n The contention is that the publication is privileged under  7 and 8, the claim being that the publication was a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings. Testimony was introduced in the court below tending to show malice, and there was no proof to support the truth of the charges in the alleged libel, which were found to be without basis and wanton, and as the findings of the two lower courts in a case brought in review here are not ordinarily disturbed, the case upon this branch might rest upon that proposition. It is evident, however, that the publication in question did not stop with a simple report of the judicial proceedings. Indeed, the paper offered in evidence could not have been received under the law then in force,-a fact concerning which no comment was made in the report of the proceedings. Furthermore,  8 of the law, while permitting, as privileged, a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings, except upon express proof of malice, does not make privileged libelous remarks or comments in connection with the privileged matter. The draftsman of the law evidently had in mind the law of criminal libel in newspaper publications as it exists in this country. The privilege extends to a full and correct report of judicial proceedings without prejudicial comment. The rule is nowhere better stated than by Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed., p. 637: \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 152]\n\u00a0\n 'It seems to be settled that a fair and impartial account of judicial proceedings, which have not been ex parte, but in the hearing of both parties, is, generally speaking, a justifiable publication. But it is said that if a party is to be allowed to publish what passes in a court of justice, he must publish the whole case, and not merely state the conclusion which he himself draws from the evidence. A plea that the supposed libel was, in substance, a true account and report of a trial, has been held bad; and a statement of the circumstances of a trial as from counsel in the case has been held not privileged. The report must also be strictly confined to the actual proceedings in court, and must contain no defamatory observations or comments from any quarter whatsoever, in addition to what forms strictly and properly the legal proceedings.'\n Many cases are cited by the learned author in support of this conclusion. In Hayes v. Press Co. 127 Pa. 642, 5 L. R. A. 643, 14 Am. St. Rep. 874, 18 Atl. 331, headlines stating 'Hotel Proprietors Embarrassed,' in giving an account of a judgment rendered in the suit of a bank against the proprietors of a certain hotel, was held not privileged. In Newell on Defamation, Slander and Libel, chap. 19,  163, the author says:\n'The publisher must add nothing of his own. He must not state his opinion of the conduct of the parties, or impute motives therefor; he must not insinuate that a particular witness committed perjury. That is not a report of what occurred; it is simply his comment on what occurred, and to this no privilege attaches. Often such comments may be justified on another ground,-that they are fair and bona fide criticism on a matter of public interest, and are therefore not libelous. But such observations, to which quite different considerations apply, should not be mixed up with the history of the case. Lord Campbell said: 'If any comments are made, they should not be made as part of the report. The report should be confined to what takes place in court; and the two things-report and comment-should be kept \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 153]\n\u00a0\n separate.' And all sensational headings to reports should be avoided.' Thomas v. Croswell, 7 Johns. 264, 5 Am. Dec. 269.\n\n These headlines were not privileged matter at the common law, and were libelous remarks or comments if the matter could be deemed otherwise privileged, within the meaning of  8 of the Philippine libel law. An inspection of them would seem to be sufficient to demonstrate this fact. The complainant was held up to the public where the paper circulated in striking headlines as 'Traitor, Seducer, Perjurer,' and while these words were quoted, as well as the phrase 'Wife would have killed him,' their publication in this manner was certainly the equivalent to a remark or comment unnecessary to a fair and truthful report of judicial proceedings, and likely to raise inferences highly detrimental to the character and standing of the one concerning whom they were printed and published.\n Further error is assigned in that act No. 277 of the laws of the Philippine Commission was not passed by competent legal authority. The act was one of the laws of the Philippine Commission, passed by that body by virtue of the authority given the President under the so-called Spooner resolution of March 2, 1901 [31 Stat. at L. 910, chap. 803]. The right of Congress to authorize a temporary government of this character is not open to question at this day. The power has been frequently exercised and is too well settled to require further discussion. De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 196\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1041, 1056, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, concurring:\n I concur in the result of the opinion of the court in this case, which upholds the conviction of the plaintiffs in error on a trial at Manila, Philippine Islands, for a criminal offense, without a jury. I do so simply because of the decision in Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787. That case was decided by the concurring views of a majority of this court, and although \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 154]\n\u00a0\n I did not and do not concur in those views, yet the case in my opinion is authority for the result arrived at in the case now before us, to wit, that a jury trial is not a constitutional necessity in a criminal case in Hawaii or in the Philippine Islands. But, while concurring in this judgment, I do not wish to be understood as assenting to the view that Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, is to be regarded as authority for the decision herein. That case is authority only for the proposition that the plaintiff therein was not entitled to recover the amount of duties he had paid under protest upon the importation into the city of New York of certain oranges from the port of San Juan, in the Island of Porto Rico, in November, 1900, after the passage of the act known as the Foraker act [31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191]. The various reasons advanced by the judges in reaching this conclusion, which were not concurred in by a majority of the court, are plainly not binding. The Mankichi Case is, however, directly in point, and calls for an affirmance of this judgment.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Brewer agree in this concurring opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I do not believe now any more than I did when Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, was decided, that the provisions of the Federal Constitution as to grand and petit juries relate to mere methods of procedure, and are not fundamental in their nature. In my opinion, guaranties for the protection of life, liberty, and property, as embodied in the Constitution, are for the benefit of all, of whatever race or nativity, in the states composing the Union, or in any territory, however acquired, over the inhabitants of which the government of the United States may exercise the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.\n The Constitution declares that no person, except in the land \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 155]\n\u00a0\n or naval forces, shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, except on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury; and forbids the conviction, in a criminal prosecution, of any person, for any crime, except on the unanimous verdict of a petit jury composed of twelve persons. Necessarily, that mandate was addressed to every one committing crime punishable by the United States. This court, however, holds that these provisions are not fundamental, and may be disregarded in any territory acquired in the manner the Philippine Islands were acquired, although, as heretofore decided by this court, they could not be disregarded in what are commonly called the organized territories of the United States. Thompson v. Utah, \n170 U.S. 343\n, 42 L. ed. 1061, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620. I cannot assent to this interpretation of the Constitution. It is, I submit, so obviously inconsistent with the Constitution that I cannot regard the judgment of the court otherwise than as an amendment of that instrument by judicial construction, when a different mode of amendment is expressly provided for. Grand juries and petit juries may be, at times, somewhat inconvenient in the administration of criminal justice in the Philippines. But such inconveniences are of slight consequence compared with the dangers to our system of government arising from judicial amendments of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that it 'shall be the supreme law of the land.' But the court in effect adjudges that the Philippine Islands are not part of the 'land,' within the meaning of the Constitution, although they are governed by the sovereign authority of the United States, and although their inhabitants are subject in all respects to its jurisdiction,-as much so as are the people in the District of Columbia or in the several states of the Union. No power exists in the judiciary to suspend the operation of the Constitution in any territory governed, as to its affairs and people, by authority of the United States. As a Filipino committing the crime of murder in the Philippine Islands may be hung by the sovereign authority of the United States, and as the Philippine Islands are under a \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 156]\n\u00a0\n civil, not military, government, the suggestion that he may not, of right, appeal for his protection to the jury provisions of the Constitution, which constitutes the only source of the power that the government may exercise at any time or at any place, is utterly revolting to my mind, and can never receive my sanction. The Constitution, without excepting from its provisions any persons over whom the United States may exercise jurisdiction, declares expressly that 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.' It is now adjudged that that provision is not fundamental in respect of a part of the people over whom the United States may exercise full legislative, judicial and executive power. Indeed, it is adjudged, in effect, that the above clause, in its application to this case, is to be construed as if it read: 'The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, and except where Filipinos are concerned, shall be by jury.' Such a mode of constitutional interpretation plays havoc with the old-fashioned ideas of the fathers, who took care to say that the Constitution was the supreme law,-supreme everywhere, at all times, and over all persons who are subject to the authority of the United States. According to the principles of the opinion just rendered, neither the governor nor any American civil officer in the Philippines, although citizens of the United States, although under an oath to support the Constitution, and although in those distant possessions for the purpose of enforcing the authority of the United States, can claim, of right, the benefit of the jury provisions of the Constitution, if tried for crime committed on those Islands. Besides there are many thousands of American soldiers in the Philippines. They are there by command of the United States, to enforce its authority. They carry the flag of the United States, and have not lost their American citizenship. Yet, if charged in the Philippines with having committed a crime against the United States of which a civil tribunal may take cognizance, they cannot, under the present decision, claim of right a trial by jury. So that, if an \n\n[195 U.S. 138, 157]\n\u00a0\n American soldier, in discharge of his duty to his country, goes into what some call our 'outlying dependencies,' he is, it seems, 'outside of the Constitution,' in respect of a right which this court has said was justly 'dear to the American people,' and has 'always been an object of deep interest and solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has been watched with great jealousy;' a right which, Mr. Justice Story said, was, from very early times, insisted on by our ancestors in the parent country 'as the great bulwark of their civil and political liberties.' Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 436, 7 L. ed. 732, 733; 2 Story, Const.  1779. Referring to the declaration by a French writer, that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage having lost their liberties, those of England must in time perish, Blackstone observed that the writer 'should have recollected that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, at the time their liberties were lost, were strangers to the trial by jury.' 2 Bl. Com. 379.\n In a former case I had occasion to say, and I still think, that 'neither the life, nor the liberty, nor the property of any person, within any territory or country over which the United States is sovereign, can be taken, under the sanction of any civil tribunal, acting under its authority, by any form of procedure inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States;' that 'the Constitution is the supreme law in every territory, as soon as it comes under the sovereign dominion of the United States for purposes of civil administration, and whose inhabitants are under its entire authority and jurisdiction.' [Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787.]\n My views as to the scope and meaning of the provisions of the Constitution which relate to grand and petit juries, and as to the relations of the United States to our newly acquired possessions, have been more fully stated in cases heretofore decided in this court, and I have therefore not deemed it\n Hurtado v.

BROWN(1904)\nNo. 171\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Altheus Johnson and Joseph A. Burkart for appellant and plaintiff in error. \n\n[193 U.S. 411, 412]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas Watts for appellees and defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in this case is whether the following instrument is entitled to probate:\n Washington, D. C. Aug. 31\"\/001.\n I am going on a Journey and may, not ever return. And if I do not, this is my last request. The Mortgage on the King House, which is in the possession of Mr. H. H.

C, All I have is my one hard earnings and and I propose to leave it to whome I please.\n Caroline Holley.\n The case was heard on the petition, an answer denying the allegations of the same, except on a point here immaterial, and \n\n[193 U.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n setting up that the residence of the deceased was in New York, and upon a stipulation that the instrument was written and signed by the deceased on August 31, 1901, and that she went on her journey, returned to Washington, resumed her occupation there as a clerk in the Treasury Department, and died there on December 17, 1901. Probate was denied by the supreme court, with costs against the appellant, and this decree was affirmed by the court of appeals upon the ground that the will was conditioned upon an event which did not come to pass. It will be noticed that the domicil of the testatrix in Washington was not admitted in terms. But the court of appeals assumed the allegation of the petition that she was domiciled in, Washington to be true, and obviously it must have been understood not to be disputed. The argument for the appellee does not mention the point. The petition also sets up certain subsequent declarations of the deceased as amounting to a republication of the will after the alleged failure of condition; but, as these are denied by the answer, they do not come into consideration here.\n It might be argued that logically the only question upon the probate was the factum of the instrument. Pohlman v. Untzellman, 2 Lee Eccl. Rep. 319, 320. But the practice is well settled to deny probate if it clearly appears from the contents of the instrument, coupled with the admitted facts, that it is inoperative in the event which has happened. Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Ves. Sr. 189, Ambler, 557, 1 Wils. 243; Sinclair v. Hone, 6 Ves. 607, 610; Roberts v. Roberts, 2 Swabey & T. 337; Lindsay v. Lindsay, L. R. 2 P. & D. 459; Todd's Will, 2 Watts & S. 145. The only question, therefore, is whether the instrument is void because of the return of the deceased from her contemplated journey. As to this, it cannot be disputed that grammatically and literally the words 'if I do not' [return] are the condition of the whole 'last request.' There is no doubt either of the danger in going beyond the literal and grammatical meaning of the words. The English courts are especially and wisely careful not to substitute a lively imagination of what a testatrix \n\n[193 U.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n would have said if her attention had been directed to a particular point for what she has said in fact. On the other hand, to a certain extent, not to be exactly defined, but depending on judgment and tact, the primary import of isolated words may be held to be modified and controlled by the dominant intention, to be gathered from the instrument as a whole. Bearing these opposing considerations in mind, the court is of opinion that the will should be admitted to proof.\n'Courts do not incline to regard a will as conditional where it can be reasonably held that the testator was merely expressing his inducement to make it, however inaccurate his use of language might be, if strictly construed.' Damon v. Damon, 8 Allen, 192, 197. Lord Penzance puts the same proposition perhaps even more strongly in Porter's Goods, L. R. 2 Prob. & Div. 22, 23; and it is almost a commonplace. In the case at bar we have an illiterate woman writing her own will. Obviously the first sentence, 'I am going on a journey and may not ever return,' expresses the fact which was on her mind as the occasion and inducement for writing it. If that had been the only reference to the journey the sentence would have had no further meaning. Cody v. Conly, 27 Gratt. 313. But with that thought before her, it was natural to an uneducated mind to express the general contingency of death in the concrete form in which just then it was presented to her imagination. She was thinking of the possibility of death or she would not have made a will. But that possibility at that moment took the specific shape of not returning from her journey, and so she wrote 'if I do not return,' before giving her last commands. We need not consider whether, if the will had nothing to qualify these words, it would be impossible to get away from the condition. But the two gifts are both of a kind that indicates an abiding and unconditioned intent,-one to a church, the other to a person whom she called her adopted son. The unlikelihood of such a condition being attached to such gifts may be considered. Skipwith v. Cabell, 19 Gratt. 758, 783. And then she goes on to say that all that \n\n[193 U.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n she has is her own hard earnings and that she proposes to leave it to whom she pleases. This last sentence of self-justification evidently is correlated to and imports an unqualified disposition of property; not a disposition having reference to a special state of facts by which alone it is justified and to which it is confined. If her failure to return from the journey had been the condition of her bounty,-an hypothesis which is to the last degree improbable in the absence of explanation,-it is not to be believed that when she came to explain her will she would not have explained it with reference to the extraordinary contingency upon which she made it depend instead of going on to give a reason which, on the face of it, has reference to an unconditioned gift.\n\n It is to be noticed that in the leading case cited for the opposite conclusion from that which we reach (Parsons v. Lanoe), Lord Hardwicke emphasizes the proposition that under the circumstances of that case no court of equity would give any latitude to support such a will. There the will began 'in case I should die before I return from the journey I intend, God willing, shortly to undertake for Ireland.' The testator then was married but had no children. He afterwards returned from Ireland and had several children. If the will stood, the children would be disinherited; and that was the circumstance which led the Lord Chancellor to say what we have mentioned, and to add that courts would take hold of any words they could to make the will conditional and contingent. Ambler, 561; 1 Ves. Sr. 192. It is to be noticed further that in the more important of the other cases relied on by the appellees the language or circumstances confirmed the absoluteness of the condition. For instance, 'my wish, desire, and intention now is that if I should not return (which I will, no preventing Providence'). Todd's Will, 2 Watts. & S. 145. There the language in the clearest way showed the alternative of returning to have been present to the testator's mind when the condition was written, and the will was limited further by the word 'now.' Somewhat similar was \n\n[193 U.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n Porter's Goods, L. R. 2 Prob. & Div. 22, where Lord Penzance said, if we correctly understand him, that if the only words adverse to the will had been 'should anything unfortunately happen to me while abroad,' he would not have held the will conditional. See Mayd's Goods, L. R. 6 Prob. Div. 17, 19.\n On the other hand, we may cite the following cases as strongly favoring the view which we adopt. It hardly is worth while to state them at length, as each case must stand so much on its own circumstances and words. The latest English decisions which we have seen qualify the tendency of some of the earlier ones. Mayd's Goods, L. R. 6 Prob. Div. 17; Dobson's Goods, L. R. 1 Prob. & Div. 88; Thorne's Goods, 4 Swabey & T. 36; Likefield v. Likefield, 82 Ky. 589, 56 Am. Rep. 908; Bradford v. Bradford, 4 Ky. L. Rep. 947; Skipwith v.

HORSESHOE MIN & MILL CO(1904)\nNo. 220\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The plaintiffs in error, being the administrator, together with the heirs at law of Rufus Wilsey, deceased, commenced this suit in the state court of South Dakota against the defendants, and upon the trial the complaint was dismissed upon the merits; that judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and the plaintiffs have brought the case here. The action was commenced to obtain a decree that defendants held in trust for the plaintiffs in error an undivided one-half interest in and to the land embraced in what is called in the complaint the Golden Sand lode mining claim, and plaintiffs asked for a decree that the defendants should convey to the plaintiff in \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 249]\n\u00a0\n error, Elder, administrator, an undivided one-half interest therein, and for such other and further relief as might be just and equitable.\n The answer contained a denial of the various allegations of the complaint and set up a defense of laches on the part of the plaintiffs in error in asserting their claim. The case went to trial before the court, and the following facts were found:\n In January, 1878, Rufus Wilsey and Charles H. Havens located a mining claim near Bald mountain, in the Whitewood mining district, Lawrence county, South Dakota, by discovering mineral-bearing rock in place, sinking a shaft, posting discovery notices, and planting boundary stakes; and on May 13 of the same year they filed for record their location certificate, which was then recorded. On June 12, 1878, Wilsey died, and soon thereafter the plaintiffs, his heirs at law, were informed of his death. They knew that he had left property, and from a time shortly after his death corresponded with different attorneys and others residing in the Black hills, trying to get something out of the estate; but, until the arrangement was made with the attorneys under which this action is brought, made no progress towards a settlement. From the time of the death of Wilsey, in 1878, up to December, 1893, the heirs of Wilsey did nothing towards contributing or offering to contribute towards paying for the annual labor made necessary by the Federal statute (Rev. Stat.  2324, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1426) in order to keep possession of the mine. On June 19, 1878, one Evans was appointed special administrator of the estate of Wilsey, and his letters were subsequently revoked, and one Stevens was appointed and filed his bond as administrator on August 13, 1881. Subsequently, on an allegation of the death of Stevens, some time in 1888, the present administrator was appointed on the 12th of August, 1893\n\n\n In 1889, or soon thereafter, processes for the successful treatment of all mining ores, including such ore as was found in the ground in controversy, were introduced in Lawrence county, and as a consequence the value of the mining property \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 250]\n\u00a0\n therein was materially enhanced, and this property became of much greater value in August, 1892, and December, 1893, than at any time since its location.\n On December 5, 1893, the plaintiffs in error, by their attorneys, served on the defendant company an offer in writing to pay $700 for annual development and assessment work, and if that was not the correct amount of the expense for protecting their half interest in the Golden Sand lode, then they offered to pay the full amount due for the protection of the half interest of the plaintiffs in error, and they asked for a receipt, and demanded a deed for such half interest. The offer and the request were refused, and this action was begun on December 6, 1893.\n From the time of the location of the mine up to 1888, inclusive, Havens, the co-owner with Wilsey, did at least $00 worth of labor each year in order to hold the claim, and filed on January 2, 1889, an affidavit to that effect, including the time from 1880 to and including the year 1887, and another affidavit to the same effect for the year 1888. Under the statute he published a notice directed to 'Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators, and to all whom it may concern,' informing them that he had expended $800 in labor upon the mine for the years ending December 31, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, and 1887, and stating that if, within ninety days after this notice by publication, they failed to contribute their proportion, $400, being $50 for each of said years, their interest in said claim would become the property of the subscriber under  2324 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Havens also published for the year 1888 a notice similar to the one already given in regard to the work done prior to that year. The two notices were published in the proper newspaper and were set out in full and published in each daily issue of the paper (every day in the week except Sunday), beginning Monday, January 7, 1889, and concluding Tuesday, April 2, 1889, and no more. Havens also continued, during the years 1889, 1890, 1891, and 1892, to do at least $100 worth of work in the mine for the purpose of holding the same. On \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n August 10, 1892, Havens made a deed of the whole lode and mining claim to one Thomas H. White, and on August 25, 1892, White caused to be filed for record an affidavit of Havens, which recited that he was one of the locators of the Golden Sand lode, and that Wilsey, his co-owner, and whom he advertised out for not contributing his proportion of labor, had not paid his proportion nor any of the expenditures for holding the claim.\n Questions were made as to the sufficiency of the notices and as to the regularity of the publication of the same under the above statute of the United States. The case was tried once before and resulted in a judgment for plaintiffs, which was reversed by the supreme court of the state (9 S. D. 636, 70 N. W. 1060), and upon the new trial the judgment was for the defendants. 15 S. D. 124, 87 N. W. 586.\nMessrs. Eben W. Martin and Norman T. Mason for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chambers Kellar and Messrs. Moody, Kellar, & Moody for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the above statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Federal questions which arise in this case are based upon the statute of the United States already referred to in the foregoing statement of facts, being  2324 of the Revised Statutes, the material portion of which is set forth in the margin. \n The plaintiffs in error contend that the notices published by or in behalf of the defendants in error were not a compliance with the statute, because of the manner in which they were addressed. They also insist that, even assuming the sufficiency of the notices, they were not published in accordance with the \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n requirements of the statute for a sufficient length of time, and that, therefore, the title of the plaintiffs in error was not devested. We are not impressed with the validity of either of the two objections.\n As to the first. The notice was addressed as follows: 'To Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators, and to all whom it may concern.' The objection made is that at the time when this notice was published, Rufus Wilsey was dead, and there was no administrator then existing, and the names of the heirs were not given, and the notice, 'to whom it may concern,' was futile.\n The statute, it will be observed, does not require that the published notice in regard to a deceased co-owner shall be directed to anyone by name. Upon the failure of a co-owner to contribute his proportion of the expenditure required under the section, the co-owner who has performed the labor or made the improvements may, as provided for by the section at the expiration of the year, give such delinquent co-owner personal notice in writing or notice by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim, and if, at the expiration of ninety days after such notice in writing, or by publication, the delinquent refuses to contribute his proportion or fails to do so, his interest in the claim thereby becomes the property of his co-owners who have made the required expenditures. We perceive no possible harm arising from the fact that the notice itself, containing all the facts necessary to be included therein, was addressed to 'Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators, and to whom it may concern.' The fact that Rufus Wilsey was dead was not material so far as to thereby render the notice to his heirs illegel or insufficient. It certainly did them no harm to include the name of Rufus Wilsey, and the notice was quite as likely to become known to them as if it had been addressed 'to the heirs of Rufus Wilsey, deceased, his administrators, and to all whom it may concern.' It is entirely unlike the publication of a summons for the purpose of commencing an action against a particular individual or individuals. There the identification must be complete and the person particularly de- \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n scribed and named, so that when the publication has been finished it can be known that the particular individual has been served with process by publication with the same effect as if it had been personally served on the same individual without publication. This statute provides a summary method for the purpose of insuring the proper contribution of co-owners among themselves in the working of the mine, and it provides a means by which a delinquent co-owner may be compelled to contibute his share, under the penalty of losing his right and title in the property because of such failure. It was not necessary, in our judgment, that the notice should specifically name the heirs of the deceased owner. The act does not require it. If the notice be such that the former owner is particularly named and identified thereby, and his heirs are notified by the publication, it is a sufficient notice to them for the purpose of making it necessary for them to comply with the terms of the statute within the time designated therein by the payment of their share of the expenses of working the mine, or else to loss their right, title, and interest therein. The co-owner who did the work might not know who the heirs were, and it might be impossible for him to learn their names or whereabouts, and the statute never contemplated that the man who did the work should be prevented from obtaining the benefit of the statute by his inability to learn who the heirs were and where they lived. A general address to the heirs of the person named, and the proper publication of the notice, is sufficient. It did not become insufficient because, in addition to being addressed to them, it was also addressed to their intestate by name. An address to a deceased person did them no harm, so long as it was also addressed to them.\n The supreme court of South Dakota has held in this case that at the time this notice was published the title to a one-half interest in this claim was in the heirs, subject to a possible lien of the administrator for administration purposes, and had been since the death of Wilsey. 9 S. D. 636, 642, 70 N. W. 1060. The same court has held that an administrator has but a lien on real \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 256]\n\u00a0\n estate for administrative purposes, and that the title vests in the heirs. ( Cases cited in opinion of the state court.) The only debt, so far as the record shows, existing against the estate of Wilsey, was one for $50, in favor of Stevens, who was appointed administrator in 1881, and died in 1888, and from then until 1893 there was no administrator, the present one being appointed evidently for the purpose of this suit. The actual title to the fee is in the government (Black v. Elkhorn Min, Co. \n163 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 41 S. L. ed. 221, 223, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1101), but the interest of the miner may be conveyed and inherited. (Id. Id.) We are of opinion that the publication of the notice was sufficient, although there was no administrator at the time of publication. It is unnecessary under this statute to publish a notice to lienors. We agree with the supreme court of the state that the evident purpose and object of the law of 1872 ( 2324) were to encourage the exploration and development of the mineral lands of the United States, and the sale of the same, and that, all the provisions of the law having been framed with that object in view, if the required work is not performed, after the expiration of the year, and notice of contribution properly served or sufficiently published, the rights of delinquents are absolutely cut off, though the failure to do the work may have been caused by the death of the locator or locators during the year. When a notice has been rightfully published under the statute it becomes effective in cutting off the claims of all parties, and the title is thus kept clear and free from uncertainty and doubt.\n There was no irregularity in grouping in one notice claims for more than one year's expenditures. We can perceive no reason why a consolidation of the claims of several years should not be made and included in one and the same notice.\n (2.) The objection to the sufficiency of the publication of the notice we regard as equally unfounded. The statute provides for a publication 'for at least once a week for ninety days.' The publication was in fact made every day, except Sunday, in the proper newspaper, beginning Monday, January 7, 1889, \n\n[194 U.S. 248, 257]\n\u00a0\n and concluding Tuesday, April 2, 1889. And the statute provides that if, after the expiration of ninety days after such notice in writing or publication, such delinquent should fail or refuse to contribute his proportion of the expenditure required by this section, his interest in the claim shall become the property of his coowners who have made the required expenditures. The publication, we think, was sufficient. The ninety-day period begins with the first publication; in this case, Monday, January 7. The publication on that day was sufficient for the week then beginning. The publication on January 15, was sufficient for that week, and, as stated by the supreme court of South Dakota: 'Each succeeding Monday would certainly constitute at least one publication each week while so continued. There was a publication on each Monday from January 7 to April 1, both inclusive. If no publication was required after the first until the following Monday, none was required after April 1 until the following Monday, April 8, and on that day the period of ninety days had been completed. Including the first day of publication, ninety days ended on Saturday, April 6. Excluding the first day, ninety days ended on Sunday, April 7. On that day the required notice had continued during ninety days, and another publication on Monday, April 8, was wholly unnecessary.'\n We are satisfied that this construction is the correct one, and the publication was, therefore, made for a sufficient length of time to comply with the statute.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Rev. Stat.  2324; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1426.\n On each claim located after the tenth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and until a patent has been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made each year. On all claims located prior to the tenth of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, ten dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made by the tenth day of June, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and each year thereafter, for each one hundred feet in length along the vein until a patent has been issued therefor; but where such claims are held in common, such expenditure may be made upon any one claim; and upon a failure to comply with these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made, provided that the original locators, their heirs, assigns, or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after failure, and before such location.

A reconsideration of the decision was requested and denied. A petition for an appeal to the board of examiners-in-chief was filed. The primary examiner refused to allow the appeal. A petition was then presented to the Commissioner of Patents praying that he make such order or take such action that petitioner's appeal to the examiners-in-chief might be heard, or, if that prayer be denied, that the Commissioner himself 'consider the various matters all and severally raised by the appeal.' Both prayers were denied and petitioner appealed to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. That court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.

In this court other items of the award were disallowed, and a decree was made reversing the decree below, and remanding the case 'with directions to enter a decree confirming the award for and up to the sum of $193,204.02.' The circuit court thereupon entered a decree for that sum, with interest from the above-mentioned date. The giving of interest is the error alleged; and it is contended that, by the proper construction of the decree of this court, interest should not have been allowed.\n Of course, the only question open in this proceeding is whether the decree of this court prohibits the allowance of interest. Re Sanford Fork & Tool Co. \n160 U.S. 247\n, 40 L. ed. 414, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291. As to that it is to be noticed that nothing is said upon the subject, either in the decree or in the discussion of the case. In the opinion, however, the items were treated as separate matters, 'some of which,' it was said, 'may be disallowed without affecting the rest.' The only ground suggested for reversal was the inclusion of the separable items. By confirming the award as to the others, this court, in effect, declared that they should have been paid in gold coin of the United States of America, in the city of New York, on January 26, 1898, in accordance with the terms of the award. To that extent that decree below stood approved; and as no disapproval was expressed of the consequence attached by that decree to the failure to pay, it is impossible to say that there was any implied prohibition of again attaching the same consequence in the new decree. 'The mandate and the opinion, taken together, although they used the word 'reversed,' amount to a reversal only in respect of the accounting, and to a modification of the decree in respect of the accounting, and to an affirmance of it in all other respects.'

Art. 10. See art. 9. This language authorized the allowance of interest; and the first draft of the award gave interest at 6 per cent in case of failure to pay at the time fixed, allowing, on the other hand, a discount of 5 per cent for cash. Both of these provisions were omitted from the final award, which stopped with fixing the time. But when the Republic submitted itself to the courts, it must be taken to have done so on the same terms as other litigants, so far as fixing the amount which it was to pay was concerned; that being the matter on which the action of the courts was invoked, it seems to us that it was competent for the circuit court to decree the payment of interest as in an ordinary case.\n Rule discharged.

Geake for appellee.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the United States circuit court dismissing the plaintiff's bill and supplemental bills. The bill was brought by the president of the American Express Company, a joint stock company of New York, on behalf of himself and the other members of the company, to enjoin the auditor of the state of Indiana from certifying an assessment for 1898 to the auditor of the several counties of the state. \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n Supplemental bills sought the like remedy in respect of the assessments for the following years through 1901. The ground of relief is that the assessments will result in unconstitutional interferences with commerce among the states and also are contrary to the 14th Amendment. The plaintiff's case may be stated in a few words. The American Express Company is engaged in commerce among the states, including Indiana. It has real estate of a market value of nearly two million dollars, which is outside of Indiana, and which it says is not used in its business, and fifteen million and a half dollars' worth of personal property in New York, as to which it says the same; over three million dollars' worth of real estate used in connection with the business, and about a million and a half dollars' worth of personal property used in the business, of which there was less than eight thousand dollars' worth in Indiana. It has paid the local taxes on this last. The total value of the property for 1898 was $ 22,059,055.35. The market value of what, for brevity, we may call its stock, was $21,600,000. The state board of tax commissioners has undertaken to tax the property of the company under the law which was upheld in American Exp. Co. v. Indiana, \n165 U.S. 255\n, 41 L. ed. 707, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 991; Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 U.S. 194\n, 41 L. ed. 683, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, \n166 U.S. 185\n; 41 L. ed. 965, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604; Adams Exp. Co. v. Kentucky, \n166 U.S. 171\n, 41 L. ed. 960, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527, by treating the whole business as a unit and assessing the company on a proportion of the total value of its property, determined by the ratio of the mileage in Indiana to the total mileage of the company, excluding its ocean mileage for foreign express business, which the company says should have been included. The company relies on the fact that it made a return to the board, setting forth in detail what its property was, where it was situated, and how used, and that the value and nature of the property was not disputed; and it contends that when these facts appeared the board was not at liberty to spread the whole value over the whole line equally, and tax by mileage. The auditor in his answer sets up that the said sum of fifteen and a half million dollars in securities is used by \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n the company as a part of the necessary capital of its business, and denies that the board assesses personal property not used in connection with its business. Thus, he admits, by implication, that the above sum did enter into the assessment made, and this would be obvious unless we should assume the intended tax to be wholly arbitrary, as the assessment was at the rate of $450 a mile for 1,798 and a fraction miles, amounting to $809, 253, as against less than eight thousand dollars' worth of tangible property in the state. There are some differences of detail between the state and the company as to the precise value of the stock, etc. But the foregoing facts present the general question.\n The contention of the company in its extreme form is that the state had no right to tax it anything for the years when its stock was of less market value than its property, because that ratio showed that the whole value of the company was in its tangible assets, and that the intangible property spoken of in the Adams Express Company Case was nothing. It says that in any year that property was so small as to warrant only a nominal tax. We lay this contention on one side. It was admitted at the hearing before the board of tax commissioners that an appreciable sum properly might be assessed on the mileage basis, and therefore the board was warranted in assuming the fact. It was admitted at the argument before this court that the low market value of the stock was due in part to the ignorance of the public as to the assets of the company. On this concession the market value of the stock was not a test of the value of the business. The statement is confirmed by the continued rise in the stock since, up to $225 in April, 1902. And apart from these admissions the board well might have hesitated to believe that the company was carrying on a business, which it gave no signs of intending to stop, at a loss, and was paying its regular dividends out of investments alone. We lay on one side also the question of ocean mileage. Without dwelling on the sudden change in the returns, which added \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n nearly 130,000 miles in 1898, with comparatively slight explanation, or the admitted differences between the ocean and land carriage, we cannot say that the tribunal, having the duty and sole jurisdiction to find the facts, exceeded its powers in not allowing the item.\n We come, then, to the real question of the case: whether, the tax provided for by the statute being a tax on property, it sufficiently appears that the board took into account property which it had no right to take into account in fixing the assessment at the large sum which we have mentioned. We already have stated reasons for assuming that the personal property in New York did enter into the valuation. We may add that it appears by a stipulation as to facts, that 'the minutes of said state board of tax commissioners' are in evidence. This means the complete minutes. It must be assumed that the minutes show all that took place in the proceedings, and therefore that we have before us all the evidence that was put in as well as a report of what was said. There was no indication of dispute concerning the amount, value, and place of the company's personal property. The protests of the company alleged that there was no dispute as to the facts. If the company had been mistaken common fairness required that it should be informed and allowed to give further evidence of the undoubted truth. The ground taken before the board, and insisted on in argument before us, was that the property ought to enter into the valuation, because, wherever situated, it was used in the business; if not otherwise, at least as giving the credit necessary for carrying the business on. We shall assume that the question before us is narrowed to whether that ground can be maintained. The pleadings and proceedings leave no alternative open, and no other could be pressed consistently with the candor to be expected from the officers of a state, in face of a constitutional question and dealing with great affairs. For present purposes it does not matter whether the sum taken for division on a mileage proportion was reached by taking the value of the stock or the value of the tangible \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n assets of the company. For if the former was the starting point it appears from what we have said that the tangible assets gave the stock its value. The use of the value either of total stock or total assets is only as a means of getting at the true cash value of property within the state. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 27 S.; 41 L. ed. 49, 58, 59, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1054; Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 25\n, 35 S. L. ed. 613, 617, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 595, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876.\n The general principles to be applied are settled. A state cannot tax the privilege of carrying on commerce among the states. Neither can it tax property outside of its jurisdiction belonging to persons domiciled elsewhere. On the other hand, it can tax property permanently within its jurisdiction although belonging to persons domiciled elsewhere and used in commerce among the states. And when that property is part of a system and has its actual uses only in connection with other parts of the system, that fact may be considered by the state in taxing, even though the other parts of the system are outside of the state. The sleepers and rails of a railroad, or the posts and wires of a telegraph company, are worth more than the prepared wood and the bars of steel or coils of wire, from their organic connection with other rails or wires and the rest of the apparatus of a working whole. This being clear, it is held reasonable and constitutional to get at the worth of such a line, in the absence of anything more special, by a mileage proportion. The tax is a tax on property, not on the privilege of doing the business, but it is intended to reach the intangible value due to what we have called the organic relation of the property in the state to the whole system. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 22 S., 41 L. ed. 49, 57, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1054. And this principle, established by many cases, has been extended by the cases first cited above to the lines of express companies, although those lines are not material lines upon the face of the earth. There is the same organic connection as in the other cases.\n It is obvious, however, that this notion of organic unity may be made a means of unlawfully taxing the privilege, or prop- \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 500]\n\u00a0\n erty outside the state, under the name of enhanced value or good will, if it is not closely confined to its true meaning. So long as it fairly may be assumed that the different parts of a line are about equal in value, a division by mileage is justifiable. But it is recognized in the cases that if, for instance, a railroad company had terminals in one state equal in value to all the rest of the line through another, the latter state could not make use of the unity of the road to equalize the value of every mile. That would be taxing property outside of the state under a pretense. Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 421\n, 431; 38 L. ed. 1031, 1038, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1114; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 41 S. L. ed. 49, 57, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1054. The same principle applies to personal property which the state would not have the right to tax directly. Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 227\n, 41 S. L. ed. 683, 697, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, \n166 \nU.S. 185, 222\n, 223 S., 41 L. ed. 965, 978, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604. In Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus there was reason to suspect an infraction of constitutional rights, but the secretary of state testified that there was no assessment of property outside the state (\n154 U.S. 434\n, 38 L. ed. 1039, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1114), and therefore the court could not say that there was more than a possible overvaluation by the board. Of course, if the board did not go beyond its jurisdiction, its decision was final. But the court recognized that if the facts charged had appeared the case would have been different. In the Express Companies' Cases previously decided, it was pointed out that there was nothing to show that the lien might not fairly be assumed to be of substantially the same value throughout. But it was intimated on the pages just cited that if the companies should prove the fact to be otherwise a different rule would apply, and the statutes were construed not to prevent such a difference from being taken into account.\n We come back to the question whether the taking of personal property outside the state into the assessment can be justified on the ground that it gives credit necessary for the business in the state. The testimony was that the property was not necessary for that purpose, and, in fact, was not used. We may \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 501]\n\u00a0\n assume that the board was of a different opinion, so far as that was concerned, and still we may hold its action unjustified. It will be seen that we are dealing with much more attenuated relations than when there is a physical line of rails or wires to be valued, every mile of which is a necessary condition of the use of the rest of the lines beyond, and therefore a reflex condition of the value of the line behind it. The case is stronger even than one of terminals having a large value as real estate independent of their use to the road. The express business added nothing to the value of the bonds in New York. Conversely, the utmost extent to which those bonds entered into the value of property in Indiana was in so far as they helped to make the public believe that the express company could be trusted, and therefore increased its good will. That they made a part of the public more willing to buy interests in the company because they were an assurance against personal liability was no concern of Indiana. But it is obvious that, merely from the point of view that the express company could be trusted by the public with the carriage of goods or money, the good will could not be measured by the assets. In the first place, the public knew nothing of the amount. This appears as to even the more instructed portion of the public which bought interests in the concern, and a fortiori as to the general run of shippers. For if even the buyers of the stock of the company would pay only in the neighborhood of the value of the tangible assets, it is apparent either that they did not know what the assets were, as was stated by the appellant's counsel, or else that the good will taxed was worth nothing; and either view is equally fatal to the grounds for the tax.\n But again, suppose that the state of the assets of the company had been published in every newspaper in Indiana, can it be imagined that it would have had an appreciable effect upon the company's business? Certainly it is absurd to say that the business of such companies will bear an exact or any proportion to the stocks and bonds which they may own. Unless we are much mistaken, most people who want to send \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 502]\n\u00a0\n things by express employ a company simply because it is there, and they see its sign is out. The only effect that knowledge of the capital of the company could have would be to produce the conviction that the company was safe to employ. Assume that something is to be added to the good will of a company because it is safe, and that the good will, or a part of it, of the express business in Indiana may be considered in assessing its property there, this is very different from measuring the good will by the capital, when the facts appear as they do in this case. The difference is not a mere difference in valuation, it is a difference in principle, and in our opinion the principle adopted by the board was wrong. It involved an attempt to tax property beyond the jurisdiction of the state, and to throw an unconstitutional burden on commerce among the states. The result has been that, taking the value of the stock as stated by the defendant to have been 125 for 1898, the state of Indiana assessed the company for nearly twice the total good will of its business, measuring that good will by the difference between the tangible assets and the total value of the stock. The injustice grew less flagrant as the stock rose, but in the year 1901 the assessment still was nearly double what the state had a right to assess, assuming that, without transcending its constitutional power, it had a right to assess its proportion by mileage of the total good will.\n We have explained why, in our opinion, this cannot fairly be treated as a mere case of overvaluation, but is an assessment made upon unconstitutional principles. Under such circumstances it was impossible for the company to tender any sum, because it was impossible for it to say what, if anything, it ought to pay. It denied that under the Constitution it ought to pay anything, and it is plain that for the year 1898, at least, it properly could have been assessed but a comparatively trifling sum. The contention of the company was serious and plausible. It made the only offer it could, which was to give security for the payment of whatever amount should be adjudged to be due. 'If there was no right to assess the particular thing at \n\n[193 U.S. 490, 503]\n\u00a0\n all, . . . an assessment under such circumstances would be void, and, of course, no payment or tender of any amount would be necessary before seeking an injunction.'

RITCH(1904)\nNo. 157\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n The controlling question in these cases arises on pleas of res judicata. The essential facts are as follows:\n On October 6, 1884, Daniel B. Fayerweather, a citizen and resident of the state of New York, made a will, by the 9th article of which he gave to twenty colleges bequests amounting in the aggregate to $2,100,000. By the 10th article he gave the residuary estate to his executors, as trustees, directing them to divide it equally among the twenty colleges named in the 9th article. On the same day he signed the following statement:\n'This certifies that I have executed my will of this date, having been advised by my counsel of the provision and restrictions of the law of this state relative to benevolent corporations. I trust my heirs will permit the provision of this my will to be carried into effect.'\n\n At that time, by chap. 360, Laws of 1860, of the state of New York, a testator having husband, wife, child, or parent was forbidden to give to literary or benevolent institutions more than one half of his estate. On December 13, 1884, the testator made a first codicil to his will, by which he revoked the 10th article, and gave the residuary of his estate absolutely to his executors. In other respects the will was ratified. At or about the same time a paper, bearing date December 11, 1884, headed 'Private Memorandum,' was signed by him, which reads as follows:\n'I have made Messrs. Bulkley and Ritch my residuary legatees in the confidence that thereby my intentions as expressed in my will shall be carried into effect, and without \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n litigations on the part of any person or persons interested. In case of my death, I trust that they will take such steps, by will or otherwise, as will protect my estate against the contingency of the death of either before my estate is settled and distributed.'\n\n By subsequent codicils minor changes were made, and Henry B. Vaughan was added as executor. The testator died on November 15, 1890, leaving a widow and three nieces, his only heirs at law and next of kin. On the day of his death he executed a codicil, which was mainly a confirmation of the provisions of the will and prior codicils.\n Mr. Fayerweather's estate amounted at the date of the will to about three millions of dollars, and at the time of his death to from five to six millions of dollars, mainly in personal property.\n While by the articles in the will, prior to the 9th, he had made provision for his widow and also bequests to his three nieces, yet obviously his purpose was to give the bulk of his estate to the several colleges named, and to avoid the restraining effect of the New York statute. After the death of Mr. Fayerweather the will and codicils were propounded for probate, to which the widow and nieces filed objections. A hearing was had before the surrogate, and on February 25, 1891, he entered an order admitting the will to probate, and leaving the contest of the codicils to continue. On February 24, 1891, the three executors, residuary legatees, made a deed of gift, which reads:\n'Know all men by these presents, That we, Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan, residuary devisees and legatees under the will, meaning thereby the original will and the subsequent codicils of Daniel B. Fayerweather, late of the city of New York, deceased, prompted by our determination that we will not retain for our own use any part of the residuary estate left to us by his will, and by the desire to make such disposition of his said residuary estate as in our judgment will best honor his memory, do dispose of so much \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n of the same as shall remain after the payment of all lawful fees, expenses, and charges as follows:\n\n'First, We reserve the power to make, and we retain the right to assent to, any enlargement of the $15,000 a year by the will left to Mrs. Fayerweather, which she may desire.\n\n'Second, We reserve the power to make, and we retain the right to assent to, any enlargement of the provisions made by the will for Mrs. Mary W. Achter and Mrs. Emma S. Drury, in case we shall be satisfied that such enlargement would not be against the wishes of Mr. Fayerweather.\n\n'Third, We give to Lucy J. Beardsley, wife of Morris B. Beardsley, $ 100,000.\n\n'We do this because of Mr. Fayerweather's letter written to Mr. Vaughan and Mr. F. B. Myrick. If accepted, this gift is in discharge of any claim under that letter.'\n\n Then, after making gifts of several sums to individuals, hospitals, and colleges (some being those named in the will of Mr. Fayerweather, and others not so mentioned), the deed closes with these words:\n'We execute this instrument, recognizing that there is pending a contest in proceedings for the probate of Mr. Fayerweather's will, and recognizing further that if such contest shall not prevail, a question may be made about our legal rights as devisees and legatees. . . . Our object is each for himself to give away whatever may come to us as residuary devisees and legatees under Mr. Fayerweather's will.'\n\n Subsequently, and on March 5, the executors, as residuary legatees, entered into an agreement with the contestants by which the amounts coming to them were increased, and thereupon the contestants executed the following paper:\n'In consideration of the instrument of even date herewith executed by Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan, residuary devisees and legatees under the will, meaning thereby the original will and subsequent codicils of Daniel B. Fayerweather, . . . we, the undersigned, being \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n the widow and all of the next of kin of the said Daniel B. Fayerweather, do hereby severally agree for ourselves, our, and each of our heirs, executors, and administrators, as follows:\n\n'1. All objections to the probate of the will and four codicils of the late Daniel B. Fayerweather, offered for probate to the surrogate of the county of New York, are hereby withdrawn, and we consent to the probate of the same.\n\n'2. No suit shall hereafter be brought for the construction of the said will and codicils or either of them, or to set aside the will and codicils or either of them, and we further agree not to make any claim upon the said Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan or either of them, or against their heirs or personal representatives, or either against them, the said Bulkley, Ritch, and Vaughan, as executors, or as residuary legatees, other than for amounts left to us by the will and codicils aforesaid, and the deed of gift executed by the said Bulkley, Ritch, and Vaughan on the 24th day of February, 1891, and the instrument dated on the 5th day of March, 1891\n\n\n\n'3. Upon the payment to the undersigned, respectively, of the several amounts mentioned in said deed of gift and said instrument, we will severally execute a general release of all claims, except those arising under the will and codicils, both to the executors and to the donees mentioned in the deed of gift on the 24th day of February, 1891, and to the said Bulkley, Ritch, and Vaughan individually.'\n\n On March 24, 1891, the codicils were admitted to probate on written consent, signed by the attorneys for the parties to the contest. On June 12, 1891, the widow executed the following release:\n'Know ye, that I, Lucy Fayerweather, widow of Daniel B. Fayerweather, of the city of New York, for and in consideration of the sum of $225,000, lawful money of the United States, to me in hand paid \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n by Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan, as executors and trustees under the last will and testament of Daniel B. Fayerweather, deceased, and individually, and as the representatives of the persons or corporations hereinafter named, forming a class known as donees, under the deed of gift executed by the said Bulkley, Ritch, and Vaughan, on February 24th, 1891, which sum is in compromise and full settlement of any and all contests on my part of the will of said Daniel B. Fayerweather, deceased, or concerning his estate, have remised, released, and forever discharged, and by these presents do, for myself and for my heirs, administrators, and executors, remise, release, and discharge the said Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan, as executors and trustees aforesaid, as individuals and as representatives of the said donees constituting a class, and also the said donees, to wit, the persons and corporations mentioned in a certain deed of gift duly delivered, made by Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch, and Henry B. Vaughan on the 24th day of February, 1891, which deed of gift was introduced in evidence in the probate proceedings of the last will and testament of Daniel B. Fayerweather, deceased, and marked 'Exhibit No. 7, contestants,' and which said deed of gift is hereby made a part of this release, in order that the persons constituting said class of donees and to whom this release runs may be more fully known, and also the legal successors, assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators of all the aforesaid persons and corporations, of and from all and all manner of action and actions, cause and causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, claims and demands whatsoever in law or in equity, which against the said persons or corporations, or any of them, I ever had or now have, or which I or my heirs, executors, or administrators hereinafter shall, can, or may have for, upon, or by reason of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever, except my claim for the annuity given me by the will and codicils thereto of said Daniel B. Fayerweather, deceased, and also my claim for the increased annuityMENTIONED \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n IN THE AGREEMENT DATED MARCH 5Th, 1891, and made pursuant to the dEed of gift above referred to.'\n\n Releases similar in form were executed by the other three contestants, the nieces and next of kin.\n In January, 1893, five of the colleges named in article 9 of the will brought suit in the supreme court of the state of New York against the executors of Mr. Fayerweather's will, the executors of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather (who had died since the release), the nieces, the donees in the deed of gift, and all the colleges not joined as plaintiffs. The contention of the plaintiffs was that the codicil which gave the residue of the estate to the three executors absolutely was made in pursuance of an agreement that they should take that residue in trust for the colleges mentioned in the will, and distribute it among them. The complaint set forth the will and codicils, their admission to probate, and the issue of letters testamentary, and averred that the value of the estate left by the testator was upwards of $6,000,000 and the residuary estate more than $3, 000,000. It alleged that the intention of the testator was to devote the principal part of his estate to the several institutions mentioned, and that the proceedings taken by him were under the advice of counsel and for the purpose of carrying into effect that intention, and upon a promise and assurance from the executors that they would dispose of the residuary estate accordingly; it averred also the fact of a contest in respect to the probate of the will and codicils, a settlement with the contestants in consideration of the payment of $310,000 and the execution of releases by them. The prayer was that it be adjudged and decreed that the residuary estate was devised by the testator and received by the executors in trust for the purposes set forth, that they be required to apply that estate to those purposes, and, also, 'that the ultimate rights of the plaintiffs as between them and each of them and every of the other defendants herein be determined by the judgment in this action in accordance with the allegations of this complaint and the prayer hereinbefore contained.' \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n The donees in the deed of gift answered, asserting the validity of that deed, and praying that its provisions be carried out.\n The widow's executors and the nieces also appeared and filed an answer and counterclaim, in which they alleged that the agreement which the suit was brought to enforce was a secret trust to evade the New York statute by giving more than half to the several institutions, that the releases were obtained from them by concealment and fraud, and therefore of no obligation; and prayed for judgment, among other things--\n'3d. That it be adjudged that the said settlements and releases made with or obtained from the said Lucy Fayerweather, Mary W. Achter, and Emma S. Fayerweather, respectively, were and are each fraudulent and void, and that the same be set aside, upon such terms as may be just and equitable, and that the sums paid for the same to said releasors or their attorneys, respectively, with the interest thereon, including the increased payments to said Lucy Fayerweather on her annuity, be charged against or allowed upon the sums payable to them respectively under the judgment herein, or be otherwise provided or accounted for as may be according to equity.\n\n'4th. That it be adjudged that the said deed of gift, dated February 24th, 1891 (Exhibit F), was and is fraudulent and void, and that the said Thomas G. Ritch, Justus L. Bulkley, and Henry B. Vaughan be enjoined and restrained from further distributing the said residuary estate, or any part thereof, under the same, except to continue the payment of the said annuity to said Anner Amelia Reynolds, as aforesaid.\n\n'5th. That the said defendants Ritch, Bulkley, and Vaughan may be required to account for the moneys and property received by them from the estate of the said Daniel B. Fayerweather under said last will and testament and codicils or otherwise, and for the application thereof, and to pay over the said moneys and property remaining in their hands among the parties to this action according to their several and respective \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n rights thereto, as the same may be adjudged in this action.\n\n'6th. That the ultimate rights of the parties to this action in the estate of the said Daniel B. Fayerweather be determined and enforced by the judgment in this action, in accordance with the allegations of this answer and the foregoing prayers for relief therein.\n\n'7th. That these defendants may have such other and further relief herein as may be just and equitable, with their costs herein, to be paid as the court may direct.'\n\n The decree of the supreme court at special term, entered on December 28, 1894, adjudged and decreed that the residuary estate passed to the executors in trust for the colleges named in the ninth paragraph of the will; that the executors and trustees be restrained and enjoined from distributing the residuary estate, or any part thereof under the deed of gift, and that the plaintiffs and certain of the defendants (including therein the executors of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather and two of the nieces) recover from the trustees their costs, together with extra allowances to be paid out of the trust funds. There was no formal finding of facts and no mention made in the decree of the specific claim of the executors of Mrs. Fayerweather's will and the nieces, that the releases were fraudulently obtained. An appeal was taken by the defendants to the general term of the supreme court, which, on December 18, 1895, affirmed the judgment. A further appeal was taken to the court of appeals, which, on January 19, 1897, affirmed the judgment of the general term. 151 N. Y. 282, 37 L. R. A. 305, 45 N. E. 876. On January 28, 1897, a motion was made in the court of appeals to amend the remittitur so as to direct the justice of the supreme court before whom the action was tried at special term to consider the evidence given before him at the trial concerning the releases, and to determine whether the said releases were valid and binding or invalid and void, which motion was on March 9, 1897; denied.\n After these proceedings in the state court two of the nieces \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 285]\n\u00a0\n and next of kin, being citizens of the state of Iowa, instituted this suit in the circuit court of the United States, making defendants substantially all the parties to the suit in the state court, the one or two omissions in no way affecting the question before us. Subsequently the remaining executor, one having resigned, of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather, filed a cross bill, the allegations and the relief asked being similar to those in the original bill.\n These bills-in addition to setting forth the will and codicils executed by Mr. Fayerweather, the probate proceedings, and the releases by the widow and nieces, and alleging that these letters were fraudulently obtained, and not binding-averred the bringing of the suit hereinbefore referred to in the supreme court of the state by the five colleges, annexing copies of the pleadings, and alleged 'thereupon the issues so joined, as well as others duly raised by the answers of the several defendants, came on to be tried before said court, and these complainants gave evidence tending to prove the allegations in their said answer, and all of the said allegations, and thereupon it became and was the duty of said court to adjudge and determine whether the releases therein described were invalid, and whether these complainants were entitled to the affirmative relief prayed in respect thereto;' and further, that the defendants--\n'Confederating and combining together and between themselves to prevent the entry of any judgment upon an actual determination of the invalidity of said releases so in issue, requested and induced the court to hold and decide that the right of the respective parties to said property and residuary estate did not require any consideration or decision of said issues, and said court thereupon made and rendered its decision without considering, passing upon, or including in judgment the said issues, and omitted to decide upon these complainants' right to the affirmative relief by said answer prayed in respect to said releases.\n\n'And thereupon there was filed and entered in said action \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 286]\n\u00a0\n a decision and judgment, a copy of which is hereto annexed, which complainants pray may be referred to and taken as part of this bill as if the same were herein set forth at length.\n\n'Thereupon, by appeals taken from said judgment, in which appeals these complainants were respondents as well as appellants, said judgment was reviewed by the general term of said supreme court, sitting as a court for the correction of errors, and not exercising any original jurisdiction, and thereupon said court held and determined that the right of the respective parties to said property and residuary estate did require the consideration and decision of said issues, and thereupon, being duly informed by the record that said issues had not been in fact considered, passed upon, or included in said judgment, it became and was the duty of said court, pursuant to due process of law, the law of the land, and the provisions of the Constitutions of the state of New York and of the United States, to require and order that said issues should be in fact considered, passed upon, and included in judgment by the trial court, and until that should be done said court could not duly adjudge or determine whether any error had been committed in such determination upon said issues.\n\n'Nevertheless, said court at said general term did not so require or order, but by various fictions of law imputed to said trial term and court below that it had determined said issues and had decided in favor of the plaintiffs in said action upon such determination, contrary to the truth and fact, and thereupon pretended to adjudge and determine, as such court for the correction of errors, that there was not sufficient preponderance of evidence to support the asserted invalidity of said releases to render such imputed determination of said trial court erroneous as matter of law, but that such imputed determination was supported by evidence sufficient to relieve the same from the assignment of error in so deciding.\n\n'It was not competent for said general term to have exercised an original jurisdiction, and to have adjudged said issues, \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 287]\n\u00a0\n and thereupon to have modified said judgment so as to include the actual determination thereof; and said general term did not exercise such power, but confined its action wholly to the consideration of errors in the record.\n\n'Thereupon said judgment was by appeals taken from the judgment of affirmance so rendered, in which appeals these complainants were respondents as well as appellants, and reviewed by the court of appeals of the state of New York.\n\n'Said court determined that these complainants had no standing to be heard or to have their rights determined by said court of appeals, because the limitations imposed by statute upon the jurisdiction of said court precluded any inquiry into the facts, the proof, or the merits of the said issues, but the said court was bound by the formal record procured as aforesaid, and by the fictions thereby adjudged as aforesaid, and had no power to review the same.\n\n'During the pendency of the appeals aforesaid, the control of the several courts below over said action, and the trial thereof, and the correction of any injustice arising as aforesaid, was suspended, and upon the affirmance of said judgment of affirmance, by the statutes of the state of New York any correction of the injustice arising as aforesaid was placed beyond the power of any court of said state, except as the court of appeals should, by its remittitur, confer power upon said subordinate courts to entertain and try the said issues.\n\n'Thereupon these complainants duly made application to said court of appeals so to frame its said remittitur as to permit said subordinate courts to entertain and try the said issues, which application said court denied.'\n\n To these bills the defendants filed pleas of res judicata, claiming that the controversy between the parties was finally settled by the decision of the state court. These pleas were accompanied by an answer, denying the allegations of fraud. The circuit court sustained the pleas, and dismissed the bill and cross bill on the ground that the cause of action set forth \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 288]\n\u00a0\n in them was barred by the prior judgment of the state court. From this decree of dismissal the plaintiffs appealed directly to this court.\n Messrs. Roger M. Sherman and William Blaikie for appellants.\n Mr. Charles Andrews for the widow and next of kin, upon the question of res judicata.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 276, 291]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Elihu Root, James L. Bishop, John E. Parsons, C. N. Bovee, Jr ., Thomas H. Hubbard, William Forse Scott, William Ford Upson, John McL. Nash, Stewart L. Woodford, Horace Russell, Henry L. Stimson, Alfred W. Kiddle, Seth Sprague Terry, George G. Reynolds, Henry B. Twombly, Haley Fiske, Henry Stoddard, for appellees.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 276, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Our jurisdiction of this direct appeal from the decision of the circuit court is invoked on the ground that the case involves the application of the Constitution of the United States.\n The contention is that, by article 5 of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution, no person can 'be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;' that these plaintiffs were entitled to large shares of the estate of Daniel B. Fayerweather; that they were deprived of this property by the judgment of the circuit court, which gave unwarranted effect to a judgment of the state courts; that this action of the circuit court is not to be considered a mere error in the progress of a trial, but a deprivation of property under the forms of legal procedure. In Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, we held that a judgment of a state court might be here reviewed if it operated to deprive a party of his property without due process of law, and that the fact that the parties were properly brought into court and admitted to make defense was not absolutely conclusive upon the question of due process. We said (p. 234, L. ed. p. 983, Sup. Ct. Rep. 584):\n'But a state may not, by any of its agencies, disregard the prohibitions of the 14th Amendment. Its judicial authorities may keep within the letter of the statute prescribing forms of procedure in the courts, and give the parties interested the fullest opportunity to be heard, and yet it might be that its final action would be inconsistent with that amendment. In determining what is due process of law, regard must be had to substance, not to form. This court, referring to the 14th Amendment, has said: 'Can a state make anything due process of law which, by its own legislation, it chooses to declare such? To affirm this is to hold that the prohibition to the states is of no avail, or has no application where the invasion of private rights is effected under the forms of state legislation.' Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 102\n, 24 S. L. ed. 616, 618. The \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 298]\n\u00a0\n same question could be propounded, and the same answer should be made, in reference to judicial proceedings inconsistent with the requirement of due process of law. If compensation for private property taken for public use is an essential element of due process of law as ordained by the 14th Amendment, then the final judgment of a state court, under the authority of which the property is in fact taken, is to be deemed the act of the state within the meaning of that amendment.'\n\n And again (p. 236, 237, L. ed. p. 985, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 584):\n'The mere form of the proceeding instituted against the owner, even if he be admitted to defend, cannot convert the process used into due process of law, if the necessary result be to deprive him of his property without compensation.'\n\n If a judgment of a state court can be reviewed by this court on error upon the ground that, although the forms of law were observed, it necessarily operated to wrongfully deprive a party of his property (as indicated by the decision just referred to), a judgment of the circuit court of the United States, claimed to give such unwarranted effect to a decision of a state court as to accomplish the same result, may also be considered as presenting the question how far it can be sustained in the view of the prohibitory language of the 5th Amendment, and thus involve the application of the Constitution. It is said that the right of these plaintiffs to share in the estate of Daniel B. Fayerweather is undoubted, unless destroyed by the releases they executed; that the fundamental question presented in the trial court of the state was the validity of those releases; that, notwithstanding this, that court came to its conclusion and rendered its judgment without any determination thereof; that the appellate courts wrongfully assumed that the trial court had decided the question, and rendered their judgments on that assumption, so that the necessary result of the proceedings in the state courts was a deprivation of the right of the plaintiffs to a share of the estate, without any finding of the vital fact which alone could destroy their right. The \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 299]\n\u00a0\n contention is not that the state courts erred in their finding in respect to this fact, but that there never was any finding. Such decision of the state courts, made without any finding of the fundamental fact, was accepted in the circuit court of the United States as a conclusive determination of the fact. Although these plaintiffs were parties to the proceedings in the state courts, and presented their claim of right, if it be true that the necessary result of the course of procedure in those courts was a denial of their rights,-a taking away and depriving them of their property without any judicial determination of the fact upon which alone such deprivation could be justified,-a case is presented coming directly within the decision in \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. Giving effect in the circuit court to the state judgment does not change the character of the question. It is simply adding the force of a new determination to one wrongfully obtained, and adding it upon no new facts. Whether the contention of the plaintiffs in respect to the character of the state proceedings can be sustained or not is a question upon the merits, and does not determine the matter of jurisdiction. That depends upon whether there is presented a bona fide and reasonable question of the wrongful character of the proceedings in the state courts, and the necessary result therefrom. We are of opinion that the jurisdiction of this court must be sustained.\n We pass, therefore, to consider the merits of the case. Private right and public welfare unite in demanding that a question once adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction shall, except in direct proceedings to review, be considered as finally settled and conclusive upon the parties. Interest reipublicoe ut sit finis litium. But in order to make this finality rightful it should appear that the question was distinctly put in issue; that the parties presented their evidence, or at least had an opportunity to present it, and that the question was decided. Cases of an alleged prior adjudication have frequently been presented in this court and the scope of a plea thereof fully determined. In the leading \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 300]\n\u00a0\n case of Cromwell v. Sae County, \n94 \nU.S. 351, 352\n, 24 S. L. ed. 195, 197, we said:\n'In considering the operation of this judgment, it should be borne in mind, as stated by counsel, that there is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar or estoppel against the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the same parties upon a different claim or cause of action. In the former case, the judgment, if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action. It is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. Thus, for example, a judgment rendered upon a promissory note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the amount due upon it, although it be subsequently alleged that perfect defenses actually existed, of which no proof was offered, such as forgery, want of consideration, or payment. If such defenses were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, the subsequent allegation of their existence is of no legal consequence. The judgment is as conclusive, so far as future proceedings at law are concerned, as though the defenses never existed. The language, therefore, which is so often used, that a judgment estops not only as to every ground of recovery or defense actually presented in the action, but also as to every ground which might have been presented, is strictly accurate, when applied to the demand or claim in controversy. Such demand or claim, having passed into judgment, cannot again be brought into litigation between the parties in proceedings at law upon any ground whatever.'\n\n See also Wilson v. Deen, \n121 U.S. 525\n, 30 L. ed. 980, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1004; Hefner v. Northwestern Mut. L. Ins. Co. \n123 U.S. 747\n, 31 L. ed. 309, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337; Wiggins Ferry Co. v. Ohio & M. R.

Land Co. \n192 U.S. 355\n-358, 48 L. ed. 476-478, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266.\n The state court was one of competent jurisdiction, and the present contestants were before that court, taking part in the litigation. The validity of the releases was put in issue by the pleadings, and no judgment could properly have been rendered without a determination of that question. The colleges sought to enforce a secret trust, but the property covered by the trust, together with that passing under the 9th article of the will, was the bulk of the estate,-far more than half. Such a disposition of the testator's property was in contravention of the laws of New York. They who would take the estate in case of intestacy had a right to object to the enforcement of the trust. Only on condition that they waived their objections and released could it be sustained. The judgment enforced it. It therefore practically determined that the releases were valid, and decided against the contention of these plaintiffs, that they were fraudulent and void. All this is evident from a perusal of the pleadings. The appellants concede this and rest their claim in the Federal court partly upon that basis. Thus, in their brief it is said:\n'The issues so joined came on to be tried in the state supreme court; these complainants gave evidence tending to prove their allegations, and thereupon it became the duty of the court to adjudge whether the releases which they assailed were invalid, and whether they were entitled to the affirmative relief prayed. The issues so tendered were necessary to be determined before any valid judgment upon those issues could be given pursuant to due process of law, the law of the land and the provisions of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The case was tried by the court without a jury. No special \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 302]\n\u00a0\n findings of fact were made. According to testimony given on the trial of this case in the circuit court the omission to make special findings was with the acquiescence (if not at the instance) of all the counsel appearing in the state court. The decree adjudged that the residuary estate was held in trust for the colleges named in the 9th article of the will, enjoined the residuary legatees from distributing any portion of that estate under the deed of gift, and directed that it be paid over to the respective colleges. The ordinary rule in respect to a judgment without any special findings is that it, like a general verdict of a jury, is tantamount to a finding in favor of the successful party of all the facts necessary to sustain the judgment. In the general term, on the appeal taken to it, two opinions were filed,-one by Judge Follett, in which Judge Parker concurred, and one by the presiding judge, Van Brunt. Judge Follett, after stating that the executors of the testator's widow and two of his heirs at law and next of kin sought to have the residuary clause declared invalid, under chap. 360 of the Laws of 1860, said:\n'The difficulty with their contention is that the widow and heirs released all of their interest in the estate for valuable considerations paid to them. . . . It is urged that these releases were procured by fraud and undue influence. There is no evidence in the record justifying this contention. The terms of settlement were agreed on during the controversy in the surrogate's court over the probate of the will and codicils, and the widow and heirs were represented in that controversy, and in the settlement by distinguished counsel, and acted under their advice. . . . If the person entitled to contest a will, or some one or more of its provisions, voluntarily, and for a valuable consideration, received after the testator's death, with full knowledge of the invalidity of the will, devests himself of all interest in the property attempted to be disposed of by it, he cannot impeach its validity.'\n\n Presiding Judge Van Brunt thus stated his conclusions:\n'The testator left him surviving a widow, who was the only \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 303]\n\u00a0\n person who could call into operation, for her protection, the statute which we have quoted. The widow, however, has released to the executors all claims to the estate, which release cannot be successfully attacked or set aside. There is consequently no person for whose benefit he statute can operate.\n\n'No rights of heirs and next of kin have been infringed upon, because the trust does not contravene any statute for their benefit, and is not the subject of attack by them. If it were, they have also executed a release of their interest in the estate in the same manner as the widow.\n\n'We have therefore the case of a trust established, which would be valid as against all the world but for the statute in favor of the widow; and the widow, having released all her rights in the estate, how can her representatives claim the invalidity of a trust as to property in which she had no interest?' [91 Hun, 534, 36 N. Y. Supp. 576.]\n\n The opinion in the court of appeals was delivered by Judge Vann, and concurred in by all the judges except Chief Judge Andrews. In it it is said:\n'Although the decision by the special term and the affirmance by the general term were general in form, necessarily some facts were found by those courts, even if they are not specified in the record. Otherwise the burden of deciding questions of fact would be cast upon this court, which has jurisdiction to decide only questions of law. We think that the effect of a decision by the trial court without expressing the facts found is the same as if there had been a general verdict rendered by a jury, and that the same presumptions arise in its support.\n\n ... * *\n'We are of the opinion, therefore, that where the decision of the special term does not state the facts found, and the judgment entered thereon has been affirmed by the general term, upon an appeal to this court all the facts [alleged in the complaint] warranted by the evidence, and necessary to support the judgments below, are presumed to have been found. Hence, upon such an appeal, we have no more control over the facts than we have \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 304]\n\u00a0\n when specific findings are made by the special term and affirmed by the general term. This conclusion takes the question as to the fraud alleged to have been practised by the residuary legatees upon the widow and next of kin in procuring the releases our of the case, for it cannot be said on the record before us that the evidence tending to show fraud is so irresistible as to make the omission to find fraud an error of law. Assuming that there was evidence enough to warrant the inference of fraud, there was also ample evidence to warrant the inference that there was no fraud. A question of fact was thus presented which is beyond our power of review.' [151 N. Y. 320, 321, 37 L. R. A. 320, 45 N. E. 886.]\n\n Thus the court of appeals held in accord with the ordinary ruling as to the effect of a judgment without findings. So it has frequently decided. In Bartlett v. Goodrich, 153 N. Y. 421, 424, 47 N. E. 794, 795, it said:\n'The learned trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and the general term has affirmed the judgment. There were no findings made as the result of the trial, but simply a brief statement of the ground of the decision. In this condition of the record we must presume that all facts warranted by the evidence, and necessary to support the judgment, have been found. Amherst College v. Ritch, 151 N. Y. 282, 37 L. R. A. 305, 45 N. E. 876. The appeal, therefore, cannot prevail unless it appears, as matter of law, that the learned trial judge was not warranted, upon any fair view of the evidence, in finding as he did, that the deceased was, at the time of his death, the equitable owner of the policies.'\n\n See also New York Security & T. Co. v. Lipman, 157 N. Y. 551, 556, 52 N. E. 595; Garvey v. Long Island R. Co. 159 N. Y. 323, 328, 70 Am. St. Rep. 550, 54 N. E. 57; Reed v. McCord, 160 N. Y. 330, 334, 54 N. E. 737; Solomon v.

E. 633. \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 305]\n\u00a0\n After the filing of its opinion an application made to the court of appeals, as shown in the statement of facts, to amend the remittitur so as to direct the trial court to find specifically whether the releases were valid or not, was denied.\n We have thus the case of a hearing in the trial court upon issues which required a determination of the validity of these releases as a condition of a judgment adverse to these plaintiffs; a judgment against them; an affirmance of the judgment by the general term of the supreme court, with an opinion declaring that there was in the record no evidence justifying the claim that these releases were fraudulently obtained, and void; and a further affirmance by the court of appeals, accompanied by an opinion declaring that, upon the state of the record, it was to be presumed that the validity of the releases had been affirmatively found, and also that there was sufficient evidence to sustain such a finding, followed by a refusal to send the question of the validity of the releases back to the trial court for consideration. Notwithstanding all this, apparent upon the face of the record, the plaintiffs insist that the validity of the releases was never determined by any of the state courts, and that the final judgment of affirmance by the court of appeals was based upon the presumption of a determination which was never in fact made.\n Upon what is this contention based? First, the silence of the judgment, which contains no findings to indicate upon what it is based; second, a memorandum of decision filed by the trial judge, in which he states that 'the grounds upon which the issues have been decided are' a promise of the executors that if made residuary legatees they would distribute the residuary estate among the colleges named in the 9th article, and that the testator made them residuary legatees in reliance upon such promise; the opinion of the trial judge, in which he discusses at some length, and with citation of authorities, the validity of the secret trust and the testimony by which it was established, and then, without in terms passing upon the contention respecting the releases, states 'the \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 306]\n\u00a0\n view that I have taken of the facts and the law of this case renders it unnecessary for me to consider the very interesting questions of law propounded by the learned counsel for the defendants Reynolds, Achter, and Fayerweather;' and, finally, the testimony of the trial judge, given on the hearing in this case some six years after his decision in the state court, to the effect that, in deciding the case he did not consider the question of the validity of the releases.\n It is undoubtedly true that, in some cases, evidence may be introduced outside the record to show what particular question was tried and determined in the former suit. Washington, A. & G. Steam-Packet Co. v. Sickles, 24 How. 333, 344, 16 L. ed. 650, 654, 5 Wall. 580, 592, 18 L. ed. 550, 553; Russell v. Place, \n94 \nU.S. 606, 608\n, 24 S. L. ed. 214, 215. But it does not follow that testimony of every kind is admissible for that purpose. In Washington, A. & G. Steam-Packet Company v. Sickles, although it was held that 'in cases where the record itself does not show that the matter was necessarily and directly found by the jury, evidence aliunde consistent with the record may be received to prove the fact,' yet, it appearing that some of the jurors on the former trial were permitted to testify as to the particular ground upon which they found their verdict, it was said (p. 593, L. ed. p. 554):\n'But it is proper to say that the secret deliberations of the jury or grounds of their proceedings while engaged in making up their verdict are not competent or admissible evidence of the issues or finding. The jurors oftentimes, though they may concur in the result, differ as to the grounds or reasons upon which they arrive at it.\n\n'The evidence should be confined to the points in controversy on the former trial to the testimony given by the parties, and to the questions submitted to the jury for their consideration, and then the record furnishes the only proper proof of the verdict.'\n\n See also Wood v. Jackson, 8 Wend. 9-36, 22 Am. Dec. 603; Lawrence v. Hunt, 10 Wend. 80-85, 25 Am. Dec. 539.\n Tested by the rule thus laid down the testimony of the trial \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 307]\n\u00a0\n judge, given six years after the case had been disposed of, in respect to the matters he considered and passed upon, was obviously incompetent. True, the reasoning of the court for the rule is not wholly applicable, for, as the case was tried before a single judge, there were not two or more minds coming by different processes to the same result. Nevertheless, no testimony should be received except of open and tangible facts,-matters which are susceptible of evidence on both sides. A judgment is a solemn record. Parties have a right to rely upon it. It should not lightly be disturbed, and ought never to be overthrown or limited by the oral testimony of a judge or juror of what he had in mind at the time of the decision. Undoubtedly, when the pleadings are general, as in a case of the common counts, evidence may be given of the testimony which was introduced on the trial, for that may disclose what must have been considered and determined. And where the evidence is that testimony was offered at the prior trial upon several distinct issues, the decision of any one of which would justify the verdict or judgment, then the conclusion must be that the prior decision is not an adjudication upon any particular issue or issues, and the plea of res judicata must fail.\n Putting one side the oral testimony of the trial judge, there is nothing in the other matters specified to disturb the conclusion which follows from an examination of the record, that the validity of the releases was actually determined. Of course, the omission of special findings means nothing, for the judgment implies a finding of all necessary facts. The memorandum of decision naturally states the grounds for arriving at a conclusion concerning the respective claims of the colleges named in the 9th clause and the beneficiaries of the deed of gift, for that was the controversy between those parties, and indeed, the primary controversy presented by the pleadings. The declaration in the opinion, that the conclusion reached upon the matters discussed rendered it unnecessary to consider the questions of law propounded by the counsel for these plaintiffs, must be read in the light of the \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 308]\n\u00a0\n prior statement therein that the widow and next of kin were demanding that the releases executed by them be set aside and they be given the residuary estate, and the further fact that whether the releases were fraudulently obtained and void was a question of fact rather than of law. Evidently the opinion proceeded and the conclusion was reached on the assumption that there was no sufficient testimony to invalidate the releases.\n Further, the entire record of the case was taken on appeal to the general term. That court had before it for consideration all the evidence which was presented to the trial court; and, as we have seen, declared in its opinion that there was no evidence justifying the contention that the releases were procured by fraud and undue influence. While this was not stated in the form of a speciat finding, it discloses the conclusion of the court from the evidence. We cannot hold that it was not authorized to pass upon this question, for its conclusion was sustained by the court of appeals, which, in its opinion, also referred to the question. Finally, by the motion to amend its remittitur, the attention of the court of appeals was specifically called to these very matters which are now urged as showing a failure on the part of the lower courts to determine the question of the validity of the releases, and it refused to make any order which would permit a further consideration. Nothing can be clearer from this record than that the question of the validity of the releases was not only before the state courts, but was considered and determined by them, and the regularity of the procedure was sustained by the highest court of the state. The question was, as affirmed by counsel for these appellants, put in issue by the pleadings, and its determination was a necessary prerequisite to an adverse judgment. It was referred to by all the courts in their opinions, was affirmatively decided by the general term, its decision sustained by the court of appeals, and reaffirmed by that court, by a refusal to amend its remittitur.\n Under these circumstances the pleas of res judicata were \n\n[195 U.S. 276, 309]\n\u00a0\n properly sustained, and the decree of the Circuit Court, dismissing the bill and cross bill, is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE did not hear the argument, and took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIELD v. BARBER ASPHALT PAV CO(1904)\nNo. 201\nArgued: April 11, 1904Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n These cases are appeals from the decree of the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Missouri. \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 619]\n\u00a0\n Richard H. Field, as owner of certain lands abutting on Main street, Baltimore avenue, and Wyandotte street, in Westport, Missouri, which city was then a suburb and has since become a part of Kansas City, filed a bill of complaint against the paving company. The relief sought was against certain tax bills, issued to pay for the paving of the abovenamed streets, held by the defendant company, and to have the same declared void because ( 1) the act under which they were assessed violated the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; (2) that the paving in question was unnecessary, and the contract for the same was the result of undue and illegal influence on the part of the agents of the defendant company, exercised upon the board of aldermen of the city of Westport; (3) that the contracts for the paving required the same to be constructed of Trinidad Lake asphalt, thereby cutting off competition with other kinds of asphalt suitable for street paving; (4) that the proceedings and agreements by which such asphalt was designated in the resolutions, ordinances, and rules for the construction of said pavements were in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States (art. 1,  8); and (5) that the said resolutions, ordinances, and contracts, and the action of the defendant company in securing the same, were in violation of the Federal antitrust act of July 2, 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. 1901, p. 3200].\n Upon the trial, the circuit court held against the prayer of the complainant for relief upon the Federal grounds alleged, but, holding that the paving of Wyandotte street was unnecessary, granted the prayer of the bill as to the tax bills issued for work done on that street, and dismissed the bill as to the other two streets.\n From so much of the decree as held the tax bills for the work done on Wyandotte street invalid the paving company also appealed. (Case No. 202.)\nMr. Richard H. Field in propria persona for appellant and cross appellee. \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 620]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William C. Scarritt, J. K. Griffith, Elliott H. Jones, and Edward L. Scarritt for the Barber Asphalt Paving Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion was filed by the appellant to dismiss the appeal of the paving company, which was postponed to the hearing of these appeals upon the merits. An examination of the motion, and a consideration of the briefs filed and arguments made in support of and in opposition to the same, leads us to the conclusion that it cannot be sustained. The appellant appealed directly to this court; for while there was an allegation of diverse citizenship in the bill, jurisdiction was also invoked on the constitutional grounds above stated. This made the case appealable directly to this court under  5 of the act of March 3, 1891 ([ 26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517] U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), as one which 'involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.'\n The contention is that the prayer of the complainant on the constitutional grounds having been denied, the appeal of the respondent should have been to the circuit court of appeals. But we cannot agree to this view. There was no cross bill filed in the case, and none was required. The bill of complaint contained allegations sufficient to make a case of alleged violation of constitutional rights. It is well settled that in such cases the entire case may be brought to this court by the appeal. In Holder v. Aultman, M. & Co. \n169 U.S. 81\n-88, 42 L. ed. 669-671, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269, discussing the act of March, 1891, Mr. Justice Gray said:\n'Upon such a writ of error, differing in these respects from a writ of error to the highest court of a state, the jurisdiction of this court does not depend upon the question whether the right claimed under the Constitution of the United States has been upheld or denied in the court below; and the jurisdiction of this court is not limited to the constitutional question, but \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 621]\n\u00a0\n includes the whole case.

Columbia Twp. \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174.\n\n See also Chappell v. United States, \n160 U.S. 499\n-509, 40 L. ed. 510- 513, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Horner v. United States, \n143 U.S. 570\n-577, 36 L. ed. 266-269, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522.\n If, therefore, the whole case can come to this court by direct appeal under the allegations of this bill, and if all the questions, Federal or otherwise, may come up on such appeal, it must follow that either party aggrieved by the decision may appeal, and in this case, the complainant appealing, a cross appeal may be sued out by the defendant as to the matters decided in the same case against him. If he fails to take such appeal the correctness of the decision as against him will be presumed. New Orleans & B. S. Mail Co. v. Flanders, 12 Wall. 130, 20 L. ed. 249; Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191-196, 17 L. ed. 839-841.\n The motion to dismiss the cross appeal must be denied.\n Coming to the merits of the case, the grounds of Federal relief will first be considered. It is claimed that certain sections of the act of the general assembly of Missouri, which make the tax bills levied to pay the contract price for the paving, a lien upon the complainant's real estate, deprive him of his property without due process of law, and deny to him the equal protection of the laws. This argument is predicated on  5989 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri.\n The exact point of objection is that the improvement is not to be made if a majority of the resident owners of the property liable to taxation therefor shall file with the city clerk a protest against such improvement, which privilege of protest is not given to nonresident owners, thereby discriminating against them. It is well settled, however, that not every discrimination of this character violates constitutional rights. It is not the purpose of the 14th Amendment, as has been frequently held, to prevent the states from classifying the subjects of legislation, and making different regulations as to the property of different individuals differently situated. The provision of the Federal Constitution is satisfied if all \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 622]\n\u00a0\n persons similarly situated are treated alike in privileges conferred or liabilities imposed. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 U.S. 321\n, 29 L. ed. 414, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 30 L. ed. 578, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 42 L. ed. 1037, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255. The alleged discrimination is certainly not an arbitrary one; the presence within the city of the resident property owners, their direct interest in the subject-matter, and their ability to protest promptly if the means employed are objectionable, place them on a distinct footing from the nonresidents, whom it may be difficult to reach. Furthermore, there is no discrimination among property owners in taxing for the improvement. When the assessment is made it operates upon all alike. It has been held to be within the power of the legislature of Missouri to authorize the council to order the improvement to be made without consulting property owners. Buchan v. Broadwell, 88 Mo. 31. If the legislature saw fit to give to those most directly interested, and whose consent could be most readily obtained, the right to protest, such action did not deprive other persons of rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n Further objection on Federal grounds is urged, in that the specification of Trinidad Lake asphalt for this improvement is in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and of the so-called Sherman act of July, 1890. The right to provide for this paving was vested by the Missouri statute in the board of aldermen. The right to select the material for the paving was vested in that body; they saw fit to choose Trinidad Lake asphalt for the paving. Their right so to do, under the charter powers of such cities as Westport, notwithstanding competitive bidding is thereby rendered impossible, has been sustained by the supreme court of Missouri. Barber Asphalt Pav. Co. v. Hunt, 100 Mo. 22, 8 L. R. A. 110, 18 Am. St. Rep. 530, 13 S. W. 98; Warren v. Barber Asphalt Pav. Co. 115 Mo. 572, 22 S. W. 490; Verdin v. St. Louis, 131 Mo. 26, 33 S. W. 480, 36 S. W. 52. With the wisdom of this choice the courts have nothing to do; and in this case we are only concerned to inquire as to the alleged violation of Federal rights \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 623]\n\u00a0\n in such selection. The argument is that Trinidad Lake asphalt, being a product of a foreign country, and brought into Missouri, and there being other deposits in other states within the United States from which suitable asphalt could be had, the specification of this kind of asphalt is an interference with, and a regulation of, interstate commerce, in violation of the exclusive right of Congress conferred by the Constitution. It is unnecessary to cite largely from cases in this court which hold that only such acts as directly interfere with the freedom of interstate commerce are prohibited to the states. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 U.S. 1\n, 32 L. ed. 346, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6, in which case, Mr. Justice Lamar, speaking for the court, said (p. 23, L. ed. 351, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 237, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 11): 'As has been often said 'legislation [by a state] may, in a great variety of ways, affect commerce and persons engaged in it, without constituting a regulation of it within the meaning of the Constitution.\" Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, ante, p. 132, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, and cases cited in the opinion. The right of a state, in the exercise of the police power, to make regulations which indirectly affect interstate commerce, has been frequently sustained. In the present case it may be that the use of this kind of asphalt, under municipal authority conferred by the state will, in a limited degree, affect interstate commerce; but it certainly is not one of those direct interferences with the power over, and express control of, the subject given by the Constitution to Congress. In this day of multiplied means of intercourse between the states there is scarcely any contract which cannot, in a limited or remote degree, be said to affect interstate commerce. But it is only direct interferences with the freedom of such commerce that bring the case within the exclusive domain of Federal legislation.\n The attempt to invoke the provisions of the Sherman act in this case is equally unavailing. That act has been recently considered in the Northern Securities Cases,1 decided at this term, and its construction and the nature of the remedies under it determined. It is not intended to affect contracts which have a remote and indirect bearing upon commerce \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 624]\n\u00a0\n between the states. Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96.\n In addition to the ground by which Federal jurisdiction was established in the courts below, it is alleged that the tax bills should be held void because they were obtained by undue influence of the agents of the paving company, improperly exercised to obtain the needed muncipal action. The court below held, and an examination of the testimony has brought us to the same conclusion, that there was nothing in the case to establish the charges of fraud and corruption, although the record does show that an agent of the defendant company was active and perhaps influential in obtaining signatures to the petition which specified Trinidad Lake asphalt for this improvement; yet, in the absence of proof of fraud or corruption, we do not think the contract and resulting levies can be set aside for this reason. It is one thing to disapprove of such measures as a matter of propriety of action, but quite another to set aside a contract, especially after the full performance of its terms.\n Upon the cross appeal, the learned judge in the court below held that the Wyandotte street tax bills were void, because that street had been previously paved with macadam in the years 1892-1893, four or five years before the asphalt paving was laid, which macadam he found to be in good condition, and but little worn. The effect of this decree was, while finding against complainants as to the allegations of fraud and collusion in obtaining the contract, to hold that, in the opinion of the trial judge, the repaving of Wyandotte street was unnecessary. We think this conclusion overlooks the fact that the power to construct, improve, and pave streets was vested by the law of Missouri, as it generally is, in the board of aldermen. Mo. Laws 1895, 65,  85 to  95, inclusive. The necessity of such improvements is a matter of which they are the exclusive judges, and their judgment is not to be interfered with by the courts, except in cases of fraud or gross abuse of power. This power of the city board is a continuing \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 625]\n\u00a0\n one, and the mere fact that a pavement has been once laid does not require the interference of the courts when the governing body of the city, in the exercise of its judgment, has determined that the necessity for repaving has arisen. The law has vested this power in the representatives of the city, and the courts are not at liberty to determine whether the judgment is exercised wisely or unwisely. If this were not so, a contractor, who acts under the direction, and because of the action, of the city authorities in determining the necessity of an improvement, must lose his compensation if, upon the suit of a property owner, the courts shall take a different view of the necessity of the improvement. In other words, the contractor, though acting in good faith and complying in all respects with his agreement, lawfully made, must abide the judgment of the courts as upon appeal from the tribunal solely empowered by law to pass upon the necessity of the improvement, and to make the necessary contracts to carry it out.\n As we have said, there may be cases of fraud or arbitrary abuse of power, when the courts will intervene. Under other circumstances the municipality and property owners interested are bound by the acts of their agents. The authorities amply sustain this view. 2 Dill. Mun. Corp. 4th ed .  686; Wabash R. Co. v. Defiance, \n167 U.S. 88\n, 42 L. ed. 87, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 748; Skinker v. Heman, 148 Mo. 349, 49 S. W. 1026: Warren v. Barber Asphalt Pav. Co. 115 Mo. 580, 22 S. W. 490.\n Applying the principles settled by the authorities to the facts disclosed in this case, we do not find such evidence of fraud or gross abuse of power as would warrant the setting aside of the tax bills for this improvement. The testimony tends to show that the macadam was considerably worn; it replacement, to the extent of laying an asphalt pavement on top of it, was deemed necessary by the city authorities. It does not appear that any protest or objection was made during the progress of the work. A majority of the resident owners of lots abutting upon the part of the street to be improved had petitioned for the asphalt pavement. There is considerable \n\n[194 U.S. 618, 626]\n\u00a0\n testimony tending to show that the value of abutting property was enhanced by the improvement. These and kindred matters were before the board. It is not our province to review their judgment, and we do not think the courts are authorized to interfere with the discretion vested in them in making the improvement under the circumstances shown. To hold otherwise would be, as we have said, to substitute the judgment of the court as to the expediency or necessity of making such improvement for that of the body delegated by law with the power and responsibility of action in the premises.\n The court below, having properly held that the case alleged must fail on the other grounds, should have regarded the judgment of the board of aldermen as to the necessity of repaving Wyandotte street as conclusive upon it. The conclusion reached renders it unnecessary to consider whether the complainant, having failed to protest or object to the work before it was begun or during its progress, can be heard in a court of equity to object to the tax bills assessed for the benefit of the contractor, after the work is completed in compliance with the contract.\n We think the court below erred in adjudging the tax bills on Wyandotte street to be void, and so much of the decree is reversed with costs; the decree as to the other streets is affirmed, and the case remanded to the court below, with instructions to dismiss the bill. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 Sup.

Vilas for plaintiffs in error.\n Solicitor General Hoyt and Messrs. Marsden C. Burch and Robert A. Howard for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n This was an action of ejectment, commenced in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Arkansas, based upon the same title which was presented in Muse v. Arlington Hotel Co. \n168 U.S. 430\n, 42 L. ed. 531, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109, and Filhiol v. Maurice, \n185 U.S. 108\n, 46 L. ed. 827, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained on the ground of want of jurisdiction, and a judgment entered for the defendant, and thereupon the case was brought directly to this court on writ of error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The only question decided by the circuit court was one of jurisdiction, but the record contains no certificate of that question, nor anything which can be considered an equivalent thereto. The demurrer filed by the defendant stated three grounds therefor: First, a want of jurisdiction over the present defendant; second, a like want of jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action; and, third, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judgment was that the 'demurrer to the jurisdiction . . . be sustained' and the complaint dismissed. In the opinion of the court, only the question of jurisdiction over the subject-matter was discussed. The assignment of errors contains nine specifications, some going to the matter of jurisdiction; others, such as the fifth, eighth, and ninth, running to the merits, the ninth being general and in this language: 'The court erred in divers other matters manifest upon the face of the record of said action.' The petition for a writ of error alleged that the plaintiffs, 'being aggrieved by the judgment made and en- \n\n[194 U.S. 356, 358]\n\u00a0\n tered in the above entitled cause on the 12th day of January, 1903, and the several rulings of the court herein, file herewith their assignment of errors in said cause, and pray a writ of error, to the end that the rulings and judgment of said court in said cause may be reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States.' This petition was allowed generally, and without any limitation or specification. The necessity of a certificate was affirmed in Maynard v. Hecht, \n151 U.S. 324\n 38 L. ed. 179, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353, and what may be considered a sufficient certificate, or taken as equivalent thereto, considered in Re Lehigh Min & Mfg. Co. \n156 U.S. 322\n, 39 L. ed. 438, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375; Shields v.

United States, \n160 U.S. 499\n, 40 L. ed. 510, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, is closely in point. In that case Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, after referring to tests laid down in prior cases, observed (p. 508, L. ed. p. 513, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 399):\n'The record in the present case falls far short of satisfying any such test. The defendant, among many other defenses, and in various forms, objected to the jurisdiction of the district court, because the act of Congress under which the proceedings were instituted was unconstitutional, because the proceedings were not according to the laws of the United States, and because they should have been had in a court of the state of Maryland; and the court, overruling or disregarding all the objections, whether to its jurisdiction over the case, or to the merits or the form of the proceedings, entered final judgment for the petitioners. There is no formal certificate of any question of jurisdiction; the allowance of the writ of error is general, and not expressly limited to such a question; and the petition for the writ, after mentioning all the proceedings in detail, asks for a review of all the 'rulings, judgments, and orders' of the court 'upon the question of jurisdiction raised in said exceptions, pleas, and demurrers, and the other papers on file in this cause,' without defining or indicating any \n\n[194 U.S. 356, 359]\n\u00a0\n specific question of jurisdiction. Here, certainly, is no such clear, full, and separate statement of a definite question of jurisdiction as will supply the want of a formal certificate under the first clause of the statute.'\n\n There being no sufficient certificate of jurisdiction, counsel for plaintiffs in error rely upon the proposition that there is involved in the case the application of the Constitution of the United States, and also the meaning and force of the treaty of October 21, 1803, between the United States and the Republic of France, and that, therefore, the case was rightfully brought directly to this court.\n'But no question of jurisdiction having been separately certified or specified, and the writ of error having been allowed without restriction or qualification, this court, under the other clause of the statute, above cited, has appellate jurisdiction of this case as one in which the constitutionality of a law of the United States was drawn in question.' Chappell v. United States, \n160 U.S. 509\n, 40 L. ed. 513, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 400. See also Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475, 486\n, 47 S. L. ed. 909, 912, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639.\n\n The title upon which the plaintiffs rest was a grant made on February 22, 1788, by the governor general, in the name of the King of Spain, then the sovereign of the territory, and, as contended, protected by the treaty of 1803, which provided that the inhabitants of the province ceded should, among other things, 'be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their . . . property.' [ 8 Stat. at L. 202.] . . . property.' [8 Stat. at L. 202.] construction of the treaty, extended to the property of the original grantee, and descended from him to his heirs; but that the United States, denying that plaintiffs were entitled to be maintained and protected in the enjoyment of their said property by any construction of the treaty, asserted title to the land, expelled the plaintiffs from possession, and delivered it over to the defendant in this action, and that said defendant is in possession by direction of the United States, in pursuance of the unlawful and unjust possession so given him, and without any other right or claim of right than as an officer of the United States. Plaintiffs also \n\n[194 U.S. 356, 360]\n\u00a0\n averred that they were lawfully possessed of the land by inheritance from their ancestor, and that the United States, without process of law, and without legal right so to do, took the same for public use without any compensation, and established defendant in possession thereof wrongfully and unjustly. By virtue of these allegations they contend that there is involved in this case the construction of a treaty, as well as the application of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids the taking of private property for public use without just compensation.\n But it is well settled that in ejectment the plaintiffs must rest on their own title. If that title falls it is immaterial what wrong the defendant may have committed. There is nothing in the statutes of Arkansas which changes this rule. The averments of an infraction by the United States of its obligations under the treaty, or an unlawful act in taking possession without compensation, in defiance of the Constitution, do not add to the plaintiff's title. So far as the cause of action is concerned, these averments are superfluous. Any action by the government is matter of defense, and may never be presented by the defendant. He has a right to go to trial on the sufficiency of the title presented by the plaintiffs, and need neither plead nor prove the rightfulness of his possession by whomsoever it may have been given to him until they have shown that they have a title to the premises.\n'The right of the plaintiff to sue cannot depend on the defense which the defendant may choose to set up. His right to sue is anterior to that defense, and must depend on the state of things when the action is brought.' Osborn v. Bank 9 Wheat. 738, 824, 6 L. ed. 204, 224.\n\n'By the settled law of this court, as appears from the decisions above cited, a suggestion of one party, that the other will or may set up a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States, does not make the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws.'

Kochersperger, \n170 U.S. 303\n, 42 L. ed. 1046, 18 Sup. Ct.

Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 38 L. ed. 511, 14 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 47.\n\n We have not considered whether the averments distinctively made of the plaintiffs' title were sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the circuit court, for that question was settled against the plaintiff by the decision in Filhiol v. Maurice, \n185 U.S. 108\n, 46 L. ed. 827, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560.\n As the plaintiffs' statement of their right to the possession of this land disclosed no case within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, that jurisdiction was not established by allegations as to the defense which the defendant might make, or the circumstances under which he took possession.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISCHER v. CITY OF ST LOUIS(1904)\nNo. 204\nArgued: April 12, 1904Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 361, 362]\n\u00a0\n This proceeding was originally instituted by a criminal complaint filed by the city of St. Louis against Fischer in the police court for a violation of an ordinance of the city in erecting, building, and establishing on certain premises occupied by Fischer, at Nos. 7208 and 7210 North Broadway, a dairy and cow stable, without first having obtained permission so to do from the municipal assembly by proper ordinance, and for maintaining such dairy and cow stable without permission of such assembly.\n Motion was made to quash the complaint upon the ground, amongst others, that  5 of the ordinance under which the conviction was held was in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The case was submitted to the court upon the following agreed statement of the facts:\n'The plaintiff, the city of St. Louis, is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the state of Missouri, and defendant is and was on the 16th day of November, 1898, the occupant of certain premises known as 7208 and 7210 North Broadway, in the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, upon which premises, at said time, stood a dwelling-house and frame stable, which had been erected and built prior to the occupancy of said premises by defendant.'\n\n'At the time of the approval of ordinance No. 18,407, of said city and state, said premises, buildings, and stable were occupied and in use by a certain party other than this defendant, for the purpose of operating a dairy and maintaining a cow stable, and this defendant was, at the same time, operating a dairy and maintaining a cow stable on premises known as No. 6305 Bulwer avenue, in said city and state. Some time in the month of March, 1898, the said premises at Nos. 7208 and \n\n[194 U.S. 361, 363]\n\u00a0\n 7210 North Broadway were abandoned as a dairy and cow stable, and the dwelling-house thereon was occupied by a private family for residence purposes only, and no dairy or cow stable was maintained on said premises from March, 1898, until some time in September, 1898. In September, 1898, defendant moved his cows, about thirty in number, from premises No. 6305 Bulwer avenue, on to premises Nos. 7208 and 7210 North Broadway, placed them in the old stable, and did proceed to conduct upon said premises a dairy establishment, and produce from said cows milk, and sell the same to his customers for profit, and was so doing on the said 16th day of November, 1898, without having first obtained permission so to do from the municipal assembly by proper ordinance, as provided by  5 of ordinance No. 18,407 of the city of St. Louis, approved April 6, 1896.' a copy of which section is given in the margin. \n\n Upon this state of facts defendant was convicted and fined. An appeal was granted to the St. Louis court of criminal correction, which affirmed the judgment. An appeal was then taken to the supreme court of the state, where the judgment was again offirmed. 167 Mo. 654, 67 S. W. 872.\nMessrs. Louis A. Steber and J. E. McKeighan for plaintiff in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 361, 367]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William F. Woerner, Charles W. Bates, and Charles R. Skinker for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 361, 369]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The authority of the city of St. Louis to adopt the ordinance in question is found in the Revised Statutes of the state (1899, pp. 2484 and 2488), which declare: 'The mayor and assembly shall have power, within the city, by ordinance not inconsistent with the Constitution or any law of this state, or of this charter, . . . to . . . prohibit the erection of . . . cow stables and dairies . . . within prescribed limits, and to remove and regulate the same.'\n'Finally, to pass all such ordinances, not inconsistent with the provisions of this charter or of the laws of the state, as may be expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health, and welfare of the city, its trade, commerce, and manufactures, and to enforce the same by fines and penalties not exceeding $500, and by forfeitures not exceeding $1,000.\n\n The authority of the municipality of St. Louis, under this Zcharter, to adopt the ordinance in question, was settled by the decision of the supreme court, and is not open to attack here.\n Considerable stress is laid upon the fact that at the time the ordinance was adopted (April 6, 1896), the dairy and cow stable had already been erected, and at that time was occupied and in use for that purpose, though such use was subsequently abandoned, and the premises used as a private residence for a \n\n[194 U.S. 361, 370]\n\u00a0\n short time, when defendant moved his cattle there and established anew the dairy and cow stable which had theretofore been used. The supreme court, however, found that defendant was guilty of maintaining a dairy and cow stable, within the meaning of the ordinance, without permission of the municipal assembly, and as this construction of the ordinance involves no Federal question, we are relieved from the necessity of considering it.\n Defendant's objection to the ordinance, that it is made to apply to the whole city, when authority was only given by the charter to prohibit the erection of cow stables and dairies 'within prescribed limits,' is equally without foundation. If it were possible to prescribe limits for the operation of the ordinance, it was held by the supreme court to be equally possible to declare that those limits should be coincident with the limits of the city. This is also a non-Federal question.\n Defendant's main contention, however, is that, by vesting in the municipal assembly the power to permit the erection of dairy and cow stables to certain persons, a discrimination is thus declared in favor of such persons, and against all other persons, and the equal protection of the laws denied to all the disfavored class. The power of the legislature to authorize its municipalities to regulate and suppress all such places or occupations as, in its judgment, are likely to be injurious to the health of its inhabitants, or to disturb people living in the immediate neighborhood by loud noises or offensive odors, is so clearly within the police power as to be no longer open to question. The keeping of swine and cattle within the city or designated limits of the city has been declared in a number of cases to be within the police power. The keeping of cow stables and dairies is not only likely to be offensive to neighbors, but it is too often made an excuse for the supply of impure milk from cows which are fed upon unhealthful food, such as the refuse from distilleries, etc. Re Linehan, 72 Cal. 114, 13 Pac. 170; Quincy v. Kennard, 151 Mass. 563, 24 N. E. 860; Love v. Recorder's Court Judge, 128 Mich. 545, 55 L. R. A. 618, 87 N. W. 785. \n\n[194 U.S. 361, 371]\n\u00a0\n We do not regard the fact that permission to keep cattle may be granted by the municipal assembly as impairing, in any degree, the validity of the ordinance, or as denying to the disfavored dairy keepers the equal protection of the laws. Such discrimination might well be made where one person desired to keep two cows, and another fifty; where one desired to establish a stable in the heart of the city, and another in the suburds; or, where one was known to keep his stable in a filthy condition, and another had established a reputation for good order and cleanliness. Such distinctions are constantly made the basis for licensing one person to sell intoxicating liquors, and denying it to others. The question in each case is whether the establishing of a dairy and cow stable is likely, in the hands of the applicant, to be a nuisance or not to the neighborhood, and to imperil or conduce to the health of its customers. As the dispensing power must be vested in some one, it is not easy to see why it may not properly be delegated to the municipal assembly which enacted the ordinance. Of course, cases may be imagined where the power to issue permits may be abused, and the permission accorded to social or political favorites and denied to others, who, for reasons totally disconnected with the merits of the case, are distasteful to the licensing power. No such complaint, however, is made to the practical application of the law in this case, and we are led to infer that none such exists. We have no criticism to make of the principle of granting a license to one and denying it to another, and are bound to assume that the discrimination is made in the interest of the public, and upon conditions applying to the health and comfort of the neighborhood. Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 U.S. 86\n, 34 L. ed. 620, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13; Davis v. Massachusetts, \n167 U.S. 43\n, 42 L. ed. 71, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 731; Soon Hing v. Crowley, \n113 \nU.S. 703, 710\n, 28 S. L. ed. 1145, 1147, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730.\n The only alternative to the allowance of such exceptions would be to make the application of the ordinance universal. This would operate with great hardship upon persons who desire to establish dairies and cow stables in the outskirts of the city, as well as inconvenience to the inhabitants, who, to \n\n[194 U.S. 361, 372]\n\u00a0\n that extent, would be limited in their supply of milk. It would be exceedingly difficult to make exceptions in the ordinance itself without doing injustice in individual cases; and we see no difficulty in vesting in some body of men, presumed to be acquainted with the business and its conditions, the power to grant permits in special cases. It has been held in some of the state courts to be contrary to the spirit of American institutions to vest this dispensing power in the hands of a single individual (Chicago v. Trotter, 136 Ill. 430, 26 N. E. 359; Re Frazee, 63 Mich. 396, 6 Am. St. Rep. 310, 30 N. W. 72; State v. Fiske, 9 R. I. 94; Baltimore v. Radecke, 49 Md. 217, 33 Am. Rep. 239; Sioux Falls v. Kirby, 6 S. D. 62, 25 L. R. A. 621, 60 N. W. 156), and in others that such authority cannot be delegated to the adjoining lot owners (St. Louis v. Russell, 116 Mo. 248, 20 L. R. A. 721, 22 S. W. 470; Ex parte Sing Lee, 96 Cal. 354, 24 L. R. A. 195, 31 Am. St. Rep. 218, 31 Pac. 245). But the authority to delegate that discretion to a board appointed for that purpose is sustained by the great weight of authority (Quincy v. Kennard, 151 Mass. 563, 24 N. E. 860; Com. v. Davis, 162 Mass. 510, 26 L. R. A. 712, 44 Am. St. Rep. 389, 39 N. E. 113), and by this court the delegation of such power, even to a single individual, was sustained in Wilson v. Eureka City, \n173 U.S. 32\n, 43 L. ed. 603, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317; and Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 U.S. 183\n, 44 L. ed. 725, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633.\n Whether the defendant be in a position to avail himself of the alleged invalidity of the ordinance without averring that he applied for, and had been refused a permit to establish the dairy and cow stable in question, as was intimated in the latter case, is not necessary to a decision here, and we express no opinion upon the point.\n It is sufficient for us to hold, as we do, that the ordinance in question does not deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law, nor deny to him the equal protection of the laws.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is, therefore, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 5. No dairy or cow stable shall hereafter be erected, built, or established within the limits of this city without first having obtained permission so to do from the municipal assembly by proper ordinance, and no dairy or cow stable not in operation at the time of the approval of this ordinance shall be maintained on any premises unless permission so to do shall have been obtained from the municipal assembly by proper ordinance. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGAGNON v. U S(1904)\nNo. 163\nArgued: February 29, 1904Decided: March 21, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a petition filed in the court of claims in 1894 and amended in 1902, to recover the value of one half of certain property taken in 1866 from the firm of which the petitioner was a member by Indians then in amity with the United States.\n The facts found in the case were substantially as follows: Charles Gagnon was a British subject. In March, 1858, he declared before the district court of Woodbury county, Iowa, his intention to become a citizen of the United States. He \n\n[193 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n alleged that in 1863 he was admitted by the district court of Richardson county, in the territory of Nebraska, as a citizen of the United States, but no entry of this fact appeared in the records of that court for the year 1863\n\n\n It appeared Hosford & Gagnon, under which firm name they traded, owned horses and cattle of the aggregate value of $15,500 and in 1866, without just cause or provocation on their part, Indians belonging to the defendant tribes, then in amity with the United States, took them away. Hosford filed his claim for one half of the amount and obtained judgment, which has been satisfied. Gagnon's claim was for the remaining half.\n It further appeared that in the prosecution of his claim Gagnon failed to produce his certificate of naturalization, or a duly authenticated copy thereof. To meet the requirements of the law, providing that only citizens of the United States can recover under the Indian depredation act, Gagnon relied exclusively on a record of the district court for the first judicial district of the state of Nebraska (successor of the district court of the territory), purporting to enter nunc pro tunc a judgment of naturalization of the territorial court as of the date of September 25, 1863.\n No paper, memorandum, or entry of any kind was found in the records of the court tending to show that a certificate of naturalization had been issued to Gagnon in that year. It also appeared that the persons who held the offices of judge and clerk of the territorial court in 1863 were both dead.\n The record of the state court recited that it had been made to appear 'by competent evidence' that the alleged application for naturalization had been granted by the territorial court, but that the 'judgment of naturalization was never recorded, and if recorded, the record is lost and cannot be found in the records of this court, and it being legal and proper that said record should be supplied, and this court being willing that said error and omission be corrected, it is ordered and adjudged that said judgment so rendered by this court at its \n\n[193 U.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n September term, 1863, be entered at large on the journal of this court as of the date when it should have been entered, to wit, on the 25th day of September, 1863, and that the clerk issue to the said Charles Gagnon the proper certificate of naturalization,' etc.\n It further appeared that on March 19, 1897, Gagnon's attorneys wrote the Attorney General that application would be made to the district court of Richardson county, Nebraska, on March 29, 1897, 'for restoration of certain lost records relative to the naturalization of said Gagnon.'\n Upon the facts thus found the court of claims decided that Gagnon was not a citizen of the United States at the time the depredation was committed, and the petition was dismissed. 38 Ct. Cl. 10. Thereupon an appeal was taken to this court.\n Messrs. William E. Harvey, George A. King, and William B. King for appellant.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson and Mr. Harry Peyton for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case raises the simple question whether thirty-three years after a judgment naturalizing an alien is alleged to have been rendered but not recorded, or, if recorded, the record lost, a common-law court has jurisdiction to enter such judgment of naturalization nunc pro tunc, when no entry or memorandum appeared upon the record or files at the time the original judgment is supposed to have been rendered. If there be no jurisdiction to enter such judgment, it may be attacked collaterally.\n The power to amend its records, to correct mistakes of the clerk or other officer of the court, inadvertencies of counsel, or to supply defects or omissions in the record, even after the lapse of the term, is inherent in courts of justice, and was recognized by this court in Re Wight, \n134 U.S. 136\n, 33 L. ed. 865, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487; Gonzales v. Cunningham, \n164 \nU.S. 612, 623\n, 41 S. L. ed. 572, 576, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, and United States v. Vigil, 10 Wall. 423, 19 L. ed. 954. It is also conferred upon courts of the United States by Rev. Stat.  899, 900, and 901 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 675). This power, however, must be distinguished from that discussed by the court in Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 U.S. 410\n, 26 L. ed. 797, wherein we held that the authority of the court to set aside or modify an exist- \n\n[193 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n ing judgment or order ceased with the expiration of the term, and from that time all final judgments and decrees passed beyond its control, and that if such errors existed they could only be corrected by writ of error or appeal to a superior tribunal. An exception was there made of certain mistakes of fact not put in issue or passed upon, such as that a party died before judgment, or was a married woman, or was an infant and no guardian appeared or was appointed, or that there was error in the process through the default of the clerk. In the Federal courts the power to amend is given in general language in the final clause of Rev. Stat.  954 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 696), which declares that such courts 'may at any time permit either of the parties to amend any defect in the process or pleadings, upon such conditions as it shall, in its discretion and by its rules, prescribe.' As above indicated, however, this power has been restricted to amendments made during the progress of the case, or, at least, during the continuance of the term in which the judgment is rendered.\n This power to amend, too, must not be confounded with the power to create. It presupposes an existing record, which is defective by reason of some clerical error or mistake, or the omission of some entry which should have been made during the progress of the case, or by the loss of some document originally filed therein. The difference between creating and amending a record is analogous to that between the construction and repair of a piece of personal property. If a house or vessel, for instance, be burned or otherwise lost, it can only be rebuilt, and the word 'repair' is wholly inapplicable to its subsequent reconstruction. The word 'repair,' as the word 'amend,' contemplates an existing structure which has become imperfect by reason of the action of the elements, or otherwise. In the cases of vessels particularly, this distinction is one which cannot be ignored, as it lies at the basis of an important diversity of jurisdiction between the common-law and maritime courts.\n The power to recreate a record, no evidence of which exists, \n\n[193 U.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n has been the subject of much discussion in the courts, and the weight of authority is decidedly against the existence of such power. We have examined a large number of authorities upon this point, and while they do not altogether harmonize in their conclusions, the practice in some states being much more rigid than in others, we have found none which supports the contention that a record may be created to take the place of one of which no written memorandum was made or entered at the time the original judgment was supposed to have been rendered. The following cases contain instructive discussions of the principles involved, but an epitome of them would subserve no useful purpose: Bilansky v. Minnesota, 3 Minn. 427, Gil. 313; Schoonover v. Reed, 65 Ind. 313; Smith v. Hood, 25 Pa. 218, 64 Am. Dec. 692; State ex rel. Graves v. Primm, 61 Mo. 166; Brown v. Coward, 3 Hill, 4; Lynch v. Reynolds, 69 Bush, 547; Coughran v. Gutcheus, 18 Ill. 390; Frink v. Frink, 43 N. H. 508, 80 Am. Dec. 189; Rugg v. Parker, 7 Gray, 172; Balch v. Shaw, 7 Cush. 282.\n The power of the court to amend existing records is also considered at length in the following cases from the Federal courts, Tilghman v. Werk, 39 Fed. 680; Whiting v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. 8 C. C. A. 558, 13 U. S. App. 597, 60 Fed. 197, 200; Odell v. Reynolds, 17 C. C. A. 317, 37 U. S. App. 447, 70 Fed. 656, 659; Blythe v. Hinckley, 84 Fed. 228, 244.\n It may be gathered from these cases that, if a memorandum be entered upon the calendar that a certain document has been filed, such document, if lost, may be supplied by a copy in the hands of counsel; or where a judgment or order has been entered upon the calendar, which does not appear upon the journal, the court may order a new one to be entered nunc pro tunc. In such cases there is often a memorandum of some kind entered upon the calendar, or found in the files, and there is no impropriety in ascertaining the fact even by parol evidence and supplying the missing portion of the records. But the exercise of a power to recreate a record where no memorandum whatever exists of such record is evidently a dangerous one, and, although such power may have been occasionally \n\n[193 U.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n given by the legislature in cases of overwhelming necessity, as, for instance, by the 'lost record act' passed by the general assembly of Illinois after the great fire in Chicago in 1870 (Laws of Illinois, 1871-2, p. 650), such power has not been hitherto supposed to be inherent in courts of general jurisdiction. As the evidence upon which such restoration is made cannot be inquired into, if the jurisdiction to recreate the record exists, it might well happen that, upon the testimony of a single interested witness, the court would order a new record to be entered after a lapse, as in this case, of over thirty years, and when the judge and clerk have both died, and there was no possibility of contradicting the testimony of such single witness.\n Additional complications may also be properly referred to in this case in the fact that the declaration of intention was made before another court, in another state, and that the territorial court which is alleged to have entered the judgment of naturalization had itself been abolished and a state court substituted in its place. Did the jurisdiction exist to make this order of naturalization, there is nothing to prevent any person from applying to any competent court for a similar judgment of naturalization, or even a judgment for damages, and to have the same entered nunc pro tunc as of any date it would be for his interest to have it rendered. It is true that in this case notice was given to the Attorney General by the petitioner of his proposed application to the court for the restoration of 'certain lost records,' but if the jurisdiction to enter this judgment nunc pro tunc did not exist, it could not be given by this notice.\n As there was no competent evidence of the citizenship of the petitioner, there was no error in the action of the court below, and its judgment is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGERMAN SAV. & LOAN SOC. v. DORMITZER(1904)\nNo. 104\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 125, 126]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Scott Goodfellow, E. C. Hughes, and W. W. Hindman for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Robert A. Howard and Lucius G. Nash for defendants in error.\n Messrs. William M. Murray and Frederick W. Dewart for Ernest B. Tull.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of Washington on the ground that full faith and credit has not been given to a decree of divorce rendered in the state of Kansas. See 23 Wash. 132, 62 Pac. 862. The record is long, but all that is material to the case in this court can be stated in a few words. The defendants in error are the children of one F. M. Tull, and brought a complaint for the purpose, so far as the savings society, the plaintiff in error, is concerned, of establishing their right to an undivided share in certain land in Spokane, Washington, to which the savings society claims an absolute title. At least, that form of relief was held to be open under their complaint. Their claim was made on the ground that the land was community property of their parents, and that they inherited an undivided share upon their mother's death. The savings society claimed under the foreclosure of a mortgage executed by F. M. Tull. Before the execution of their mortgage, and after Tull had applied for a loan, his wife died, and probate proceedings were instituted under which Tull purported to purchase his children's interest as a preliminary to making the mortgage. It has been decided that these probate proceedings were void as against a purchaser with notice, and that the savings society took with notice. These are local matters, with which we have no concern. But the savings society contended that it had a good title, irrespective of these proceedings. The land was purchased with the proceeds of Kansas property which seems to have stood in the name of F. M. Tull. Tull procured a divorce in Kansas, and, if that \n\n[192 U.S. 125, 127]\n\u00a0\n divorce was valid, his wife's interest in his property was gone. Therefore, it is said, the land in Washington followed the character of the purchase money as his separate property, although, before the payment was completed, the divorced parties made up their differences, and were married to each other a second time.\n The supreme court of Washington, trying the case de novo, found that Tull had changed his domicil from Kansas to Washington before beginning his divorce proceedings, and therefore that the decree was without jurisdiction, and void. It further found, on evidence satisfactory to itself, that, the divorce being out of the way, the property was joint or community property, and that his children had the right they claimed. With this last again we are not concerned, and the only question for us is whether the court could go behind the record of the Kansas case.\n There is a motion to dismiss. It is said that the Federal question was not set up in the court below, and that the court put its decision on two distinct grounds, one of which was that the society was estopped to deny the children's title. The latter ground, it is said, was independent of the Federal question. But the opinion of the court deals expressly with the constitutional rights of the savings society, and the society seems to have insisted on those rights as soon as the divorce was attacked. Tullock v. Mulvane, \n184 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 504 S., 46 L. ed. 657, 662, 663, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372. As to the other point, it is at least doubtful whether the court meant to find any estoppel except on the footing that the property was shown to be community property. The motion to dismiss is overruled. See Johnson v. Risk, \n137 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 34 S. L. ed. 683, 686, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111.\n On the merits, however, the plaintiff in error has no case. It is suggested that the invalidity of the judgment for want of jurisdiction was not put in issue in the pleadings. It is a sufficient answer that the supreme court of the state treated it as in issue. Hill v. Mendenhall, 21 Wall. 453, 22 L. ed. 616, relied on by the plaintiff in error, came from the circuit court of the United \n\n[192 U.S. 125, 128]\n\u00a0\n States, and when a case properly is brought here from the circuit court upon constitutional grounds, the whole case is open. Horner v. United States, \n143 U.S. 570\n, 36 L. ed. 266, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522. But it is otherwise when a case comes, as this does, from a state court. Osborne v. Florida, \n164 \nU.S. 650, 656\n, 41 S. L. ed. 586, 588, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214; McLaughlin v. Fowler, \n154 U.S. 663\n, and 26 L. ed. 176, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192; Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L. ed. 429.\n It is too late now to deny the right collaterally to impeach a decree of divorce made in another state, by proof that the court had no jurisdiction, even when the record purports to show jurisdiction and the appearance of the other party. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 \nU.S. 14, 39\n, 47 S. L. ed. 366, 372, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237, 176 Mass. 92, 93, 57 N. E. 333. An attempt was made to avoid the authority of Andrews v. Andrews by the suggestion that there the respondent in the divorce suit had disappeared before the decree. But a respondent cannot defeat jurisdiction by disappearing. Indeed, in strictness, only the attorney disappeared, and the respondent simply ceased to defend the suit. The effect given to the statute of Massachusetts in that case depended wholly on contradicting the record of the divorce suit and proving the want of jurisdiction by proving the libellant's want of domicil in the state.\n It very well may be that, if the supreme court of Washington had undertaken to deny the jurisdiction of the Kansas tribunal without evidence impeaching it, such an evasion of the Constitution would not be upheld. It may be that in fact some circumstances were adverted to by that court which hardly warranted an inference. But it had before it the testimony of the husband, Tull, from which it appeared that before he made the contract for a part of the land in question he had sold out his property and business in Kansas, and had gone in search of what he called a new location, and that when he bought this land he decided to locate there. The land, it will be remembered, is in Spokane, Washington. Tull was there when the contract was made, and therefore there was ground for the court to find that at that moment he changed his domicil to Spokane. The contract was made on December 28, \n\n[192 U.S. 125, 129]\n\u00a0\n 1886, and the libel for divorce in Kansas was not filed until February 25, 1887. There was evidence warranting the finding, and that being so we take the facts as they were found. Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct.

This action was prosecuted to recover the difference between three fourths the pay of a brigadier general and that of a major general of the Army, accorded by statute to retired rear admirals. The court of claims dismissed the petition, holding the claimant entitled to three fourths the pay of a brigadier general. Upon the hearing in that court the following facts were found:\n'I. The claimant, William C. Gibson, was duly appointed a captain in the Navy, to rank from February 18, 1900. While serving in that grade, then being an officer of the Navy, with a creditable record, who served during the Civil War, he was retired by the following order:\n\n'Navy Department,\n\n Washington, June 30, 1900\n\n\n'Sir: On July 23, 1900, you will regard yourself transferred to the retired list of officers of the U.

Stat. 1901, p. 1020), and with the rank and three fourths of the sea pay of the next higher grade, i. e., rear admiral, in accordance with the provisions of  11 of the naval personnel act, approved March 3, 1899. 1\n\n Respectfully,\n John D. Long,\n Secretary.\n'Captain William C. Gibson, U. S. Navy, commanding U. S. S. Texas.'\n\n'II. Since his retirement he has received pay at the rate of \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n four thousand one hundred and twenty-five dollars ($4,125) a year, being three fourths of five thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500) the pay fixed by  1261 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 893), as that of a brigadier general in the Army.\n\n'If paid at the rate fixed by said  1261 for a major general in the Army, he would receive pay at the rate of three fourths of seven thousand five hundred dollars a year, being five thousand six hundred and twenty- five dollars ($5,625) a year, a difference of over and above what he has been receiving of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) a year.\n\n'III. From January 22, 1900, to July 3, 1900, inclusive, claimant was, by regular assignment, in command of the U. S. S. Texas, a seagoing vessel in commission. During that period he was, prior to the 18th of February, a commander, in receipt of pay at the rate of four thousand dollars ($4,000) a year, and from and after that date a captain, receiving pay at the rate of four thousand five hundred dollars ($4,500) a year. He did not, while so attached to and in command of said vessel, receive any sea ration or commutation therefor, under Revised Statutes,  1578 and 1585 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1083, 1085).

Thompson for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question presented is whether a captain in the Navy, retired as a rear admiral, under  1444 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and  11 of the Navy personnel act, shall receive three fourths of the pay of the rear admirals in the nine higher numbers in the list of rear admirals or the like proportion of the pay of the nine lower numbers of the eighteen rear admirals.\n Section 1444 of the Revised Statutes provides: 'When any officer below the rank of vice admiral is sixty-two years old, he shall, except in the case provided in the next section, be retired by the President from active service.'\n Section 11 of the navy personnel act reads: 'That any officer of the Navy, with a creditable record, who served during \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n the Civil War, shall, when retired, be retired with the rank and three fourths the sea pay of the next higher grade.' 30 Stat. at L. 1007, chap. 413 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1025).\n Section 13 provides: 'That after June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, commissioned officers of the line of the Navy and of the medical and pay corps shall receive the same pay and allowances, except forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers of corresponding rank in the Army.'\n In the first proviso of  7 of said act, provision having been made for eighteen rear admirals in the active list of the line of the Navy, it is enacted as follows: 'Provided, That each rear admiral embraced in the nine lower numbers of that grade shall receive the same pay and allowances as are now allowed a brigadier general in the Army.' 30 Stat. at L. 1005, chap. 413 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 982).\n The claimant, at the time of his retirement, was a captain in the United States Navy, who had served during the Civil War, and was retired, by order of the Secretary of the Navy, pursuant to  1444 of the Revised Statutes, with the rank and with three quarters of the sea pay of the next higher grade, in accordance with  11 of the navy personnel act above quoted.\n By  1466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1029), it is provided:\n'The relative rank between officers of the Navy, whether on the active or retired list, and officers of the Army, shall be as follows, lineal rank only being considered:\n\n'The vice admiral shall rank with the lieutenant general.\n\n'Rear admirals with major generals.\n\n'Commodores with brigadier generals.\n\n'Captains with colonels.\n\n'Commanders with lieutenant colonels.\n\n'Lieutenant commanders with majors.\n\n'Lieutenants with captains.\n\n'Masters with first lieutenants.\n\n'Ensigns with second lieutenants.' \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n Section 1261 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 893) fixes the pay of the officers of the Army:\n\n'The officers of the Army shall be entitled to the pay herein stated after their respective designations:\n\n'The general: thirteen thousand five hundred dollars a year.\n\n'Lieutenant general: eleven thousand dollars a year.\n\n'Major general: seven thousand five hundred dollars a year.\n\n'Brigadier general: five thousand five hundred dollars a year.\n\n'Colonel: three thousand five hundred dollars a year.'\n\n The claim of the appellant is, in substance, that the pay of the next higher grade above captain, the three quarters of which the appellant is to receive, is the full pay of a rear admiral,-that of a major general,- and not what is claimed to be the exceptional pay for the nine lower numbers of that grade, who are to receive the pay and allowance of a brigadier general.\n It is admitted in the discussion, that the provision fixing the pay of the nine rear admirals to correspond with the pay of a brigadier general arose from the fact that the relative rank of officers of the Army and Navy had been so adjusted by statute as to rank commodores with brigadier generals, and the rank of commodore being dropped from the service, the pay of a brigadier general was given to the nine lower numbers of the rear admirals, who would otherwise have had the rank of commodores, with the corresponding pay of brigadier generals.\n The argument for the appellant insists that the language is plain and so explicit as to need no construction; but the fact that the rear admirals are divided into two classes for the purposes of pay, and the statute not specifically pointing out which class of pay shall be given those situated as the claimant is, leads us to consider the objects to be attained by the new law, the circumstances under which it was enacted, and to construe the language used in view of the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.\n There is no question that, had the claimant been promoted in the active service from captain to rear admiral, he would have passed into the lower grade of rear admirals, so far, at least, as his pay was concerned, and would have received, so \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n long as within that number, the pay of a brigadier general, notwithstanding that for all other purposes he was entitled to the rank and privileges of a rear admiral.\n The appellant was promoted, and almost immediately retired; when thus retired, having served during the Civil War, he was given the rank of the next higher grade and three fourths of the sea pay of that grade. Congress had already created, for the purposes of pay, a division in the rank or grade of rear admiral, with higher pay for those of higher number and lower pay for others in the rank. It seems to us that it was the object of Congress, when retiring an officer under the circumstances stated, that he sould receive the pay of the next higher rank, and, but for the division made in the pay of rear admirals, he would receive the three quarters of the full pay of that rank; but, taking one step upward for the purpose of pay, he passes into, and not over, the next pay grade, which is that of the nine lower numbers.\n In regular gradation in the active service, a rear admiral, for the purposes of pay, must first serve through the nine lower numbers of the grade. So with a retiring officer; it is the purpose to give him, as compensation in the regular order of promotion, the pay of the 'next higher grade.' This conclusion is in harmony with the decision of this court in Rodgers v. United States [\n185 U.S. 83\n, L. ed. 816, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582] in which Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, said of this statute:\n'The individuals thus raised in rank were not so raised on account of distinguished services or for any personal reason, but simply in consequence of the abolition of the official rank they had held. Is it unreasonable to believe that Congress thought it unwise to give to those officers (who had neither by length of service or by personal distinction become entitled to the position of rear admiral, as it had stood in the past) all the benefits of such position? Would it be unnatural for Congress to bear in mind those who, by length of service, or by personal distinction, had already earned the position, and provide that in, at least, the matter of pay, there should be some recognition \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n of the fact? Again, is it unreasonable to believe that Congress intended that those officers whose past services placed them according to the prior relative rank side by side with brigadier generals of the Army should not, by a mere change of statute, be given a benefit in salary which was not at the same time accorded to brigadier generals in the Army? May not this explain its action in so dividing the rear admirals into two classes,-one composed substantially of former rear admirals, equal both in rank and pay with major generals in the Army, and the other of those who in the past were only commodores, to whom was given the rank of rear admirals, but the pay of brigadier generals in the Army?'\n\n We cannot believe that it was the intention of Congress that an officer upon retirement, and whose promotion shortly before his retirement was made for the purpose of giving him an increase of pay as well as rank, was intended to be given the higher grade of pay reserved for those of distinction or long service in the grade to which the retiring officer was promoted, leaving those in the active service who earned the right to promotion to receive the lower grade of pay. In short, we believe it was the intention of Congress to promote a retiring officer for the purposes of pay into the next grade above that in which he served before retirement. In this case such compensation was that provided for rear admirals of the lower grade. If this were not so, a retiring rear admiral would receive, under the circumstances now before us, more pay upon retirement than is given to the rear admirals in active service, in the lower pay grade. It is urged that the promotion and retirement of those who had rendered valuable service in the Civil War was the object of Congress, which purpose is best subserved by construing the statute to give in case of such promotions the full rank and pay of the grade to which the officer is promoted. This reasoning may be adequate to furnish a motive for such legislation, but we can only give effect to purposes expressed or necessarily implied in the terms of the statute. \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n But, it is urged, that in  8 and 9 of the navy personnel act, Congress, in providing for retirement of naval officers, has included the grade of commodores, and provides that captains within their terms shall be retired with three fourths the pay of the next higher grade, 'including the grade of commodore, which is retained on the retired list for this purpose,' thus evincing the purpose of Congress to retain the rank and pay of commodores in express terms when such is the purpose. But this reservation is for officers retired under these sections who are not to rank above commodores, while officers who served in the Civil War and are retired are to have the full rank of admirals, with the pay of the lower grade of the rank.\n We agree with the Comptroller of the Treasury and the court of claims in the construction to be given this statute. If the purpose of Congress has been mistaken, the law can be corrected by a new enactment making clear the intention to give the more liberal treatment contended for by the appellant.\n The question remains as to the right of this officer to receive commutation for the sea ration provided for by 1578 and 1585 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1083, 1085). These sections are:\n'Sec. 1578. All officers shall be entitled to one ration, or to commutation therefor, while at sea or attached to a sea-going vessel.'\n\n'Sec. 1585. Thirty cents shall in all cases be deemed the commutation price of the navy ration.'\n\n The provision of  13 of the navy personnel act is:\n'Officers of the line of the Navy . . . shall receive the same pay and allowances, except forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers of corresponding rank in the Army.' 30 Stat. at L. 1007, chap. 413 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1072).\n\n The claim upon this branch of the case is that  1578 and 1585 are not repealed in express terms by  13 of the navy personnel act, and, as repeals by implication are not favored, it is argued that, notwithstanding the later law, the allowance for sea rations still remains for naval officers. But \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n the later act distinctly provides that after June 30, 1899, commissioned officers of the line of the Navy and of the medical and pay corps shall receive the same compensation and allowance, except forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers of corresponding rank in the Army. This section was intended to cover, and in exact terms provides for, all pay and allowance for naval officers except forage. Where it is the intention of the statute to make a distinction or exception in allowance, that exception is expressly stated. The subject- matter of the later act provides for allowances to such officers, and it is to be the same as is now provided by law for Army officers of corresponding rank. Had Congress intended that such allowances as theretofore given should be continued, or to reserve, the right to commutation as to the sea ration, it would have been very easy to have inserted apt words which would have rendered effectual this purpose. But the terms of the law undertaking to revise former laws upon the subject make no such reservation as is contended for, and we think we are not at liberty to add to the statute by inserting it.\n It is true that repeals by implication are not favored, but where the same subject-matter is covered by two acts which cannot be harmonized with a view to giving effect to the provisions of each, to the extent of the repugnacy between them the latter act will prevail, particularly in cases where it is apparent that the later act was intended as a substitute for the earlier one. District of Columbia v. Hutton, \n143 U.S. 18\n-26, 36 L. ed. 60-62, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639.\n It is admitted that a change in the compensation of naval officers was made by the enactment of the new law, and, while  13 provided that such officers should not be reduced in pay, there is no provision retaining the allowances of the former act. Moreover,  26 of the navy personnel act provides that all acts and parts of acts, so far as they conflict with its provisions, shall be repealed. For the reasons stated we think the allowance of the previous statute cannot stand \n\n[194 U.S. 182, 193]\n\u00a0\n consistently with the express provision upon the same subject of the later act.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Claims, and the same is Affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

TEASLEY(1904)\nNo. 337\nArgued: January 5, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n These cases are writs of error to the supreme court of the state of alabama.\n In No. 337, the action was brought to recover damages in the sum of $ 5,000 against the board of registrars of Montgomery County, Alabama, for refusing to register the plaintiff as a qualified elector of the state. The substance of the complaint is: The plaintiff is a native of the state of Alabama, a resident of Montgomery county for thirty years, and of the voting precinct for more than two years. He applied for registration, having theretofore enjoyed the right of voting in the state; the application was made to the board to registrars on March 13, 1902; the plaintiff complied with all reasonable requirements of the board, but was arbitrarily refused the right of registration for no other reason than his race and color. At the same time a large number of negroes similarly situated were likewise refused, while all the white men were registered and given certificates, without denial, nor was any question raised as to their qualifications. The registrars required the plaintiff and all members of his race to furnish the testimony of two white men as to their qualifications, and refused to accept the testimony of colored persons, while all the white men \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n were registered without any proof except the oath of the applicant. It is alleged that  180, 181, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, and 188 of article 8 of the Constitution of the state of Alabama, which went into effect November 28, 1901, under authority of which the registrars were acting, was intended, designed, and enacted by the constitutional convention to deny and abridge the right of the plaintiff and others of his race in the state to vote, solely on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. The convention of the state of Alabama was composed entirely of white men, although the population of the state is composed of 1,001,152 white and 827,545 colored persons. It is alleged that article 180 of said Constitution is repugnant to the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States because subdivisions 1 and 2 of said section do not contain a statement of qualifications applicable to all, regardless of race, color, and previous condition of servitude, but discriminate against negroes solely on account of race. Subdivision 3 is unreasonable and void, in not defining what character a good citizen must have and what obligations he must understand under a republican form of government, and gives to the registrars a wide discretion and authority, and invests them with arbitrary power. That  181 of article 8 is repugnant to the said amendments to the Constitution of the United States in that, while it pretends to describe the qualifications of persons who shall apply for registration after January 1, 1903, it was in truth and in effect enacted to apply to the plaintiff and all negroes of the state, and not to operate against and affect any white persons in the state, and is a part of a scheme to disfranchise the negroes of Alabama on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. By refusing to permit the negroes to register the board of registrars is forcing them to wait until January 1, 1903, when  181 comes into effect. It is charged that said board is composed exclusively of white men, and the right of appeal given from the action of said board to the circuit court and thence to the supreme court of the state was given to more effectually hinder the plaintiff and others of his race in their right to vote, and not to accomplish \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n their registration. The negroes are excluded from serving on juries in the trial courts of the state and have been for many years, although qualified for the service, on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. That on appeal the plaintiff would encounter the same prejudice and obtain the same result as before the board of registrars. The defendants, well knowing the object of the constitutional provisions, were appointed by the state to administer the same, and while so engaged did wilfully and wrongfully refuse to register the plaintiff and others of his race for no other reason than their race and color, and thus deprived them of the right to vote as electors of the state, contrary to the provisions of the 1st section of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n In No. 338, the petition for mandamus contains like allegations as to the right of the petitioner to be registered as a voter in the state of Alabama, and avers that he is a person of good character and understands the duties of citizenship under a republican form of government. The petitioner avers, as in his petition for damages, his application to be registered March 13, 1902, which was arbitrarily refused for the reasons set forth in the petition for damages, contrary to the right of the petitioner. He repeats the allegations as to the registration of white persons, and avers that the denial of registration to him and others of his race was a denial by the state of Alabama of the equal protection of the laws, and the denial of his right to vote solely on account of his race, color, and previous condition of servitude, and was in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Allegations are inserted as to the intent and purpose of the state in calling the constitutional convention, and the adoption of the constitution September 3, 1901. It is alleged that the  180, 181, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, and 188 of article 8 of said new Constitution were enacted with the intent and for the purpose set forth in the petition for damages. Allegations are set forth as to the exclusion of the negroes from representation, notwithstanding the part they compose of the population of the state. It is claimed that \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n  180 of article 8 is obnoxious and repugnant to the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, in that it divides the inhabitants into three classes, viz.: 1, soldiers' class; 2, descendants of soldiers' class; 3, a class not soldiers nor their descendants. That the class not soldiers or their descendants are under greater restrictions and given greater burdens than the other classes. That  3 is void and unreasonable, failing to define what duties and obligations a citizen must understand under a republican form of government, and gives too wide a discretion to the registrars, amounting to vesting them with arbitrary power. Subdivisions 1 and 2 do not contain a statement of qualifications which are applicable to all alike, but discriminate against the negroes of the state on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude. The petition in mandamus contains substantially the allegations of the petition for damages as to the manner in which the Constitution was adopted, and avers that  181, describing the qualifications of persons who apply for registration after January 1, 1903, was designed and intended to apply to petitioner and others of his race, and not intended to operate against and affect white persons in the state of Alabama. It is charged that in the counties of Alabama colored persons are refused registration, while, under the same circumstances and possessing the same qualifications, white men are registered without objection, thereby compelling colored men to wait until January 1, 1903, when the provisions of  181 will be in operation, and compelling the colored men to have greater and different qualifications than are imposed upon the white men in the state, all of which, it is charged, was in pursuance of a design to evade the terms of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and to deny to the plaintiff and others of his race the equal protection of the laws, and to deprive them of the right to vote solely on account of their race, color, and previous condition of servitude. Petitioner repeats the allegations of the former petition for damages as to the composition of the board of registrars, and the remedy of appeal from their action to the courts of the state, and claims \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 151]\n\u00a0\n that if such appeal was prosecuted it could not be heard and determined before the election, but the hearing of the cases would take many years. There are attached to the petition as exhibits extracts from the speeches and debates in the convention of Alabama. The petition charges that the board of registrars refused to register colored men, so that not less than 75,000 of such persons were denied registration solely on account of race, color, and previous condition of servitude, although possessing the necessary qualifications of electors, while the white men were permitted to register without let or hindrance. Affidavits were filed with the petition setting forth the denial of the right of colored persons in various counties in the state of Alabama. The prayer of the petition is that the aforesaid sections of the state Constitution be declared absolutely null and void as repugnant to the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and for a writ of mandamus commanding the board of registrars to register the plaintiff as a qualified voter of the state of Alabama, and to issue to him a certificate of the fact, and the like to all voters of his race in the state of Alabama who were such under the Constitution of the state prior to the adoption of  180, 181, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, and 188 of the new Constitution of the state. And that said board be further commanded not to refuse to register said petitioner or other members of his race on account of their race or color and previous condition of servitude.\n To the petitions in both cases demurrers were filed in the court of original jurisdiction, which were sustained, and upon appellate proceedings in the supreme court of the state of Alabama the decisions of the lower court were affirmed. These writs of error seek to bring this action of the state courts in review here.\n Mr. Wilford H. Smith for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. A. Gunter for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The right to review in this court the judgment of a state court is regulated by  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575 ). The extent and nature of the remedy therein given has been the subject of numerous decisions. The jurisdiction in the cases now under consideration is invoked because of alleged denial of the rights of the plaintiff in error, secured to him by the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. When the jurisdiction depends, as in the present cases, upon a right, privilege, or immunity under the Constitution of the United States specially set up and denied in the state court, certain propositions, it is said by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court in Sayward v. Denny, \n158 U.S. 180\n-183, 39 L. ed. 941, 942, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 777, are well settled; among others, 'The right on which the party relies must have been called to the attention of the court in some proper way, and the decision of the court must have been against the right claimed. Hoyt v. Shelden, 1 Black, 518, 17 L. ed. 65; Maxwell v. Newhold, 18 How. 511, 515, 15 L. ed. 506, 508. . . . Or, at all events, it must appear from the record, by clear and necessary intendment, that the Federal question was directly invoked so that the state court could not have given judgment without deciding it.' It is equally well settled that if the decision of a state court rests on an independent ground-one which does not necessarily include a determination of the Federal right claimed-or upon a ground broad enough to sustain it without deciding the Federal question raised, this court has no jurisdiction to review the judgment of the state court. New Orleans v. New Orleans Waterwarks co. \n142 U.S. 79\n, 35 L. ed. 943, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142; Eustis v. Bolles, \n150 U.S. 361\n, 37 L. ed. 1111, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131; Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n-666, 38 L. ed. 305-308, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452; Wade v. Lawder, \n165 U.S. 624\n-623, 41 L. ed. 851, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425.\n In every case which comes to this court on writ of error or appeal the question of jurisdiction must be first answered, whether propounded by counsel or not. Defiance Waterworks \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 161]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Defiance, decided at this term, \n191 U.S. 184\n, ante, p. 63, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63. In No. 337, in which an action was begun against the registrars for damages, the case was decided upon demurrer to the declaration. The supreme court of Alabama placed its decision affirming the lower court, which sustained the demurrer, upon two grounds, as follows:\n'If we accept (without deciding) as correct the insistence laid in appellant's brief that  186 of article 8 of the Constitution of 1901 is void because repugnant to the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, then the defendants were wholly without authority to register the plaintiff as a voter, and their refusal to do so cannot be made the predicate for a recovery of damages against them.\n\n'On the other hand, if that section is the source of their authority, the jurisdiction is expressly conferred by it upon the defendants as a board of registrars to determine the qualifications of plaintiff as an elector and of his right to be registered as a voter. For their judicial determination that plaintiff did not possess the requisite qualifications of an elector, and their judicial act of refusing to register him, predicated upon that determination, they are not liable in this action. 17 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. pp. 727, 728, and notes. Affirmed.' 136 Ala. 164, 33 So. 819.\n\n A consideration of the plaintiff's petition shows that it attacked the provisions of the Alabama Constitution regulating the qualifications and registration of the electors of the state as an attempt to disregard the provisions of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by qualifying the whites to exercise the elective franchise and denying the same rights to the negroes of the state. It is alleged that  180, 181, 182, 184, 185, 186, 187, and 188 of the Alabama Constitution, which took effect on November 28, 1901, and under which the defendants were appointed registrars, and were acting at the time, were enacted by the state of Alabama, through its delegates to the constitutional convention, to deny and abridge the right of the plaintiff and others of his race to vote in the state on account of their color* \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 162]\n\u00a0\n and previous condition of servitude, without disfranchising a single white man in the state. These sections of the Alabama Constitution were before this court in the case of Giles v. Harris, \n189 U.S. 475\n, 47 L. ed. 909, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639, and the general plan of voting and registration was summarized by Mr. Justice Holmes, delivering the opinion of the court, as follows:\n'By  178 of article 8, to entitle a person to vote he must have resided in the state at least two years, in the county one year, and in the precinct or ward three months, immediately preceding the election, have paid his poll taxes, and have been duly registered as an elector. By  182, idiots, insane persons, and those convicted of certain crimes are disqualified. Subject to the foregoing, by  180, before 1903 the following male citizens of the state, who are citizens of the United States, were entitled to register, viz.: First. All who had served honorably in the enumerated wars of the United States, including those on either side in the 'war between the states.' Second. All lawful descendants of persons who served honorably in the enumerated wars or in the War of the Revolution. Third. 'All persons who are of good character and who understand the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government.' . . . By  181 after January 1, 1903, only the following persons are entitled to register: First. Those who can read and write any article of the Constitution of the United States in the English language, and who either are physically unable to work or have been regularly engaged in some lawful business for the greater part of the last twelve months, and those who are unable to read and write solely because physically disabled. Second. Owners or husbands of owners of 40 acres of land in the state, upon which they reside, and owners or husbands of owners of real or personal estate in the state, assessed for taxation at $300 or more, if the taxes have been paid, unless under contest. By  183, only persons qualified as electors can take part in any method of party action. By  184, persons not registered are diqualified from voting. By  185, an elector whose vote is challenged shall be required to swear that the matter of the challenge is untrue before his vote shall be received. By  186, \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 163]\n\u00a0\n the legislature is to provide for registration after January 1, 1903, the qualifications and oath of the registrars are prescribed, the duties of registrars before that date are laid down, and an appeal is given to the county court and supreme court if registration is denied. There are further executive details in  187, together with the above-mentioned continuance of the effect of registration before January 1, 1903. By  188, after the last-mentioned date applicants for registration may be examined under oath as to where they have lived for the last five years, the names by which they have been known, and the names of their employers.'\n\n It is apparent that paragraph 3 of  180, permitting the registration of electors before 1903, of 'all persons who are of good character and who understand the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government,' opened a wide door to the exercise of discretionary power by the registrars. It is charged that this section, in connection with  181, permitting the registration of certain persons after January, 1903, was intended to be so carried into operation and effect that the negroes of Alabama should be excluded from the elective franchise, and to permit the white men to register before January 1, 1903, and thus become electors, compelling the colored men to wait until after January 1, 1903, and then to apply under conditions which were especially framed and would have the effect to exclude the colored man from voting. It is charged that the registrars well knew the scheme and purpose set forth in the complaint to work the disfranchisement of negro voters and to qualify the white voters to exercise the elective franchise, and it is charged that the defendants were appointed by the state under sections of the state Constitution adopted for the purpose of denying the colored man the right to vote and under which the defendants are undertaking to carry out the scheme and were so acting when they denied the right of the plaintiff to register, thus depriving him of the right guaranteed to him by the 1st section of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A consideration of the allegations of this complaint, to which the demurrer was sustained, \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 164]\n\u00a0\n makes apparent that the Federal right for which the plaintiff sought protection and the recovery of damages was that secured by the amendment to the Federal Constitution which prohibits a state from denying to the citizen the right of suffrage because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. But in the present case the state court has not sustained the right of the state to thus abridge the constitutional rights of the plaintiff. It has planted its decision upon a ground independent of the alleged state action seeking to nullify the force and effect of the constitutional amendments protecting the right of suffrage. The first ground of sustaining the demurrer is, in effect, that, conceding the allegations of the petition to be true, and the registrars to have been appointed and qualified under a constitution which has for its purpose to prevent negroes from voting and to exclude them from registration for that purpose, no damage has been suffered by the plaintiff, because no refusal to register by a board thus constituted in defiance of the Federal Constitution could have the effect to disqualify a legal voter, otherwise entitled to exercise the elective franchise. In such a decision no right, immunity, or privilege, the creation of Federal authority, has been set up by the plaintiff in error, and denied in such wise as to give this court the right to review the state court decision. This view renders it unnecessary to consider whether, where a proper case was made for the denial of the right of suffrage, it would be a defense for the election officers to say that they were acting in a judicial capacity where the denial of the right was solely because of the race, color, or previous condition of servide of the plaintiff. In the ground first stated we are of opinion that the state court decided the case for reasons independent of the Federal right claimed, and hence its action is not reviewable here.\n In the case for a writ of mandamus the same attack was made upon the action of the state of Alabama in adopting and enforcing the provisions of the state constitution, which it was charged were adopted for the purpose of disfranchising the negroes and permitting white men only to exercise the elective \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 165]\n\u00a0\n franchise. In the mandamus case the decision of the state court was:\n'The petition in this case is for a writ of mandamus to compel the board of registrars for Montgomery county to register the petitioner as an elector. It alleges that  180, 181, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, and 188 of art. 8 of the Constitution of 1901, fixing the qualifications of electors, and prescribing the mode of registration, are unconstitutional because violative of the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. The prayer is in substance that these sections of the Constitution above enumerated be declared null and void and that an alternative writ of mandamus issue to the board of registrars commanding them to register as a qualified elector of the state of Alabama, upon the books provided therefor, the name of petitioner, and to issue to him a certificate of the fact in disregard of said sections of the Constitution, etc.\n\n'As these sections of the Constitution assailed created the board of registrars, fixed their tenure of office, defined and prescribed their duties, if they are stricken down on account of being unconstitutional, it is entirely clear that the board would have no existence and no duties to perform. So then, taking the case as made by the petition, without deciding the constitutional question attempted to be raised or intimating anything as to the correctness of the contention on that question, there would be no board to perform the duty sought to be compelled by the writ, and no duty imposed of which the petitioner can avail himself in this proceeding, to say nothing of his right to be registered.-Affirmed.' 136 Ala. 228, 33 So. 820.\n\n We do not perceive how this decision involved the adjudication of a right claimed under the Federal Constitution against the appellant. It denies the relief by way of mandamus, admitting the allegations of the petition as to the illegal character of the registration authorized in pursuance of the Alabama Constitution.\n This is a ground adequate to sustain the decision and wholly independent of the rights set up by the plaintiff as secured to him by the constitutional amendments for his protection. \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 166]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff in error relies upon two cases adjudicated in this court: Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 U.S. 58\n, 45 L. ed. 84, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17; and Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 U.S. 487\n, 46 L. ed. 1005, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783. In the former it was held that an action may be sustained in a court of the United States against election officers for refusing the plaintiff's vote for member of Congress. The allegations of the complaint are set forth in full in the statement of the case, and it appears that the board of managers were averred to be legally qualified to preside at the Federal election, and as such wrongfully refused the proffered vote of the plaintiff, a duly qualified elector, wilfully and without legal excuse. It was held that the complaint was defective for not averring that the plaintiff was a duly registered voter. It appeared that the registration law had not been held unconstitutional, and it further appeared that if such was the fact plaintiff was not in a position to impugn its constitutionality. In Swafford v. Templeton it was held that the circuit court erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction an action kindred to that sustained in Wiley v. Sinkler, wherein the plaintiff was denied the right to vote for member of Congress, which was held to have its foundation in the Constitution of the United States, with consequent jurisdiction in a Federal court to redress a wrongful denial of the right. Neither of these cases are in point in determining our right to review the action of the state court in the case now before us. It is apparent that the thing complained of, so far as it involves rights secured under the Federal Constitution, is the action of the state of Alabama in the adoption and enforcing of a constitution with the purpose of excluding from the exercise of the right of suffrage the negro voters of the state, in violation of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The great difficulty of reaching the political action of a state through remedies afforded in the courts, state or Federal, was suggested by this court in Giles v. Harris, \n189 U.S. 475\n, 47 L. ed. 909, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639.\n In reaching the conclusion that the present writs of error must be dismissed the court is not unmindful of the gravity of the statements of the complainant charging violation of a constitutional amendment which is a part of the supreme law \n\n[193 U.S. 146, 167]\n\u00a0\n of the land; but the right of this court to review the decisions of the highest court of a state has long been well settled, and is circumscribed by the rules established by law. We are of opinion that plaintiffs in error have not brought the cases within the statute giving to this court the right of review.\n The writs of error in both cases will be dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGLOUCESTER WATER SUPPLY CO v.

Under the authority of a statute enacted in 1895, similar in tenor to the act of 1894, considered in the Newburyport Case, the Gloucester company sold its plant to the city of Gloucester. After the sale the company petitioned for the appointment of commissioners to value the property. Objections were made by both parties to the award, and the objections were reserved for consideration to the full bench of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts. That court accepted the award for the sum of $576,544 with interest. 179 Mass. 365, 60 N. E. 977. Thereafter the present suit in equity was \n\n[193 U.S. 580, 581]\n\u00a0\n instituted in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, the bill filed containing substantially similar allegations to those made in the Newburyport Case. Similar relief was also sought, except that there was no claim that the commissioners had not made an allowance for the unexpired term of the hydrant contract. After the decision in the Newburyport Case the circuit court sustained a demurrer and dismissed the bill on the merits.\n For the reasons stated in the opinion delivered in the Newburyport Case, the decree of the Circuit Court is reversed at appellant's costs, and the case remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAND RAPIDS & I R CO v. OSBORN(1904)\nNo. 61\nArgued: November 6, 1903Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the supreme court of the state of Michigan, which affirmed an order of the circuit court of Kent county, Michigan, awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus. By the writ the plaintiff in error was, in effect, commanded to reduce its rates for the transportation of passengers over its lines of railroad from \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n 3 cents per mile to 2 1\/2 cents per mile, as required by an act of the legislature of Michigan known as act 202 of the session of 1889\n\n\n The Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad Company was the original owner of the road in question. That company was incorporated under the laws of Michigan and Indiana in 1870, and its line of railroad was constructed and put into operation before January 1, 1873. It also owned and operated in Michigan a number of short branch lines and several leased lines; and its mileage in Michigan exceeded 300 miles. During the period between the incorporation of the company and the construction of its road, railroad companies which were operating in Michigan were authorized to regulate the tolls and compensation to be paid for the transportation in that state of persons and their baggage, but the charge which might be made for such transportation was limited to 3 cents per mile on roads over 25 miles in length. The Michigan statutes also contained provisions authorizing the execution of mortgage and the issue of bonds by railroad corporations. By act 198 of the session of 1873, the laws relating to railroads were revised, and such revision with amendments is still in force. Mich. Comp. Laws 1897, chap. 164, pp. 1937-2000. It was therein provided that corporations organized under a prior general railroad law 'shall be deemed and taken to be organizations under this act.' By subdivision 9 of  9 of article 2 the maximum charge which railroad corporations might make for the transportation of passengers and their ordinary baggage on roads exceeding 25 miles in length was fixed at 3 cents per mile. Power was also conferred upon railroad companies to borrow money, issue bonds or other obligations therefor, and to mortgage their corporate property and franchises, and the income thereof, or any part thereof, as security. Section 2 of article 1 of the act was as follows:\n'In case of the foreclosure and sale of any railroad, or part of any railroad, under any trust deed, or mortgage given to secure the payment of bonds sold to aid in its construction and equipment, or for other cause authorized by law, it shall \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n be competent and lawful for the parties who may become the purchasers, and such others as they may associate with themselves, to organize a corporation for the management of the same, and issue stock in the same in shares of $100 each, to represent the property in said railroad; and such corporation, when organized, shall have the same rights, powers, and privileges as are or may be secured to the original company whose property may have been sold under and by virtue of such mortgage or trust deed. Such organization may be formed by virtue of a declaration or certificate of the purchasers at the sale under said mortgage or trust deed, which shall set forth the description of the property sold, and the date of the deed under which it was sold, or the decree of the proper court, if it shall have been sold by virtue of a decree of any court; and with such description of the parties to the deed or suit as may identify the one or the other, or both; the time of the sale, and the name of the officer who sold the same; and also the purchasers, and the amount paid, and the stockholders to whom stock is to be issued, and the amount of the capital stock and the name of the new corporation, and such other statements as may be found requisite to make definite the corporation whose property may have been sold, and the property sold, as well as the extents and rights and property of the new company; which said certificate or declaration shall be signed by all of the said purchasers, and shall be addressed to the secretary of state; and being filed and recorded in his office, the said corporation shall become complete, with all the powers and rights secured to railroad companies under this act, to all the provisions of which, and amendments thereto, it shall be subject, and a certified copy of the said certificate or declaration shall be prima facie evidence of the due organization of said company.'\n\n There was also a general provision that the act might be altered, amended, or repealed, but that such alteration, amendment, or repeal 'shall not affect the rights or property of companies organized under it.'\n In 1884 the Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad Company executed a second mortgage upon its railroad property to \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n secure an issue of $3,000,000 of bonds. While this mortgage was in force, and in the year 1889, subdivision 9th of  9 of article 2 of the general railroad law of 1873-the section containing an enumeration of powers conferred upon railroad corporations-was amended to read as follows:\n'Ninth. To regulate the time and manner in which passengers and property shall be transported, and the tolls and compensation to be paid therefor; but such compensation for transporting any passenger, and his or her ordinary baggage, not exceeding in weight 150 pounds, shall not exceed the following prices, viz.: for a distance not exceeding 5 miles, 3 cents per mile; for all other distances, for all companies the gross earnings of whose passenger trains, as reported to the commissioner of railroads for the year 1888, equaled or exceeded the sum of $3,000 for each mile of road operated by said company, 2 cents per mile, and for all companies, the earnings of whose passenger trains reported as aforesaid were over $2,000 and less than $3,000 per mile of road operated by said company, 2 1\/2 cents per mile, and for all companies whose earnings reported as aforesaid were less than $2,000 per mile of road operated by said company, 3 cents per mile: Provided, That in future, whenever the earnings of any company doing business in this state, as reported to the commissioner of railroads at the close of any year, shall increase so as to equal or exceed the sum of $2,000 or $3,000 per mile of road operated by said company, then in such case companies shall thereafter, upon the notification of the commissioner of railroads, be required to only receive as compensation for the transportation of any passenger and his or her ordinary baggage, not exceeding in weight 150 pounds, a rate of 2 1\/2 cents, or 2 cents per mile, as hereinbefore provided: Provided, That roads in the Upper Peninsula which report as above provided passenger earnings exceeding $3,000 per mile, shall not charge to exceed 3 cents per mile, and roads reporting \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n less than $3,000 per mile shall be allowed to charge not to exceed 4 cents per mile. . . .'\n\n The mortgage of 1884 was foreclosed; and, in 1896, under decrees of circuit courts of the United States, the property covered by such mortgage was sold to John C. Sims, subject to a prior mortgage securing a large issue of outstanding bonds. Sims and his associates subsequently executed the certificate authorized by, and complied with all the requirements mentioned in,  2 of article 1 of the general railroad law of 1873 aforesaid, and by virtue thereof the plaintiff in error came into existence and took control of the railroad property in question. It continued to exact a charge for the transportation of passengers and their ordinary baggage of 3 cents per mile.\n In a statutory report made in 1891 by the plaintiff in error to the commissioner of railroads of Michigan it was represented that the gross earnings in Michigan of the passenger trains on its lines of railroad exceeded $2,000 per mile of road operated. Thereupon said commissioner notified plaintiff in error to reduce its rates on passenger traffic to 2 cents per mile for distances exceeding 5 miles. The order not being obeyed, a proceeding in mandamus was instituted to compel compliance. In its answer to the rule to show cause the company specially set up the claim that, so far as it was concerned, the statute was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment, and also violated the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. It recited the cost to the plaintiff in error of the property indirectly acquired by it under the foreclosure, the amount of outstanding capital stock, the bonded indebtedness of the road, and the annual interest on such bonded debt; and represented that the income from passenger traffic which would be received if it put in force the reduced rates would leave but a trifling surplus after deduction of reasonable operating expenses, interest on debt, and other fixed charges. It was also averred in support of the charge that the act was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, that the gross receipts from passenger traffic in Michigan forming the basis of the \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n proposed reduction in rates included receipts from interstate traffic, and that if such interstate traffic receipts were not included the gross receipts would be less than $2,000 per mile, and hence the reduced rates would not be enforceable.\n On the hearing of the order to show cause it was contended on behalf of the relator that the railroad company, by incorporating under the law which embodied the provisions complained of, thereby entered into a contract with the state to carry passengers at the rate fixed in the statute. By leave a demurrer was filed to the answer, the single ground stated in support thereof being the following:\n'That upon its incorporation in 1896 under the general railroad law, the said respondent entered into and became a party, to a contract with the state of Michigan, one of the conditions of which is the agreement on the part of said respondent to carry all passengers at the rates fixed by subdivision 9th,  9 of article 2 of said general railroad law, under which it is incorporated.'\n\n The circuit court sustained the demurrer, and awarded a peremptory mandamus commanding the railway company to 'forthwith and hereafter issue and cause to be issued tickets to all persons applying therefor and desiring to travel over its line of road in the state of Michigan, and to accept tolls or compensation for transporting any person and his or her ordinary baggage, not exceeding in weight 150 pounds, at the rate of 2 cents per mile for all distances exceeding 5 miles.' The record by writ of certiorari was removed to the supreme court of Michigan. In that court leave was given to add to the demurrer the following additional ground, viz.: '2. That upon its incorporation in 1896 under the general railroad law, the said respondent became subject to that law and the provision therein requiring it to carry passengers at the rates fixed in subdivision 9th,  9 of article 2 of that law, said provision in regard to rates being one of the conditions of the existence of respondent.' Waiting a decision of the first ground of demurrer, the order awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus was affirmed upon the second ground just recited. 130 Mich. \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n 248, 89 N. W. 967. By writ of error the judgment of affirmance has been brought here for review.\n Messrs. T. J. O'Brien and James H. Campbell for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Horace M. Oren and Charles A. Blair for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 17, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A jurisdictional question which was raised by the defendant in error requires first to be disposed of. It was objected that the judgment of the supreme court of Michigan in the case at bar was not based upon a Federal question, and hence this court is, it is urged, without jurisdiction to entertain this writ of error. The objection, however, is not well founded. It is plain from the averments of the answer of the railroad company to the petition in mandamus, that the company relied upon the provisions of the general railroad law of 1873, authorizing the incorporation of the purchasers of a railroad after sale in the foreclosure proceedings, as constituting a contract protected by the Constitution of the United States. The determination of the alleged estoppel embodied in the ground \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 28]\n\u00a0\n of demurrer to the answer of the railroad company, and which was sustained by the supreme court of Michigan, necessarily involved a consideration of this claim of a contract right, protected from impairment by the Constitution of the United States. In substance, if not in express terms, such question was passed upon by the court below. A Federal question which gives this court jurisdiction therefore arises on the record.\n That the section of the general railroad law of 1873, making provision for the creation of a new corporation upon the reorganization of a railroad by the purchaser at a foreclosure sale, did not constitute a contract protected by the Constitution of the United States, is concluded by the decision in New York ex rel. Schurz v. Cook, \n148 U.S. 397\n, 37 L. ed. 498, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645. There the purchasers of railroad property in the state of New York under a sale upon foreclosure of a mortgage sought to escape the payment of an incorporation fee laid by the authority of certain statutes of the state of New York enacted after the execution of the mortgage. The claim was made that the statutes of the state of New York authorizing the purchasers of railroads sold upon foreclosure to incorporate, which were in force when the mortgage was executed, constituted a contract between the state of New York and the bondholders and their privies, and that the enforcement of the subsequent statute providing for the payment of an incorporation fee violated the obligation of the alleged contract. The court of appeals of New York held to the contrary, and its judgment was affirmed by this court. In the course of the opinion of this court it was said (p. 410, L. ed. p. 503, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 649):\n'The plaintiffs in error acquired the properties and franchises of these corporations, which were subject to the taxing power of the state, after the act of 1886 was passed and went into effect. There is no provision of the law under which they made their purchase requiring them to become incorporated, but desiring corporate capacity they demanded the grant of a new charter under which to exercise the franchises so acquired without compliance with the law of the state existing at the time their application for incorporation was made. We are clearly of the opinion that the act of 1874, as amended in 1876, set up and relied upon by them, does not sustain such a \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 29]\n\u00a0\n claim. The provisions of that act do not constitute a contract on the part of the state with either the corporations or the mortgagees, bondholders, or purchasers at foreclosure sale. They are merely matters of law instead of contract, and the right therein conferred upon purchasers of the corporate properties and franchises sold under foreclosure of mortgages thereon, to reorganize and become a new corporation, is subject to the laws of the state existing or in force at the time of such reorganization and the grant of a new charter of incorporation. Memphis & L. R. Co. v. Railroad Commissioners, \n112 U.S. 609\n, 28 L. ed. 837, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299.\n\n It results from the foregoing that Sims-the purchaser of the railroad property in question at the sale under foreclosure-and his associates could not demand to be incorporated under the statutes of Michigan as a matter of contract right. Possessing no such contract right, they or their privies cannot now be heard to assail the constitutionality of the conditions which were agreed to be performed when the grant by the state was made of the privilege to operate as a corporation the property in question. Having voluntarily accepted the privileges and benefits of the incorporation law of Michigan the company was bound by the provisions of existing laws regulating rates of fares upon railroads, and it is estopped from repudiating the burdens attached by the statute to the privilege of becoming an incorporated body. Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 U.S. 415\n, 26 L. ed. 187, and cases cited. That a railroad corporation may contract with a municipality or with a state to operate a railway at agreed rates of fare is unquestionable. And where the provisions of an accepted statute respecting rates to be charged for transportation are plain and unambiguous, and do not contravene public policy or positive rules of law, it is clear that a railroad company cannot avail of privileges which have been procured upon stipulated conditions, and repudiate performance of the latter at will. Whether, if a condition in a statute is couched in ambiguous language, and is susceptible of two constructions, as it is claimed is the case before us in respect to the basis upon which the gross receipts per mile of operated roal was to be calculated, a construction should be \n\n[193 U.S. 17, 30]\n\u00a0\n adopted which will not render the condition repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, we need not determine. The statute in question, in its entirety, has been construed by the supreme court of Michigan, and held valid, and its decision as to the proper interpretation of the language of the act in respect to the mode of ascertaining the gross receipts per mile does not render the statute repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, within the ruling recently made by this court in Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, ante, p. 107, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT SOUTHERN FIRE PROOF HOTEL CO v.

McKennan, and Outhwaite, Linn, & Thurman for respondents.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Company, a corporation of Ohio, made a contract with one McClain for the construction of a hotel building and opera house at Columbus, Ohio.\n McClain contracted with Jones & Laughlins, Limited, a partnership association organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, for a certain amount of steel to be used in the buildings which he undertook to erect.\n Under that contract Jones & Laughlins, Limited, furnished steel of the value of $43,296.74.\n Proceeding under certain statutes of Ohio relating to liens for mechanics and others, Jones & Laughlins, Limited, brought suit in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Ohio against the hotel company, to enforce a lien asserted by them on the hotel building and opera house for the balance due on their contract with McClain. Various persons were made defendants because they asserted claims upon or interest in the property. It was a case in which the jurisdiction of that court depended upon diversity in the citizenship of the parties. Upon final hearing the circuit court dismissed the bill on the ground that the statute of Ohio of April 13th, 1894 (91 Ohio Laws, 135), under which Jones & Laughlins, Limited, proceeded, was repugnant to the Constitution of Ohio. 79 Fed. 477. Upon appeal to the circuit court of appeals, that court, being of opinion that the statute was constitutional, reversed the decree of the circuit court. 30 C. C. A. 108, 58 U. S. App. 397, 86 Fed. 370. The case was \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n then brought here upon writ of certiorari, and this court, without considering the merits, reversed the judgments of both courts upon the ground that the record did not affirmatively show a case of which the circuit court could properly take cognizance, so far as the citizenship of the parties was concerned. In the opinion then rendered we said that, under the circumstances, the plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their pleadings as to the citizenship of the parties; and, if a case could be presented within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, the parties should be allowed to proceed to a final hearing on the merits.

Rep. 690.\n Upon the return of the cause the plaintiffs filed an amended bill of complaint, which cured the defect in its original bill as to the citizenship of the parties. The case went to a final hearing upon the merits, and a decree was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs. That decree was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals. Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 54 C. C. A. 165, 116 Fed. 793. The case is again here upon a writ of certiorari granted upon motion of the hotel company.\n The statutory provisions, questions as to the constitutionality of which have been raised in this case, are certain sections of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, as follows:\n'Sec. 3184. A person who performs labor, or furnishes machinery or material for constructing, altering, or repairing a boat, vessel, or other water craft, or for erecting, altering, repairing, or removing a house, mill, manufactory, or any furnace or furnace material therein, or other building, appurtenance, fixture, bridge, or other structure, or for the digging, drilling, plumbing, boring, operating, completing, or repairing of any gas well, oil well, or any other well, or performs labor of any kind whatsoever, in altering, repairing, or constructing any oil derrick, oil tank, oil or gas pipe line, or furnishes tile for the drainage of any lot or land by virtue of a contract with, or at the instance of, the owner thereof or his agent, trustee, contractor, or subcontractor, shall have a lien to secure the \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n payment of the same upon such boat, vessel, or other water craft, or upon such house, mill, manufactory, or other building or appurtenance, fixture, bridge, or other structure, or upon such gas well, oil well, or any other well, or upon such oil derrick, oil tank, oil or gas pipe line, and upon the material and machinery so furnished, and upon the interest, leasehold or otherwise, of the owner in the lot or land on which the same may stand, or to which it may be removed.\n\n'Sec. 3185. Such person, in order to obtain such lien, shall, within four months from the time of performing such labor, or furnishing such machinery or material, file with the recorder of the county where the labor was performed, or the machinery or material furnished, an affidavit containing an itemized statement of the amount and value of such labor, machinery, or material, and a description of any promissory note or notes given for such labor, machinery, or material, or any part thereof, with all credits and offsets thereon, a copy of the contract, if it is in writing, a statement of the amount and times of payment to be made thereunder, and a description of the land on which the gas well, oil well, or other wells are situated, or the land on which the house. mill, manufactory, or other buildings, or appurtenance, fixture, bridge, or other structure may stand, or to which it may be removed; and the same shall be recorded in a separate book to be kept therefor, and shall operate as a lien from the date of the first item of the labor performed or the machinery or material furnished upon or toward the property desigated in the preceding section, and the interest of the owner in the lot or land on which the same may stand, or to which it may be removed, for six years from and after the date of the filing of such attested statement. If an action be brought to enforce such lien within that time, the same shall continue in force until the final adjudication thereof; and there shall be no homestead or other exemption against any lien under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n'Sec. 3185a. In all cases where the labor, material, or machinery referred to in  3184 and 3185 shall be furnished by any person other than the original contractor with such \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n owner, or his agent or trustee, the lien shall not exceed the actual value of the labor, material, or machinery so furnished, and the aggregate amount of liens for which the property may be held shall not, in the absence of fraud or collusion between the owner and original contractor, exceed the amount of the price agreed upon between the owner and original contractor for the performing of such labor and the furnishing of such material and machinery: Provided, if it shall be made to appear that the owner and contractor, for the purpose of defrauding subcontractors, material men, or laborers, fixed an unreasonably low price in the original contract for any work or material for which a lien is given under  3184, the court shall ascertain the difference between such fraudulent contract price and a fair and reasonable price therefor, and such subcontractors, material men, and laborers shall have a lien to the amount of such fair and reasonable price so ascertained.' 91 Ohio Laws, 135, 137.\n\n The contention of the hotel company is that the statute under which Jones & Laughlins, Limited, proceeded was repugnant to the Constitution of Ohio; and that the supreme court of Ohio having held in two cases-Palmer v. Tingle, and Young v. Lion Hardware Co. 55 Ohio St. 423, 45 N. E. 313, determined before the bringing of this suit, but after the rights of the parties had been fixed by their contracts-that the statute was inconsistent with the state Constitution, the duty of the Federal court was to follow those decisions, even if, in the exercise of an independent judgment on the subject, it was of opinion that the statute was constitutional. Is that view in harmony with the decisions of this court?\n The leading case on this subject is Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 365, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, 21. In that case, which was in the circuit court of the United States, the rights of the parties depended upon a statute of Missouri which had not been construed by the highest court of the state at the time those rights accrued under it; and the question arose whether the circuit court was entitled to determine for itself what was the true meaning \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n of the statute. In view of some differences in forms of expression in previous cases, the court deemed it wise to re-examine the subject upon both principle and authority, and to announce the rule by which a circuit court of the United States should be guided in case of a conflict of opinion between it and the highest court of the state as to the meaning and legal effect of a local statute upon which the rights of parties depended.\n In that case Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the unanimous judgment of this court, said: 'The Federal courts have an independent jurisdiction in the administration of state laws, co-ordinate with, and not subordinate to, that of the state courts, and are bound to exercise their own judgment as to the meaning and effect of those laws. The existence of two co- ordinate jurisdictions in the same territory is peculiar, and the results would be anomalous and inconvenient but for the exercise of mutual respect and deference. Since the ordinary administration of the law is carried on by the state courts, it necessarily happens that, by the course of their decisions, certain rules are established which become rules of property and action in the state, and have all the effect of law, and which it would be wrong to disturb. This is especially true with regard to the law of real estate and the construction of state constitutions and statutes. Such established rules are always regarded by the Federal courts, no less than by the state courts themselves, as authoritative declarations of what the law is. But where the law has not been thus settled, it is the right and duty of the Federal courts to exercise their own judgment; as they also always do in reference to the doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence. So, when contracts and transactions have been entered into, and rights have accrued thereon under a particular state of the decisions, or when there has been no decision of the state tribunals, the Federal courts properly claim the right to adopt their own interpretation of the law applicable to the case, although a different interpretation may be adopted by the state courts after such rights have accrued. \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 544]\n\u00a0\n But even in such cases, for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the Federal courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts if the question seems to them balanced with doubt. Acting on these principles, founded as they are on comity and good sense, the courts of the United States, without sacrificing their own dignity as independent tribunals, endeavor to avoid, and in most cases do avoid, any unseemly conflict with well-considered decisions of the state courts. As, however, the very object of giving to the national courts jurisdiction to administer the laws of the states in controversies between citizens of different states was to institute independent tribunals which it might be supposed would be unaffected by local prejudices and sectional views, it would be a dereliction of their duty not to exercise an independent judgment in cases not foreclosed by previous adjudication.'\n So in Carroll County v. Smith, \n111 U.S. 556\n, 28 L. ed. 517, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539, in which the principal question was as to the validity, under the Constitution of Mississippi, of certain proceedings taken under a railroad charter, the supreme court of that state having passed on the question, it was contended that its judgment was binding on the courts of the United States. But this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Matthews, said: 'It was not a rule previously established, so as to have become recognized as settled law, and which, of course, all parties to transactions afterwards entered into would be presumed to know and to conform to. When, therefore, it is presented for application by the courts of the United States, in a litigation growing out of the same facts, or which they have jurisdiction by reason of the citizenship of the parties, the plaintiff has a right, under the Constitution of the United States, to the independent judgment of those courts, to determine for themselves what is the law of the state, by which his rights are fixed and governed. It was to that very end that the Constitution granted to citizens of one state, suing in another, the choice of resorting to a Federal tribunal. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 365, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10.' And in Anderson v. Santa Anna Twp. \n116 \nU.S. 356, 365\n, 29 S. L. ed. 633, 636, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413, 418, it was \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 545]\n\u00a0\n distinctly adjudged that where rights have accrued under a state constitution or statute, 'before the state court has announced its construction, the Federal courts, although leaning to an agreement with the state court, must determine the question upon their own independent judgment.' In Pleasant Twp. v. AEtna L. Ins. Co. \n138 \nU.S. 67, 72\n, 34 S. L. ed. 864, 867, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 215, where the rights of one of the parties depended upon the validity of a statute of Ohio, and which statute the supreme court of Ohio had held after the rights of the parties had accrued, under their contract, to be in violation of the Constitution of that state, this court, although reaching the same conclusion as that announced by the state court, took care to say that the decision of the state court did not conclude this court, and that concurrence with the views expressed by the state court was the result of the exercise of its independent judgment; citing Burgess v. Seligman as having settled the law upon this subject.\n In Folsom v. Township Ninety-Six, \n159 \nU.S. 611, 627\n, 40 S. L. ed. 278, 283, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, 178, which involved a question of the validity of a state enactment, this court referred to Burgess v. Seligman, and, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, said: 'There not being shown to have been a single decision of the state court against the constitutionality of the act of 1885 before the plaintiff purchased his bonds, nor any settled course of decision upon the subject, even since his purchase, the question of the validity of these bonds must be determined by this court according to its own view of the law of South Carolina.' In Barnum v. Okolona, \n148 U.S. 393\n, 37 L. ed. 495, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638, which involved the validity of certain bonds, and which bonds the highest court of the state had adjudged to be void under a local statute, the court said: 'As against a party who became the owner of such bonds before the decision of the supreme court of the state was rendered, which was the case here, we do not consider ourselves bound by such decision unless we regard it as intrinsically sound.' As late as Stanly County v. Coler, \n190 \nU.S. 437, 445\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1126, 1132, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811, relating to the validity of certain municipal bonds, this court reaffirmed the same prin- \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 546]\n\u00a0\n ciples. To the same effect are other cases which will be found cited in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals in this case when it was first before that court. Jones v. Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. 30 C. C. A. 108, 58 U. S. App. 397, 86 Fed. 370. The only exception to the general rule announced in the above cases arises when the question is whether a particular statute was passed by the legislature in the manner prescribed by the state Constitution, so as to become a law of the state. South Ottawa v. Perkins, \n94 U.S. 260\n, 24 L. ed. 154; Post v. Kendall County, \n105 U.S. 667\n, 26 L. ed. 1204; Wilkes County v. Coler, \n180 \nU.S. 506, 520\n, 45 S. L. ed. 642, 650, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458.\n The plaintiffs insist that the supreme court of Ohio, in Scioto Valley R. Co. v. Cronin, 38 Ohio St. 122, 43 Am. Rep. 419. and Scioto Valley R. Co. v. McCoy, 42 Ohio St. 251-which were determined prior to the contract between McClain and the plaintiffs-announced principles which, being applied here, would sustain the validity of the act of 1894. If this were true, then, in conformity with the settled course of decisions in this court, we should hold that the rights of the plaintiffs under their contract could not be affected by a change of decision in the state court. But, as the circuit court of appeals held, the two cases just referred to should not control the decision here. Those cases, it is true, related to statutes giving liens to those who performed labor and furnished materials in the construction of railroads. But it does not appear that any question was raised or determined in them as to the constitutionality of the particular statutes there involved.\n On behalf of the hotel company, it is contended that the cases of Hampson v. State, 8 Ohio, 315, Copeland v. Manton, 22 Ohio St. 398, Dunn v. Rankin, 27 Ohio St. 132, and Bullock v. Horn, 44 Ohio St. 420, 7 N. E. 737, all prior to the act of 1894, announced general principles which, being accepted, would necessarily lead to the conclusion reached by the supreme court of Ohio in the two subsequent cases, above cited, in which  3184 of that act was held to be in violation of the state Constitution. It is, therefore, contended that our interpretation of the Con- \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 547]\n\u00a0\n stitution of Ohio should be controlled by the rule stated in O'Brien v. Wheelock, 37 C. C. A. 309, 95 Fed. 883, 905, which involved the validity of certain municipal bonds as well as the validity of a statute of Illinois passed in 1871, the Illinois Constitution then in force being the one adopted in 1870. In that case the court observed that the Illinois act of 1871 not having been construed by the supreme court of Illinois before the bonds there in question were issued, it was its duty, under the rule announced in Burgess v. Seligman, to exercise an independent judgment as to the validity of that act under the state Constitution. But in so doing the court said two principles should not be overlooked, namely: '(1) That, although the act of 1871 may not have been expressly the subject of judicial construction before the rights of the plaintiffs accrued, this court should give effect to any rules of construction that may have been previously established by the highest court of the state when interpreting similar provisions in the Constitution of 1848; (2) that the Federal courts, for the sake of harmony, and to avoid confusion, should 'lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts, if the question seems to them balanced with doubt,' and endeavor to avoid 'any unseemly conflict with the well-considered decisions of the state courts' upon questions of local law.' We have already shown that it was the duty of the Federal court to lean to an agreement with the state court, and we recognize it to be equally its duty, when the rights of parties depend upon the construction of a state constitution, to give effect to any settled rules for construing that instrument which had been announced by the highest court of the state before such rights accrued. The difficulty in applying this principle here is that, prior to the two cases in 55 Ohio St., the supreme court of Ohio had not, we think, established any rules of constitutional construction that would necessarily require us to hold the act of 1894 to be unconstitutional.\n In our opinion, neither the decisions of Palmer v. Tingle, and Young v. Lion Hardware Co. 55 Ohio St. 423, 45 N. E. 313, nor any \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 548]\n\u00a0\n other case in the supreme court of Ohio, precluded the circuit court from exercising its independent judgment as to the constitutionality of the statute of Ohio here in question. If, prior to the making of the contracts between the plaintiffs and McClain, the state court had adjudged that the statute in question was in violation of the state Constitution, it would have been the duty of the circuit court, and equally the duty of this court, whatever the opinion of either court as to the proper construction of that instrument, to accept such prior decision as determining the rights of the parties accruing thereafter. But the decision of the state court, as to the constitutionality of the statute in question, having been rendered after the rights of parties to this suit had been fixed by their contracts, the circuit court would have been derelict in duty if it had not exercised its independent judgment touching the validity of the statute here in question. In making this declaration we must not be understood as at all qualifying the principle that, in all cases, it is the duty of the Federal court to lean to an agreement with the state court, where the issue relates to matters depending upon the construction of the constitution or laws of the state.\n It remains to dispose of the question of the constitutionality of the Ohio statute upon which this suit is based. In its consideration of the subject, the supreme court of Ohio, in the Palmer-Young Cases, referred to the preamble to the Constitution of that state, declaring that 'We, the people of the state of Ohio, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare, do establish this constitution;' to the 1st section of the Ohio Bill of Rights, providing that 'all men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and seeking and obtaining happiness and safety;' and to the 2d section of the state Constitution declaring that 'all political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 549]\n\u00a0\n and benefit.' It then said: 'The usual and most frequent means of acquiring propety is by contract, and one of the most valuable and sacred rights is the right to make and enforce contracts. The obligation of a contract, when made and entered into, cannot be impaired by act of the general assembly.' In view of these constitutional provisions, aided by the general rules of law, the state court held the statute to be unconstitutional and void, so far as it gave (syllabus) 'a lien on the property of the owner to subcontractors, laborers, and those who furnish machinery, material, or tile to the contractor;' that 'all to whom the contractor becomes indebted in the performance of his contract are bound by the terms of the contract between him and the owner.' 55 Ohio St. 423, 45 N. E. 313.\n The circuit court of appeals expressed its earnest desire, in the interest of harmony of decision, to come to an agreement with the state court, but its sense of duty compelled it to sustain the constitutional validity of the statute upon which the plaintiffs based their claim. Upon a careful consideration of the objections urged to the statute, and after an extended review of the authorities, the circuit court of appeals held that the statute did not deprive the owner of his property without due process of law, nor unreasonably interfere with his liberty of contract; that the restraints put upon the owner by the provisions in favor of sub- contractors and those who furnished materials to be used by the contractor in execution of his contract with the owner was neither arbitrary nor oppressive; that such provisions were no more onerous than required by the necessity of protecting those who actually do the work or furnish the material by which the owner is benefited; and that, as the legislation in question was sanctioned by the dictates of natural justice, and, as must be conclusively presumed, was known to the owner when he contracted for the building of his house, its requirements could only be avoided by pointing out some specific part of the organic law which has been violated by its enactment.\n We are constrained to withhold our assent to the views \n\n[193 U.S. 532, 550]\n\u00a0\n expressed by the supreme court of Ohio, and to express our concurrence with the circuit court of appeals. The great weight of authority in this country as to the meaning and scope of constitutional provisions substantially like those to be found in the Constitution of Ohie is, in our opinion, against the conclusion reached by the learned state court. Exercising an independent judgment on the subject, we are obliged to so declare. The reasons in support of the constitutionality of the statute are cogently stated in the able and elaborate opinion of Judge Lurton, speaking for the circuit court of appeals in this case. Jones v. Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. 30 C. C. A. 108, 58 U. S. App. 397, 86 Fed. 371. As the reports of the decisions of the circuit court of appeals are accessible to all, we will not encumber this opinion with a restatement of the grounds, so fully set forth by that court, on which the validity of the statute must be sustained. We content ourselves with referring to its opinion, and with citing in the margin some authorities which, in our judgment, support the views expressed by the circuit court of appeals. It results that the decree must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice White did not hear the argument, and took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n Van Stone v.

Upon examination of the record it appears that the sole evidence of infringement was found in the deposition of the president of the Hanks Dental Association, the plaintiff in error, taken pursuant to an order of the circuit court under  870 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state of New York, the defendant in error contending the examination of a party before trial, if permitted by the law of the state, is authorized by act of Congress of March 9, 1892. 27 Stat. at L. 7, chap. 14 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 664).\n\n'The taking of the deposition was objected to at every stage, and when offered in evidence at the trial it was again duly objected to, and to its reception the plaintiff in error duly excepted.\n\n'Whether this practice is warranted or not is the question upon which we desire the instructions of the Supreme Court.\n\n'Question Certified.\n\n'Upon the facts above set out the question of law concerning which the court desires the instruction of the Supreme Court is:\n\n'Was the order of the circuit court directing the president of the Hanks Dental Association, the defendant in that court, to appear before a master or commissioner appointed pursuant to the provisions of  870 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state of New York, valid and authorized under the act of March 9, 1892?' \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 305]\n\u00a0\n Philip B. Adams, Charles K. Offield, and Charles C. Linthicum for the Hanks Dental Association.\n\n Mr. Walter D. Edmonds for the International Tooth Crown Company.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Section 870 of the Code of Civil procedure of New York provides that 'the deposition of a party to an action pending in a court of record, or of a person who expects to be a party to an action about to be brought , . . . may be taken at his own instance or at the instance of an adverse party or of a coplaintiff or codefendant at any time before the trial, as prescribed in this article.' And succeeding sections set forth how such examinations may be ordered.\n In Ex parte Fisk, \n113 U.S. 713\n, 28 L. ed. 1117, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724, decided at October term, 1884, it was held that this statute was in conflict with  861 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), and not within any of the exceptions to the rule therein prescribed. The sections bearing on the subject were thus summarized by Mr. Justice Miller, who delivered the opinion of the court:\n\"Sec. 861. [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661]. The mode of proof, in the trial of actions at common law, shall be by oral testimony and examination of witnesses in open court, except as hereinafter provided.'\n\n\"Sec. 863 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661]. The testimony of any witness may be taken in any civil cause depending in a district or circuit court, by deposition de bene esse, when the witness lives at a greater distance from the place of trial than one hundred miles, or is bound on a voyage to sea, or is about to go out of the United States, or out of the district in which the case is to be tried, and to a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of trial, before the time of trial, or when he is ancient or infirm.' The remainder of this section, and  864 and 865 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 663], are directory as to the officer before whom the deposition may be taken, the notice to the opposite party, and the manner of taking, testifying, and returning the deposition to the court. \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 306]\n\u00a0\n \"Sec. 866 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 663]. In any case where it is necessary, in order to prevent a failure or delay of justice, any of the courts of the United States may grant a dedimus potestatem to take depositions according to common usage; and any circuit court, upon application to it as a court of equity, may, according to the usages of chancery, direct depositions to be taken in perpetuam rei memoriam, if they relate to any matters that may be cognizable in any court of the United States.'\n\n' 867 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 664] authorizes the courts of the United States, in their discretion, and according to the practice in the state courts, to admit evidence so taken; and  868, 869, and 870 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 664, 665] prescribe the manner of taking such depositions, and of the use of the subpoena duces tecum, and how it may be obtained.'\n\n Mr. Justice Miller then continued: 'No one can examine these provisions for procuring testimony to be used in the courts of the United States, and have any reasonable doubt that, so far as they apply, they were intended to provide a system to govern the practice, in that respect, in those courts. They are, in the first place, too complete, too far- reaching, and too minute to admit of any other conclusion. But we have not only this inference from the character of the legislation, but it is enforced by the express language of the law in providing a defined mode of proof in those courts, and in specifying the only exceptions to that mode which shall be admitted.'\n And he further said: 'Its purpose is clear to provide a mode of proof in trials at law, to the exclusion of all other modes of proof.' 'It is not according to common usage to call a party in advance of the trial at law, and to subject him to all the skill of opposing counsel, to extract something which he may then use or not, as it suits his purpose.' 'Every action at law in a court of the United States must be governed by the rule or by the exceptions which the statute provides. There is no place for exceptions made by state statutes. The court is not at liberty to adopt them, or to require a party to conform to them. It has no power to subject a party to such an examination as this.' \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n Sections 721 and 914 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 581 and 684) were held inapplicable because the law of the state was inconsistent with the law of Congress. And see Beardsley v. Littell, 14 Blatchf, 102, Fed. Cas. No. 1,185, Blatchford, J.; United States v. Pings, 4 Fed. 714, Choate, J.; Fogg v. Fisk, 22 Blatchf. 29, 19 Fed. 235, Wallace, J.; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co. \n147 \nU.S. 337, 338\n, 37 S. L. ed. 194, 195, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356.\n In Union P. R. Co. v. Botsford, \n141 U.S. 250\n, 35 L. ed. 734, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1000, decided at October term, 1890, the question was whether a court of the United States could order a plaintiff, in an action for an injury to the person, to submit to a surgical examination in advance of the trial, and it was held that it could not.\n Mr. Justice Gray, among other things, said: 'Congress has enacted that 'the mode of proof in the trial of actions at common law shall be by oral testimony and examination of witnesses in open court, except as hereinafter provided,' and has then made special provisions for taking depositions. Rev. Stat.  861, 863 et seq. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661). The only power of discovery or inspection, conferred by Congress, is to 'require the parties to produce books or writings in their possession or power, which contain evidence pertinent to the issue, in cases and under circumstances where they might be compelled to produce the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery,' and to nonsuit or default a party failing to comply with such an order. Rev. Stat.  724 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583). And the provision of  914 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684), by which the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in the courts of each state are to be followed in actions at law in the courts of the United States held within the same state, neither restricts nor enlarges the power of these courts to order the examination of parties out of court.'\n Ex parte Fisk was quoted from and applied, and the opinion concluded: 'The order moved for, subjecting the plaintiff's person to examination by a surgeon, without her consent, and in advance of the trial, was not according to the common law, to common usage, or to the statutes of the United States. The circuit court, to adopt the words of Mr. Justice Miller, \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 308]\n\u00a0\n 'has no power to subject a party to such an examination as this.\"\n March 9, 1892, the following act was approved (27 Stat. at L. 7, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 664): 'Chap. 14. An Act to Provide an Additional Mode of Taking Depositions of Witnesses in Causes Pending in the Courts of the United States. Be it enacted, . . . That in addition to the mode of taking depositions of witnesses in causes pending at law or equity in the district and circuit courts of the United States, it shall be lawful to take the depositions or testimony of witnesses in the mode prescribed by the laws of the state in which the courts are held.'\n Mode usually means the manner in which a thing is done, and this act relates to the manner of taking 'depositions and testimony,' which the title treats as equivalent terms, and which may be so regarded so faras the question before us is concerned. But it is contended that the word 'mode' as used in the act has a broader significance, and embraces the production of evidence, thereby qualifying  861 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), which prescribes the mode of proof.\n We cannot concur in this view. The act is clear upon its face, and does not call for construction, or, at all events, is susceptible of but one construction. It does not purport to repeal in any part or to modify,  861 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), or to create additional exceptions to those specified in the subsequent sections by enlarging the causes or grounds for taking depositions, and as it is applicable alone to the taking of depositions or testimony in writing, we cannot attribute to it any such effect, nor hold, this being so, that it is supplementary to  914 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684).\n That section refers to 'the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes,' and Mr. Justice Blatchford, then district judge, in Beardsley v. Littell, thought the expression 'forms and modes of proceeding' did not necessarily include the subject of evidence. But be that as it may, we do not think the words 'mode of taking' were used in this act with the intention of expanding the scope of \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 309]\n\u00a0\n the section so as to cover the production of testimony through the examination of a party before trial.\n In short, the courts of the United States are not given discretion to take depositions not authorized by Federal law, but, in respect of depositions thereby authorized to be taken, they may follow the Federal practice in the manner of taking, or that provided by the state law. United States v. 50 Boxes & Packages of Lace, 92 Fed. 601.\n In National Cash-Register v. Leland, 77 Fed. 242, it was ruled by the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts that the act of 1892 did not 'enlarge the instances in which depositions may be taken or in which answers may be obtained upon interrogatories, for use as proof in the Federal courts;' and 'was only intended to simplify the taking of depositions by providing that the mode of taking in instances authorized by the Federal laws, might conform to the mode prescribed by the laws of the state in which Federal courts were held;' and this was approved by the circuit court of appeals for the first circuit. 37 C. C. A. 372, 94 Fed. 502. The conclusions announced by the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Wilder, 35 C. C. A. 105, 92 Fed. 953, and by the circuit court for the district of Kansas in Shellabarger v. Oliver, 64 Fed. 306; for the district court of Indiana in Tobor v. Indianapolis Journal Newspaper Co. 66 Fed. 423; for the western district of Missouri in Seeley v. Kansas City Star Co. 71 Fed. 556; for the eastern district of Pennsylvania in Despeaux v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 81 Fed. 897; for the eastern district of Missouri in Zych v. American Car & Foundry Co. 127 Fed. 728,-are to the same effect. The decision of the circuit court in this case is to the contrary (101 Fed. 306), and was concurred in by the circuit court for the northern district of Washington in Smith v. Northern P. R. Co. 110 Fed. 341.\n In Camden & Suburban R. Co. v. Stetson, \n177 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 721, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617, October term, 1899, the question of the power of \n\n[194 U.S. 303, 310]\n\u00a0\n the circuit court for the district of New Jersey, under a statute of New Jersey providing therefor, was under consideration, and the power sustained. The validity of the statute had been affirmed by the supreme court of New Jersey, and in the course of the opinion of this court it was said: 'The validity of a statute of this nature has also been upheld in Lyon v. Manhattan R. Co. 142 N. Y. 298, 25 L. R. A. 402, 37 N. E. 113, although the particular form of that statute would probably be regarded as conflicting with the law of Congress in relation to the examination of a party as a witness before trial, and hence might not be enforced in courts of the United States, sitting within the state of New York.'\n Section 873 of the New York Code of Procedure provided that 'in every action to recover damages for personal injuries, the court or judge, in granting an order for the examination of the plaintiff before trial, may, if the defendant apply therefor, direct that the plaintiff submit to a physical examination;' and in Lyon v. Manhattan R. Co., the court of appeals held that the physical examination could only 'be procured in the same way and as part of the examination of the party before trial;' that it could not be had apart from, and independent of, the examination before trial. The reference to the New York statute in Camden & Suburban R. Co. v. Stetson, so far as it goes, indicates the opinion of the court that the ruling in Ex parte Fisk remained unaffected by the act of March 9, 1892, in any substantial particular. We think that that ruling applies, and that the question must be answered in the negative.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARDING v. STATE OF ILLINOIS(1904)\nNo. 61\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. William H. Barnum for plaintiff in error.[ Harding v. State of Illinois \n196 U.S. 78\n (1904) ]\n\n\n[196 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert S. Iles, Robert D. Martin, and Stillman B. Jamieson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was submitted on briefs, together with motion to dismiss or affirm. In support of the motion to dismiss, the position taken is that no Federal question was properly raised in the state court, and therefore none is reviewable here.\n The case was commenced in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, to recover taxes for the years 1897, 1898, 1899, and 1900, on a block of land in the Elston addition to the city of Chicago. At the trial a jury was waived, and, upon hearing, a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $2,123.05. An inspection of the record shows that the principal controversy was over the effect of a deed made by Harding, the plaintiff in error, to the Chicago Real Estate Loan & Trust Company, dated June 10, 1896, and recorded July 2 of the same year, which conveyed, for the consideration of $5, 'all interest in the following described real estate, to wit: Any and all lands, if every kind and description, claimed or owned by me in the state of Illinois, and all lots and lands, of every description, in the city of Chicago, in which I have any right, title, or interest whatsoever, situated in the state of Illinois,' etc. It was the contention of the state that this deed was too general in its terms to convey specific property, and was therefore insufficient notice to the taxing officer of Cook county that the ownership of the property had changed. The trial court admitted this deed in evidence, subject to this objection. Upon appeal to the supreme court of Illinois, of this deed and other evidence in the case that court said:\n'Conceding that the deed, if it stood alone, would overcome the prima facie case made by the plaintiff, the tax records of Cook county for the year 1898, offered in evidence by the people, tended to prove ownership in the defendant. The items in the tax warrant for the year 1897 on this property were charged to him and merged into a judgment. He ap- \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n peared in the county court and objected to the validity of the tax, but judgment was rendered against him as owner. This was subsequent to the date of the deed. His remedy as to that tax, if levied unjustly against him, was by appeal. Biggins v. People, 106 Ill. 270. As to that tax he clearly could not, in this proceeding, attack the validity of the former judgment. Moreover, after the date of the deed he received the rents accruing from the property and deposited the money so received to his personal account. Notwithstanding the attempted explanation of that transaction, we think the weight of the evidence is that he continued, after the pretended conveyance, to deal with the premises as his own.\n\n'In the light of all the evidence in the case it is very clear that the conveyance of June 10, 1896, was merely colorable, and not executed with the honest purpose of conveying the absolute ownership of the property to the grantee.' 202 Ill. 122, 66 N. E. 962.\n\n Much of the elaborate brief of the counsel for plaintiff in error is devoted to a discussion of alleged errors of the supreme court of Illinois in deciding questions which, it is alleged, were not properly made, or in failing to give due weight to matters of evidence in the record. This court has no general power to review or correct the decisions of the highest state court, and in cases if this character exercises a statutory jurisdiction to protect alleged violations, in state decisions, of certain rights arising under Federal authority. Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 U.S. 103\n, 40 L. ed. 91, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80: Marchant v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n153 U.S. 380\n, 38 L. ed. 751, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 894.\n The proceeding was brought under  230, chapter 120, 3 Starr & C. Anno. Stat. of Illinois, 3501. This section provides:\n'In any such suit or trial for forfeited taxes, the fact that real estate or personal property is assessed to a person, firm, or corporation shall be prima facie evidence that such person, firm, or corporation was the owner thereof, and liable for the taxes for the year or years for which the assessment was made, and such fact may be proved by the introduction in evidence \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n of the proper assessment book or roll, or other competent proof.'\n\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error in this court that this statute is unconstitutional, permitting assessment of those who may not be the owners of the property assessed, and consequently a violation of the protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The adverse holding in the state court upon this proposition is the decision upon a Federal right which, it is asserted, gives jurisdiction to review the judgment in this court. The motion to dismiss raises the question whether this objection was properly reserved in the state court. Upon the constitutionality of this act the supreme court of Illinois said:\n'It is also said that the foregoing section of the statute, under which the action is brought, is unconstitutional; but no authorities are cited or argument advanced in support of that assertion. The point, if it can be so considered, has therefore been waived.'\n\n In the petition for allowance of a writ of error, and the assignment of errors in this court, it is alleged that the supreme court of the state erred in holding that the constitutional objection had been waived. And the plaintiff in error appears to have put upon file here, without leave, the briefs and petition for rehearing below, in which it is insisted there is sufficient to show that the constitutional objection was not abandoned. But neither the petition for a rehearing or petition for writ of error in the state court after judgment, or assignments of error in this court, can supply deficiencies in the record of the state court, if any exist. Simmerman v. Nebraska, \n116 U.S. 54\n, 29 L. ed. 535, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333. Nor does the certification of the briefs by the clerk of the state supreme court, which are no part of the record, help the matter. Zadig v. Baldwin, \n166 U.S. 485\n, 41 L. ed. 1087, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639. We are to try the case upon the duly certified record, legally made in the state court, and upon which its decision rests. Powell v. Brunswick County, \n150 \nU.S. 433, 439\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1134, 1136, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166.\n An examination of the record discloses that the assignment \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n of errors in the supreme court of Illinois does not directly raise the point under consideration. It is referred to in the following language of the assignment of errors:\n'The finding and judgment of the court were erroneous for the several reasons stated in the points filed in support of the motion to set aside the finding and grant a new trial.'\n\n If we may look to the motion filed in the trial court we find some thirty points assigned as grounds for a new trial. Those which may have application to Federal constitutional questions are found in paragraphs 26 and 27, which are:\n'26. The statute under which this action is prosecuted is contrary to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'27. This proceeding under said statute is a taking of property without due process of law, and otherwise unconstitutional.'\n\n The assertion that a judgment rests upon an unconstitutional state statute, the validity of which has been drawn in question and sustained, presents one of a class of cases which may be reviewed here. In the analysis of  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575) in Columbia Water Power Co. v. Columbia Electric Street R. Light & P. Co. \n172 U.S. 475\n-488, 43 L. ed. 521-526, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247-252, it was pointed out that cases of the character of the one now under consideration come within the second class of those provided for in the section: 'Where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under, any state on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.'\n It has been frequently held that in cases coming within this class less particularity is required in asserting the Federal right than in cases in the third class, wherein a right, title, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the United States, and the decision is against such right, title, privilege, or immunity. In the latter class the statute requires such right or privilege to be 'specially set up and claimed.' Under the second class it may be said to be the result of the rulings in this court that if \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n the Federal question appears in the record in the state court and was decided, or the decision thereof was necessarily involved in the case, the fact that it was not specially set up will not preclude the right of review here. Columbia Water Power Co. v. Columbia Electric Street R. Light & P. Co. \n172 U.S. 475\n, 43 L. ed. 521, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247, and cases cited on p. 488, L. ed. p. 526, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 252. Nevertheless, it is equally well settled that the right of review dependent upon the adverse decision of a Federal question exists only in those cases wherein a decision of the question involved was brought, in some proper manner, to the attention of the court, and decided, or it appears that the judgment rendered could not have been given without deciding it. Fowler v. Lamson, \n164 U.S. 252\n, 41 L. ed. 424, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112; Clarke v. McDade, \n165 U.S. 168\n-172, 41 L. ed. 673, 674, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 284. In one of the latest utterances of this court upon the question under consideration ( Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 U.S. 238\n-248, 46 L. ed. 171-176, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 120-124), Mr. Justice White, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'It is settled that this court, on error to a state court, cannot consider an alleged Federal question when it appears that the Federal right thus relied upon had not been, by adequate specification, called to the attention of the state court, and had not been by it considered, not being necessarily involved in the determination of the cause. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. v. Patten Paper Co. \n172 \nU.S. 58, 67\n, 43 S. L. ed. 364, 368, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 97; F. G. Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, \n166 \nU.S. 648, 654\n, 655 S., 41 L. ed. 1149, 1151, 1152, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709, and cases cited. Now, the only possible support to the claim that a Federal question on the subject under consideration was raised below was the general statement in the answer to which we have already adverted, that 'this proceeding is in violation of the Constitution of the United States.' Nowhere does it appear that at any time was any specification made as to the particular clause of the Constitution relied upon to establish that the granting of relief by quo warranto would be repugnant to that Constitution, nor is there anything in the record which could give rise even to a remote inference that the mind of the state court was directed to or considered this question. On the contrary, it is apparent from the record that such a contention was not \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n raised in the state court. Thus, although at the request of the defendant below (the plaintiff in error here) the state court certified as to the existence of the Federal questions which had been called to its attention and which it had decided, no reference was made in the certificate to the claim of Federal right we are now considering.'\n\n The only authority called to the attention of this court by counsel for plaintiff in error as supporting the view that a Federal question was properly raised in this case is Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 587, in which case it was contended that a statute of the state of Illinois, under which condemnation proceedings were had, was in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In that case it was distinctly asserted, in the motion for a new trial in the trial court, that the statute and rulings of the court, and the verdict and judgment based thereon, were contrary to the 14th Amendment, declaring that no state should deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its limits the equal protection of the laws. In the assignment of errors in the supreme court of the state it was distinctly reasserted that these Federal rights had been denied by the proceedings in the trial court, and it was held in this court that while the supreme court of Illinois did not, in its ipinion, expressly refer to the Federal constitutional rights asserted, the same were necessarily included in the judgment of the court, and therefore the case was reviewable here. But how stands the present case? It is distinctly stated by the supreme court of Illinois (whose judgment is alone reviewable here) in the passage above quoted from its opinion, that no authorities were cited nor agrument advanced in support of the assertion that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the point, if it could otherwise be considered, was deemed to be waived. If we look to the motion for a new trial, referred to in general terms in the assignment of errors when the case was taken to the supreme court of Illinois, we find the only \n\n[196 U.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n reference to a Federal constitutional question to be in paragraphs 26 and 27, above quoted, from the motion for new trial in the court of original jurisdiction. Paragraph 26 simply states that the statute is contrary to the Constitution of the United States, without calling attention to the provision of that instrument whose protection is denied to the plaintiff in error, and is clearly insufficient. Farney v. Towle, 1 Black, 350, 17 L. ed. 216. Paragraph 27 alleges that the statute takes the property without due process of law, and is therefore unconstitutional. If this vague objection ( 27) may be taken as asserting a claim of right under the Federal Constitution, yet, in the supreme court of Illinois, so far as the record discloses, there was neither authority cited nor argument advanced in support of the constitutional objection. There is nothing to prevent a party from waiving a Federal right of this character if he chooses to do so, either in express terms or as a necessary implication from his manner of proceeding in the cause. It is clear from the opinion cited that the state court based its decision upon other than Federal grounds, and did not decide the constitutional question sought to be made here.\n If the question was necessarily decided, notwithstanding the failure or refusal of the state court to expressly and in terms pass upon the matter, the case might be brought here. But in this case the state court expressly disclaims decision of the constitutional question, because it was not presented by proper proceedings. Our view of this record is that, in so holding, the state court did not err to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTIGAN v. U S(1904)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1904\n\n\n Appellant filed a petition in the court of claims to have declared void his dismissal from the United States Military Academy at West Point, and for judgment for his pay as a cadet from July 27, 1883, to July 1, 1889, amounting to $3,417.\n The appellant was duly appointed a cadet in the Military Academy on the 1st day of July, 1880, and served as such until the 27th of July, 1883, when he was summarily dismissed, by order of the President, upon charges of maltreating a new cadet upon guard, as well as other improper conduct. After the dismissal of appellant another cadet was appointed to succeed him, was duly graduated from the Academy, and appointed and commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army, and subsequently a captain of the Twenty- fifth Regiment of Infantry.\n The appellant, subsequently to his dismissal, presented petitions respectively to the Adjutant General of the Army and to the Secretary of War, in which he asserted his innocence of the charges made against him, and prayed for reinstatement or trial by court-martial. He also presented a petition April 21, 1888, to the President, asking for a revocation of the order of dismissal, a trial by court-martial, and for an order assigning and appointing him to the Army as of the date of the assignment of the last graduate of his class. The petitions were all denied.\n The court of claims held that he was not entitled to recover, and dismissed his petition. 38 Ct. Cl. 346. \n\n[196 U.S. 169, 170]\n\u00a0\n L. T. Michener and W. W. Dudley for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. George M. Anderson for appellee.\n\n\n\n[196 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention of appellant is that, as a cadet, he was an officer in the Army, within the meaning of  1229 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 868, and could only have been dismissed from the Academy upon trial and conviction by court-martial, as provided in that section.\n That section provides as follows: 'The President is authorized to drop from the rolls of the Army for desertion any officer who is absent from duty three months without leave; and no officer so dropped shall be eligible for reappointment. And no officer in the military or naval service shall in time of peace be dismissed from service, except upon and in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof.'\n In the Articles of War, enacted by  1342 of the Revised Statutes, the word 'commutation' is changed to 'mitigation.' Art. 99, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 967.\n The first impression of claimant's contention is that it ignores obvious distinctions, and makes a state of preparation for a position the same as the position itself, and claims its \n\n[196 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n sanction for one who is not bearing its responsibilities or capable of discharging its duties. And an examination of the Revised Statutes relating to the organization of the Army confirms the impression.\n Manifestly, it is impossible to reproduce all the sections of the Revised Statutes applicable to the military establishment, and we will only observe that they distinguish between the Army proper and the Military Academy, and make a distinction between an officer and a cadet. A few citations only are necessary.\n Title XIV. of the Revised Statutes of the United States, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 942, provides 'for the organization of the Army of the United States. The name, rank, and function of each officer is provided for, and  1213, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 854, explicitly states when a cadet shall become an officer. That section enacts that when a cadet shall have regularly graduated from the Academy he 'shall be considered a candidate for a commission in any corps for whose duties he may be deemed competent.' He then becomes a commissioned officer. Prior to that time he is denominated a cadet, appointed as a cadet, and provision made for him under that name and state. He becomes an officer when he ceases to be a cadet; that is, when he has finished his pupilage; or, as  1213 expresses it, when 'he has gone through all his classes and received a regular degree from the academic staff' and commissioned. And his government while a cadet is provided for in chapter 5 of title XIV.\n A cadet may be in the Army ( 1094, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 783), may be an officer in a certain sense, as distinguished from an enlisted man, as it is contended by counsel for the government he is, but nevertheless  1229 does not apply to him. That section is one of a number of provisions for the organization and government of the Army, distinct from, and having no relation whatever to, the provisions for the government of the Military Academy and the cadets. Section 1229 is made part of, and the word 'officer' given exact definition by,  1342, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 944, which provides as follows: \n\n[196 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 1342. The armies of the United States shall be governed by the following rules and articles: The word 'officer,' as used therein, shall be understood to designate commissioned officers; the word 'soldier' shall be understood to include noncommissioned officers, musicians, artificers, and privates, and other enlisted men, and the convictions mentioned therein shall be understood to be convictions by court-martial.'\n By article 99 it is enacted:\n'No officer shall be discharged or dismissed from the service except by order of the President or by sentence of a general court-martial; and in time of peace no officer shall be dismissed except in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial or in mitigation thereof.'\n\n It is only a commissioned officer, therefore, who is entitled to the protection of a general court-martial, and a cadet is not a commissioned officer.\n The argument of appellant, contending against this construction of the statute, is not easy to reproduce or make clear, and it involves the anomaly that there can be an officer in the Army of the United States who is not covered by the Articles of War, notwithstanding the declaration of  1342, that the Armies of the United States shall be governed by those articles.\n The object of the argument is to make independent  1229 of  1342, and to give a cadet the protection expressed by the former, on the ground that a cadet is an officer, but not a commissioned officer. That a cadet is an officer is deduced from the fact that he is appointed by the President, takes an oath to obey his 'superior officers,' and receives pay. But, as we have already intimated, it is not necessary to dispute that a cadet is an officer. Whether he is or not is not the question in the case. The question is whether  1229 applies to him, and to so construe it would seemingly give it no application except to cadets (and officers in the naval service), and transfer it from the government of the Army to the government of the Academy; and, we may ob- \n\n[196 U.S. 169, 174]\n\u00a0\n serve, would render the distinction implied by it between a time of peace and a time of war almost meaningless. It is nevertheless contended by appellant that  1229 is unaffected by  1342 and the Articles of War, but is a part of  1326, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 934, which gives the superintendent of the Academy the power to convene general courts-martial for the trial of cadets. In other words, the contention is that  1326 is not merely a grant of power to the superintendent of the Academy to convene courts-martial for the trial of cadets, but commands him to do so, and, it would seem, necessarily, for every infraction of discipline. What, it may be asked, under the contention of appellant, is the relation between  1326 and  1325, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 933, 934? By the latter section there can be deficiency in studies as well as conduct. Can there be no discharge from the Academy for deficiency in studies except upon and in pursuance of a court-martial to that effect?\n The cases cited by appellant do not conflict with these views. United States v. Morton, \n112 U.S. 1\n, 28 L. ed. 613, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1, decides only that the time of service as a cadet was actual time of service in the Army within the meaning of the statutes giving longevity pay to officers. In United States v. Baker, \n125 U.S. 646\n, 31 L. ed. 824, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1022, and United States v. Cook, \n128 U.S. 254\n, 32 L. ed. 464, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108, statutes giving longevity pay to officers in the Navy were construed, and it was held that a cadet midshipman was an officer of the Navy. The reasoning of the court, however, has no application to the construction of  1229 and 1342.\n The power of the President to dismiss a delinquent cadet we do not understand is questioned, except as that power is affected by  1229 and 1342. We may, however, refer to Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 259, 10 L. ed. 152; Blake v. United States, \n103 \nU.S. 227, 236\n, 26 S. L. ed. 462, 465; Mullan v.

CITY OF HELENA(1904)\nNo. 27\nArgued: October 28, 1904Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This case was begun by a bill filed in the circuit court of the United States by the Helena Waterworks Company, successor to the Helena Consolidated Water Company, to restrain the city of Helena from erecting purchasing, or acquiring a waterworks system for said city, and from acquiring water for such purpose, except it purchase the plant of the complainant company, and from incurring any indebtedness or expenditure of money for such purpose.\n The rights in controversy are alleged to result from a contract made by the passage, and acceptance by the company, of a certain ordinance, number 248, passed and approved in January, 1890\n\n\n It is also alleged that the Helena Consolidated Water Company, predecessor of the complainant company, complied with all the terms of the ordinance, and expended large sums of money in erecting and maintaining the plant for supplying water to the inhabitants of the said city of Helena.\n It is averred that the said city has adopted certain ordinances and taken certain proceedings to acquire and build a water \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n system of its own, and that said ordinances and proceedings are in violation of the contract rights of the complainant company, guaranteed by  11 of article 3 of the Constitution of the state of Montana, and  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and that the proceedings of the city in this behalf will amount to taking the property of the complainant company without just compensation, in violation of  14 of article 3 of the Constitution of the state of Montana, and that its rights and property will be taken without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n It is further averred that the taxation necessary for the construction of the city plant is in excess of any that can be lawfully levied for such purpose.\n The case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts. In the circuit court a decision was rendered in favor of the waterworks company. Upon appeal to the circuit court of appeals that court reversed the decision of the circuit court, and remanded the case, with instructions to dismiss the bill. 58 C. C.

Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n-696, 41 L. ed. 1165-1168, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718; Joplin v. Southwestern Missouri Light Co. \n191 U.S. 150\n, 48 L. ed. 127, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43; Skaneateles Waterworks Co. v. Skaneateles, \n184 U.S. 354\n, 46 L. ed. 585, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 400. These cases hold that the grant of the franchise does not of itself raise an implied contract that the grantor will not do any act to interfere with the rights granted to the waterworks company, and that, in the absence of the grant of an exclusive privilege, none will be implied against the public, but must arise, if at all, from some specific contract, binding upon the municipality.\n As stated by appellant's counsel: 'The position taken by appellants is, that by ordinance 248 the city has precluded itself from engaging in the commercial business of furnishing water to its inhabitants. We maintain that by the contract contained in this ordinance the Helena Consolidated Water Company [predecessor of appellant] for itself, its successors, and assigns, expressly agreed to furnish water to all of the inhabitants of the city during the term of twenty years; and that by reason of the contractual obligation thus assumed by the company there is the implied promise or undertaking on the part of the city that it will not, during such period, become a competitor of appellant.' A consideration of this contention requires an examination of the sections of the ordinance pertinent to a determination of the question:\n'Sec. 1. There is hereby granted to the Helena Consolidated Water Company, and its successors and assigns, for the full term of twenty years from the passage hereof, the license and franchise of laying and maintaining water mains and pipes in and through all of the streets, alleys, avenues, and public grounds of the city of Helena for the purpose of conveying and distributing water throughout the said city, and for the \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n purpose of selling the same to all persons, bodies, or corporations within the said city desiring to purchase the same, and to said city for fire, sewerage, and other purposes, in case said city desires to purchase the same, subject, however, to the provisions of this ordinance, hereinafter contained, establishing maximum rates, and generally to have and exercise all the rights, privileges, and franchises necessary to the proper and successful furnishing of water to the inhabitants of said city if required; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to give to the said Helena Consolidated Water Company, or its successors or assigns, the exclusive right of occupying the streets, avenues, alleys, and public grounds of said city with water mains and pipes, or the exclusive right of conveying, distributing, or selling the same throughout the said city, or of furnishing the same to said city, except as hereinafter set forth.'\n\n'Sec. 3. All pipes and mains, including service pipes connected therewith, shall be laid at the depth of 5 feet below the established grade, and shall be laid under the supervision of the street commissioner of said city as to grade and location in streets; and all repairs and extensions of such pipes and mains shall be done under the supervision of said street commissioner as to grade and location in streets. Nothing contained herein shall preclude said city of Helena from regrading or changing the grade of any street or streets within said city, or from the construction or maintenance of sewer work, or other works or plants of a public nature, or from letting, giving, or granting any franchises, rights, or easements to any person or persons, corporation or corporations, whomsoever, so long as such franchises, rights, and easements do not interfere with the franchises, rights, and easements hereby granted. And that said Helena Consolidated Water Company must and shall look solely and exclusively to the person or persons, corporation or corporations, to whom such franchises, rights, and easements have been given by said city for any and all damages the said Helena Consolidated Water Company may \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n sustain by reason of any interference with any of its pipes, mains, or hydrants, or any exposure of the same caused by such person or persons, corporation or corporations.'\n\n'Sec. 6. The said Helena Consolidated Water Company shall furnish and provide a full, ample, and sufficient supply of good, pure, wholesome, and clear water for the use and wants of the inhabitants of said city, and to provide said city with water for fire, sewerage (maintenance and construction), and for other purposes; and such supply shall be full, ample, and sufficient for the present population of said city, and for the future population of the said city, as the same may be from time to time during the full term of five years; and said water shall be pure, wholesome, and free from animal, vegetable, or mineral substances, such as would render it unhealthy or unfit for domestic use.'\n\n'Sec. 26. It is hereby declared and understood to be of the essence of the agreement and the acceptance hereof that the said Helena Consolidated Water Company shall, at all times during the term of such agreement, provide all the inhabitants of the city, whatever their number may be, with a full, ample, and sufficient supply of good, pure, and wholesome and clear water, and shall convey, distribute, and sell to them upon the terms and conditions herein provided and expressed.'\n\n By  8 the company was required to provide 20 miles of mains within the limits of the city, and by  10 the company was required to lay and maintain additional mains, of such sizes, at such times, and upon such streets as the city council might, from time to time, direct. Section 17 provided that the company shall not refuse to permit connections to be made by, or to sell water to, persons offering to pay for the same.\n Section 16 of the ordinance fixes maximum rates for water to be furnished to the inhabitants of the city. Section 21 makes appropriation for the term of five years from and after January 1, 1890, of certain sums for hydrants and the use of water for the benefit of the city. By the 1st section \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n of the ordinance, the company is granted the use of the streets, alleys, and avenues and public grounds of the city for the laying and maintenance of its pipes and mains for the purpose of conveying water and selling it to those 'desiring' to purchase the same, and to the city for fire and other purposes in case the city 'desires to purchase the same.'\n Certainly, there is nothing in this section that savors of a contract beyond the obligation imposed upon the company, in consideration of the franchise and privileges granted, to furnish water at certain maximum rates to private persons or to the city, when such persons or the municipality desire to purchase the same. When we come to consider  6 we find an engagement whereby the obligation of the company to furnish water to the city is limited to the term of five years; and in  21 we find an appropriation made to cover the compensation to be paid by the city for the term of five years for the use of water for public purposes. If these sections can be construed to amount to a contract between the city and the company, binding the city to take its entire supply of water from this company for five years, which would be broken by the erection or building of a plant by the city to supply itself with water, it had expired before the beginning of this suit, and the contract, if it existed after the expiration of the term named in  6, must be found in other sections of the ordinance. The contention is that, as by  26 the water company was bound during the term of the agreement, which, it is claimed, is twenty years, to provide all the inhabitants of the city, whatever their number, with a water supply, this contract will be impaired, and its benefits to the company destroyed, if the city should erect an independent plant of its own. But, in our view, this section must be read with  1, which requires the company to furnish water to such inhabitants of the city as desire to purchase the same; and there is nothing in this agreement which binds the city to take water from the company beyond the term of five years, expressly provided in  6, and for which, upon specific \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n terms as to prices, an appropriation was made in  21. There is nothing in  26 nor in  1 undertaking to bind the inhabitants of the city to take water from the company. The city has not and, of course, could not undertake to make any contract upon the subject for the private supply of individuals in the city beyond securing a maximum rate of charge for water supplied. The engagement for their benefit requires the company, during the term of the franchise, to supply water at not exceeding certain maximum prices, which were fixed by the ordinance. Properly construed, we think this ordinance shows an agreement upon the part of the company to furnish water to the inhabitants of the city at not exceeding certain maximum rates, and to the city itself, upon terms to be agreed upon, made definite, as far as the city was concerned, for the term of five years. As thus interpreted we do not find anything in this contract that prevents the city, certainly after the expiration of five years, from constructing its own plant. It has not specifically bound itself not so to do, and, as has been frequently held in this court, nothing is to be taken against the public by implication. Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n, 41 L. ed. 1165, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 718, and cases cited in the opinion. Had it been intended to exclude the city from exercising the privilege of establishing its own plant, such purpose could have been expressed by apt words, as was the case in Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 341, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77. It is doubtless true that the erection of such a plant by the city will render the property of the water company less valuable, and perhaps, unprofitable; but if it was intended to prevent such competition, a right to do so should not have been left to argument or implication, but made certain by the terms of the contract. The right to tax within certain limits to procure a supply of water for the municipality, which shall be owned and controlled by the city, is authorized by the Constitution of Montana, article 13,  6. Paragraph 4800 of the Political Code of Montana provides for the carrying into \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 393]\n\u00a0\n effect of this constitutional power to tax for a system of waterworks to be owned and controlled by the municipality. The feature of the law requiring the purchase of existing waterworks instead of building an independent plant by the city was held unconstitutional by the supreme court of Montana in Helena Consol. Water Co. v. Steele, 20 Mont. 1, 37 L. R. A. 412, 49 Pac. 382.\n The privilege of building other works was, in the absence of some binding contract forbidding the exercise of the power, clearly within the city's constitutional and statutory rights. We cannot find that the city has precluded itself from exercising this right by anything shown in this case. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to decide whether the city's right to construct a plant of its own was expressly saved in  3 of the ordinance reserving the right to construct and maintain 'sewer work, of other works of a public nature.'\n This action is also brought by the water company as a taxpayer; and it is claimed that the city had no right to acquire a water supply and build its waterworks except by acquiring the plant of the company.\n In the findings of fact it was expressly stipulated:\n'That the city of Helena contemplates and intends to do all acts and things necessary to secure a water supply and system to be owned and controlled by the said city of Helena, and that it contemplates and intends to raise funds and revenue therefor in the manner provided by law, and to use the same for said purpose, and to furnish and supply the city of Helena and the inhabitants thereof with water from its said plant, and that it contemplates and intends to purchase and secure a sufficient quantity of water for said purpose, and that complainant does not obtain any of its water supply from either Beaver, McClellen, or Prickly Pear creeks.\n\n'That the ordinances Nos. 467 and 483, mentioned in paragraph 27 of the complainant's bill of complaint, were duly passed and adopted and approved, and that unless said defendant, the city of Helena, in enjoined and restrained from acquiring a water supply, plant, and system, it will proceed \n\n[195 U.S. 383, 394]\n\u00a0\n to acquire the same under said ordinances or such others as are necessary for said purpose, as hereinbefore stated, and will engage in furnishing the said defendant, the city of Helena, and its inhabitants, with water, suitable and proper for its use, and that to do so will depreciate the value of complainant's franchise and property, as stated in paragraph 28 of the complaint, but that no injury of which complainant can complain will result therefrom if defendant city has the rights claimed by it. . . . That the revenue for said purpose will be created and raised by borrowing money or raising funds within the limit of indebtedness, as heretofore or hereafter to be extended, in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution and provisions of the statutes of the state of Montana in that behalf, unless it shall be adjudged that it has no legal or equitable right to do so, on account of the facts and admission hereinbefore stated and made.'\n\n We agree with the circuit court of appeals that, by this stipulation, the controversy was narrowed to the question of the right of the city to erect and maintain an independent plant of its own, in view of the alleged contract rights of the complainant. For that purpose, if it has the right so to do, it is conceded 'it contemplates to raise funds and revenues therefor in the manner provided by law,' and will raise revenues within the limits of indebtedness authorized by the Constitution and laws of Montana. This concession renders it unnecessary to notice the allegations of the complaint as to the right to tax for the purpose of erecting such works, or the alleged invalidity of any method of acquiring waterworks for the city except by purchase from the complainant.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEWIT v. BERLIN MACH WORKS(1904)\nNo. 228\nArgued: April 18, 1904Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n Loren M. Hewit, as trustee in bankruptcy of Clara E. \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 297]\n\u00a0\n Kellogg, applied to the United States district court for the eastern district of New York for an order of sale of certain real estate, buildings, and machinery. Notice to creditors was given, and thereafter the Berlin Machine Works, a corporation, filed its petition, praying, on grounds set forth, to be declared the owner of certain machines included in the property, and be awarded possession thereof, and that they be exempted from sale, or that it be determined that the corporation is entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the machines, and to share in dividends on any unpaid balance. The matter was heard before the referee, who held that the corporation had lost the legal title to the machines, and must come in as an unsecured creditor. The corporation petitioned the district court for a review of the referee's decision, the referee made his certificate and return, and the matter was submitted to the court, which thereafter reversed the decision of the referee, and adjudged that the Berlin Machine Works had a good and valid title to the machines, and that the same be delivered to it, or, in the event that they had been disposed of, that the trustee pay over to the Berlin Machine Works the sum of $1,200, the value of the machines. 112 Fed. 52.\n The trustee then filed a petition in the district court, making application for revision and review in matter of law, and appealed to the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit from the judgment of the district court, and the district court ordered 'that a superintendency and revision and review in matter of law and an appeal be and the same hereby is allowed in the above-entitled proceedings to the circuit court of appeals, second circuit of the United States.' The circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court, 56 C. C. A. 383, 118 Fed. 1017, and thereupon an appeal was allowed to this court.\nMr. Frank H. Robinson for appellant. \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles M. Harrington and John L. Romer for appellee.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n If the trustee had carried the case to the circuit court of appeals on petition for supervision and revision under  \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n 24b of the bankruptcy law [30 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3432], the case would have fallen within Holden v. Stratton, \n191 U.S. 115\n, ante, p. 45, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45, and the appeal to this court would have failed. But he took it there by appeal, though accompanied by some apparent effort to avail himself also of the other method. And as the Berlin Machine Works asserted title to the property in the possession of the trustee by an intervention raising a distinct and separable issue, the controversy may be treated as one of those 'controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings' over which the circuit court of appeals could, under 24a, exercise appellate appeals could, under  24a, exercise appellate 25a relates to appeals from judgments in certain enumerated steps in bankruptcy proceedings, in respect of which special provision therefor was required. (Holden v. Stratton, \n191 U.S. 115\n, ante, p. 45, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45), while  24a relates to controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings in the exercise by the bankruptcy courts of the jurisdiction vested in them at law and in equity by  2, to settle the estates of bankrupts, and to determine controversies in relation thereto. Hutchinson v. Otis, \n190 U.S. 552\n, 47 L. ed. 1179, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778; Burleigh v. Foreman, 125 Fed. 217.\n The appeal to this court then followed, under  6 of the act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 549, 550].\n This brings us to the consideration of the case on the merits. The material facts are these: October 10, 1900, Clara E. Kellogg contracted with the Berlin Machine Works for the purchase of two wood-working machines at the price of $1,850, payment to be made within four months from date of shipment, and title to the property to remain in the machine company until fully paid for. The machines were shipped to Kellogg, October 29 and November 16, respectively, and were received by her, set up in her planing mill, and put in operation. October 29 and November 16 she signed and delivered to the machine company in payment for the machines two promissory notes for $925 each, payable in two and four months from their respective dates, to the order of the machine company, and each containing the following clause: \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n 'Title and right of possession of the property for which this note is given remains in the Berlin Machine Works until fully paid for.' Kellogg, on her voluntary petition, was adjudicated a bankrupt, March 1, 1901, and a trustee was selected March 22, and thereafter duly qualified. The notes have not been paid, and were mentioned in the schedules as secured claims, the security being the machines in question. It also appeared that January 21, 1901, Clara E. Kellogg, being insolvent, executed a conveyance of the planing mill to a corporation called the C. E. Kellogg Company, which being attacked as fraudulent, the property was voluntarily released to the trustee, all the capital stock of the company, the entire consideration of the alleged transfer, being surrendered to the company.\n This sale was a conditional sale, and the title did not pass to the vendee because the condition was not fulfilled (Ballard v. Burgett, 40 N. Y. 314; Cole v. Mann, 62 N. Y. 1) unless the statutes of New York otherwise provided. The applicable statute is  112 of chapter 418 of the Laws of 1897, which reads as follows:\n'Conditions and reservations in contracts for sale of goods and chattels.-Except as otherwise provided in this article, all conditions and reservations in a contract for the conditional sale of goods and chattels, accompanied by immediate delivery and continued possession of the thing contracted to be sold, to the effect that the ownership of such goods and chattels is to remain in the conditional vendor or in a person other than the conditional vendee, until they are paid for, or until the occurrence of a future event or contingency, shall be void as against subsequent purchasers, pledgees, or mortgagees in good faith, and as to them the sale shall be deemed absolute, unless such contract of sale, containing such conditions and reservations, or a true copy thereof, be filed as directed in this article.'\n\n It is admitted that the machine company did not comply with the statute until after the appointment and qualification \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n of the trustee; but if the trustee was not a subsequent purchaser, pledgee, or mortgagee in good faith, the omission to file the contract of sale was immaterial. Prentiss Tool & Supply Co. v. Schirmer, 136 N. Y. 305, 32 Am. St. Rep. 737, 32 N. E. 849.\n Did the trustee occupy the position of a subsequent purchaser, pledgee, or mortgagee in good faith? We dismiss the pretended conveyance by Kellogg to the Kellogg Company from discussion as the district court did, as it was attacked as fraudulent and without consideration, and was voluntarily released to the trustee, who derived no title thereby, and had none other than by operation of law.\n Section 70a of the bankruptcy law of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. at L. 565, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3451, provides:\n'The trustee of the estate of a bankrupt, upon his appointment and qualification, . . . shall . . . be vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt, as of the date he was adjudged a bankrupt, . . . to all . . . (5) property which, prior to the filing of the petition, he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him.'\n\n The district court, Hazel, J., held that the reasonable construction of this provision was that the trustee was vested with the title which the bankrupt had to property situated as described, and not otherwise, and quoted from the opinion of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in the case of Re New York Economical Printing Co. 49 C. C. A. 133, 110 Fed. 514, upholding that view, as follows: 'The bankrupt act does not vest the trustee with any better right or title to the bankrupt's property than belongs to the bankrupt or to his creditors at the time when the trustee's title accrues. The present act, like all preceding bankrupt acts, contemplates that a lien good at that time as against the debtor and as against all of his creditors shall remain undisturbed. If it is one which has been obtained in contravention of some provision of the act, which is fraudulent as to creditors, or invalid as to creditors for want of record, it is invalid as to the trustee.' And the circuit court of appeals, adhering to that decision \n\n[194 U.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n held in this case that, inasmuch as, by the New York statute, a conditional sale such as that in question was void only as against subsequent purchasers or pledgees or mortgagees in good faith, the district court was right, and affirmed the judgment. 56 C. C. A. 383, 118 Fed. 1017\n\n\n We concur in this view, which is sustained by decisions under previous bankruptcy laws (Winsor v. McLellan, 2 Story, 492, Fed. Cas. No. 17,887; Donaldson v. Farwell, \n93 U.S. 631\n, 23 L. ed. 993; Yeatman v. New Orleans Sav. Inst. \n95 U.S. 764\n, 24 L. ed. 589), and is not shaken by a different result in cases arising in states by whose laws conditional sales are void as against creditors.\n In our opinion, these machines were not, prior to the filing of the petition, property which, under the law of New York, might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against the bankrupt; nor could she have transferred it within the intent and meaning of  70a. See Low v. Welch, 139 Mass. 33, 29 N. E. 216. The company's title was good as against the trustee, who could not claim as a subsequent purchaser in good faith.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHILL v. MCCORD(1904)\nNo. 49\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a suit in equity commenced in the circuit court of Douglas county, Wisconsin, by Warren E. McCord, to obtain a decree adjudging the defendant, now plaintiff in error, John F. Hill, the holder of the legal title to the northwest quarter of section seventeen, in township forty- eight north, of range eight west, in Bayfield county, Wisconsin, in trust for the plaintiff. A demurrer to an amended complaint was sustained by the circuit court, but this ruling was reversed by the supreme court of the state. 111 Wis. 499, 84 N. W. 27, 85 N. W. 145, 87 N. W. 481. Thereafter an answer was filed, a hearing had, resulting in a decree for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the supreme court (117 Wis. 306, 94 N. W. 65), and thence the case was brought here on error.\n The following facts were found by the trial court, and the findings were sustained by the supreme court: One Philip W. Jacobus made an actual settlement on the land in controversy on January 28, 1891, and actually established his residence thereon February 4. The land was not opened for entry until February 23, 1891, and on that day Jacobus made application at the local land office to enter it as a homestead. On the same day Hill filed a soldier's declaratory statement for the same tract. A contest was had before the local land officers, resulting in a decision in favor of Jacobus. On ap- \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n peal to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, this decision was affirmed. Hill's declaratory statement was canceled, and the entry of Jacobus allowed on July 6, 1892. On September 20, 1892, Jacobus commuted his homestead entry, making and filing in good faith due, regular, and truthful proofs of settlement, occupation, and improvements, paying $400, and receiving a receiver's receipt and a certificate of entry certifying that he had purchased the land, and made full payment, and was entitled, on presentation of the certificate to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to receive a patent.\n On December 27, 1892, McCord and one Daniel McLeod purchased the land in good faith of Jacobus, paying him the sum of $4,250, and receiving a warranty deed. The negotiations between these grantees and Jacobus commenced on or about December 17, 1892, and prior to that time they had no interest in the land, and had no negotiations with him. While negotiating with Jacobus they asked Hill, at the time residing on a part of the tract, whether he had any claim upon the land, and whether Jacobus had good title thereto; and Hill then and there said to them that he had been fairly beaten in his contest with Jacobus, that he had no claim, and that if McCord and McLeod would buy the tract he would make no claim. At that time Hill knew that they were looking at the land with a view of purchasing it from Jacobus, and that the inquiry was made of him with reference to that purchase; and they did in fact rely upon Hill's statement, and purchased the land and paid for the same by reason thereof.\n A few days after the deed, and on January 4, 1893, for the purpose of putting the understanding between themselves and Hill in writing, the grantees had this instrument executed and acknowledged by Hill:\n For the purpose of making a settlement with John F. Hill, and his relinquishment on the N. W. 1\/4 of section 17, township 48, range 8 W., we hereby make him a present of a certain lot of logs, now skidded on said land, and give him permission till the 1st day of May, A. D. 1893, in which to enter on said \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n land to remove said logs, and to occupy the house on said land, and to remain on said land until that date, but not thereafter. Said logs amount to about 30,000 feet; and he agrees not to cut, nor allow any of his men to cut or destroy, any other timber. And in consideration of said logs, I, John F. Hill, being duly sworn, on oath, says that he is the man who made a soldier's application for said N. W. 1\/4 of 17-48-8 W.; and I make this affidavit for the purpose of relinquishing all my right, title, and interest in and to said claim, which I do unto the United States. Signed, sealed, and delivered and agreed upon this 4th day of January, A. D. 1893. Daniel McLeod. In presence of-- W. E. McCord. [Seal.]\n W. H. Packard. John F. Hill. [Seal.]\n Tracy Lyon.\n Prior to the commutation, and on March 3, 1891, Congress had passed an act amending  2301 of the Revised Statutes so as to read as follows:\n'Nothing in this chapter shall be so construed as to prevent any person who shall hereafter avail himself of the benefits of  2289 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1388), from paying the minimum price for the quantity of land so entered, at any time after the expiration of fourteen calendar months from the date of such entry, and obtaining a patent therefor, upon making proof of settlement and of residence and cultivation for such period of fourteen months.' 26 Stat. at L. 1098, chap. 561, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1406\n\n\n\n Neither Jacobus nor the land officers had any actual knowledge or information of this enactment at the time of the commutation. On May 15, 1893, the Assistant Commissioner of the General Land Office of the United States, having had his attention called to the act, notified Jacobus that he must furnish supplemental proofs showing residence and cultivation for a period of fourteen months subsequent to July 6, 1892, together with an affidavit that he had not alienated the land. Of course, compliance with this was impossible, for Jacobus had already made a conveyance. On September 1, \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n 1893, McCord and McLeod, with their wives, made to Jacobus a deed of conveyance of the land for an expressed consideration of $4,300, and Jacobus at the same time executed to them a mortgage upon the lands to secure the payment of the purchase money. On or about September 12, 1893, Jacobus caused to be made and filed in the local land office, in response to the order of supplemental proofs, certain affidavits and proofs, from which it appeared that the land was conveyed to McCord and McLeod and reconveyed, as hereinbefore stated; that Jacobus retained 2 acres of the land, and shortly after the sale of the said premises, and on or about February 20, 1893, he again went upon the land, and from that time up to the time of the filing of the affidavits continued to reside upon and improve the land. It did not appear that the purpose of the reconveyance and the return of Jacobus to the land was to obtain a title for the benefit of McCord and McLeod.\n On or about September 30, 1893, Hill filed in the local land office contest affidavits and objections to the receiving of said offered supplemental proofs. A hearing was had upon this contest and a large number of witnesses sworn. On August 9, 1894, the local land officers decided the contest in favor of Hill, and filed an opinion, in which they held that the residence of Jacobus up to the time of the sale and conveyance to McCord and McLeod in December, 1892, was fairly satisfactory, but that his residence after the sale and conveyance was for the sole purpose of enabling him to make proof to secure title for them, and that the land was reconveyed to him for that purpose alone. On appeal to the Commissioner of the General Land Office the findings of the local land officers were affirmed. On further appeal to the Secretary of the Interior the prior decisions were, on April 28, 1896, affirmed without any restatement of facts. On June 3, 1896, Congress passed an act containing the following provisions (29 Stat. at L. 197, chap. 312, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1409):\n'That whenever it shall appear to the Commissioner of the General Land Office that an error has heretofore been made by the officers of any local land office in receiving premature \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n commutation proofs under the homestead laws, and that there was no fraud practised by the entryman in making such proofs, and final payment has been made and a final certificate of entry has been issued to the entryman, and that there are no adverse claimants to the land described in the certificates of entry, whose rights originated prior to making such final proofs, and that no other reason why the title should not vest in the entryman exists except that the commutation was made less than fourteen months from the date of the homestead settlement, and that there was at least six months' actual residence in good faith by the homestead entryman on the land prior to such commutation, such certificates of entry shall be in all things confirmed to the entryman, his heirs and legal representatives, as of the date of such final certificate of entry, and a patent issue thereon; and the title so patented shall inure to the benefit of any grantee or transferee in good faith of such entryman subsequent to the date of such final certificate; Provided, That this act shall not apply to commutation and homestead entries on which final certificates have been issued, and which have heretofore been canceled, when the lands made vacant by such cancelation have been re-entered under the homestead act.\n\n'Sec. 2. That all commutations of homestead entries shall be allowed after the expiration of fourteen months from date of settlement.'\n\n Thereupon Jacobus made a motion before the Secretary of the Interior for a review of the decision of April 28, 1896, and also to confirm his entry under the authority of said act of June, 1896, which motions were denied. A patent was subsequently issued to Hill.\n Messrs. W. F. Bailey and W. H. Stafford for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Louis K. Luse, Lyman T. Powell, and A. L. Sanborn for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 400]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n There are two well-settled rules of decision, invoked respectively by the parties. One, that findings of fact made by the Land Department in the progress of a contest before it are conclusive upon the courts; the other, that questions of fact decided by a state court are not subject to review by this court in proceedings on error.\n Upon the record these questions of fact and law appear: First. Was the original entry allowed to Jacobus on July 6, 1892, rightful? In other words, was his evidence of settlement, occupation, and good faith true, and, if so, did it entitle him to priority over Hill, his contestant? Second. If that entry was valid, was the commutation entry made on September 20, 1892, illegal? Third. If so, was the defect which invalidated it subject to removal under the act of June 3, 1896? Fourth. If removable, was there anything in the conduct of Jacobus or his grantees after the original entry to prevent the removal?\n With reference to the first question, it appears that the original entry to Jacobus followed a contest between himself and Hill. In that contest testimony was taken before the local land officers upon the question whether Jacobus had performed the acts required of a settler upon public lands, and, upon a review, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on April 29, 1892, found in favor of his settlement, residence, and improvements and allowed the entry. No appeal was taken from this decision, and if nothing else appeared the findings would obviously be conclusive in the courts as between Jacobus and Hill. It is undoubtedly true that, until the legal title has passed from the government, proceedings in the land office are in fieri, and a question, whether of fact or law, may be reopened for consideration. Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 U.S. 589\n-592, 42 L. ed. 591, 592, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208, and cases cited. It is insisted that the validity of the original entry was relitigated \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 401]\n\u00a0\n IN THE LAND OFFICE IN PURSUANCE OF THE COntest made by hill in october, 1893, and a different conclusion reached. While the power of reexamination is not to be doubted, yet a decision upon a question of fact, once made in a special proceeding finally terminated, should not be regarded as overthrown by findings in a subsequent proceeding in the Department unless it appears that those findings directly overrule, or are necessarily inconsistent with, the prior decision. The application of Hill, in 1893, to contest the entry of Jacobus, charged as a basis of contest that Jacobus never settled on the land in good faith, but for the purpose of speculation; that he did not reside on the land during the next six months preceding the making of his final proof, and that he had sold the land to one W. E. McCord. A hearing was had upon this contest before the local land officers, and quite a volume of testimony taken. Their decision was adverse to Jacobus. It was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and reaffirmed by the Secretary of the Interior. In their decision the local land officers stated the questions to be considered in these words:\n'Letter 'H' of November 18, 1893, directed this office to order a hearing on the charges.\n\n'The two questions to be passed upon are: (1) Did Jacobus abandon the land? (2) Was the sale of the land to McCord and McLeod a bar to the offering of supplemental proof?'\n\n And upon the first question they found as follows:\n'Upon the first point the testimony of the witness is extremely conflicting. It is admitted by Jacobus that he worked at his trade in Superior and Iron River most of the time during his occupancy of the land, but it seems also fairly well established by the testimony or Mrs. Jacobus and numerous other witnesses that her residence was upon the land, barring certain absences on account of sickness and visits. Their cabin and its housekeeping equipment were superior to those of most homesteaders, and the clearing, in extent and \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 402]\n\u00a0\n cultivation, compared favorably with that of others in the same neighborhood.\n\n'After learning that supplemental proof would probably be required, Mrs. Jocobus returned to the land in February, 1893, where she remained about a week, when she returned to Iron River and remained for some weeks while being treated for rheumatism. She made a brief visit to the claim in March, went there again in the latter part of May, remaining two weeks, and returned for the same time in July. This was apparently her last stay upon the land until after supplemental proof was offered, September 20. A small crop of vegetables and hay was raised that season, as in the two years before.\n\n'Upon the whole, the residence of Jacobus upon the land was fairly satisfactory until after the offering of his first proof; but it is clear that his subsequent residence was for the sole purpose of enabling him to make proof in order to secure title for his transferees.'\n\n After this they considered the effect of the sale of the land to McCord and McLeod, and in so doing commented upon the character of the occupation by Jacobus and his wife during the spring and summer of 1893, closing with a decision in these words: 'We are of the opinion therefore, that Jacobus' supplemental proof cannot be sustained, and that the entry should be canceled and a preference right of entry awarded the contestant, Hill.'\n Apparently the character of the occupation and improvements by Jacobus prior to the original entry of July 6, 1892, was not a matter considered by the local land officers, although it is true that there was some testimony respecting it. They did not pretend to disturb the approval of the sufficiency of Jacobus' occupation and improvements made in allowing that entry after the conclusion of the original contest between Hill and Jacobus. They assumed that that matter was already settled. This is evident from the two questions which they say were presented, and if they considered it at all, they doubt- \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 403]\n\u00a0\n less thought the testimony was not such as to justify any change in the previous conclusion. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. In his opinion, after reciting the contest, the decision, and the grounds of appeal, the fact of the commutation of the homestead entry, the direction to Jacobus to furnish supplemental proof, as the commutation was premature, he says:\n'It is shown by the evidence that defendant had a small log house on the land; that it was well finished and well furnished; that he had about 2 acres cleared; that the improvements were worth about $200. He did not have any stock of any description, no chickens or other poultry; that on December 27, 1892, defendant sold said land to Divid McLeod and W. E. McCord for $4,250 cash.\n\n'On the question of residence the testimony is very conflicting.\n\n'Defendant's wife stayed on the land a part of the time and defendant worked in his barber shop in the town of Iron River, and stayed there nearly all the time, working at his trade; he made occasional visits to the land on the Sabbath day.\n\n'It also appears that the defendant rented three rooms in Iron River after he had sold the land, and he, with his wife, moved into them; that after defendant learned that he was required to furnish supplemental proof, because his commutation was premature, his wife moved back to the land, but defendant still remained in Iron River, making occasional visits to the land on the Sabbath and returning the same day.'\n\n Obviously the time of occupation referred to was after the commutation. This is made clear by a comparison of this opinion with that of the local land officers. If other grounds were relied on than those stated in the opinion of the local land officers, they would have been distinctly stated, and the fact that the decision was based upon the character of the occupation and improvements prior to the original entry would \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 404]\n\u00a0\n have been made clear. This conclusion is strengthened by the final declaration of the Commissioner:\n'The sale and conveyance of the land is clearly proven, and it is also as clearly shown that the land was reconveyed to defendant so that he could submit his final supplemental proof for the benefit of McLeod and McCord; hence your opinion is affirmed.'\n\n This decision of the Commissioner of the General Land Office was sustained by the Secretary of the Interior in an opinion which contains no recital of facts, but simply says:\n'Said decision fairly sets forth all the facts in this case, and the conclusion therein reached is sustained by the testimony, and is in conformity with law and the decisions of the Department, and is hereby affirmed.'\n\n In the final opinion of the supreme court of the state is this statement:\n'We still think it plain, therefore, that no questions involving Jacobus' proceedings up to and including the final proof of September, 1892, were passed upon in the consideration of the contest had in 1894. Indeed, this seems to be the view of appellant's counsel as well, for he declares in his brief that 'no question of mala fides was found in the making of proofs [of September, 1892], nor was the subject considered. Simply from the evidence, which was the same as the affidavits, they determined the second question which they stated at the outset, that the sale of the land to McCord and McLeod was a bar to the offering of supplemental proof.\" [117 Wis. 313, 94 N. W. 67.]\n\n While no such admission is found in the brief filed in this court, possibly the omission may have been induced by the stress of the case.\n We agree, therefore, with that court, that there is noting in the record to justify a conclusion that the Land Department ever changed its finding, made in allowng the original entry, of the sufficiency of Jacobus' occupation and improvements up to that time.\n It is also worthy of notice in passing that the supreme \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 405]\n\u00a0\n court, in its opinion, held that the representations and instrument made and executed by Hill estopped him from questioning the validity of the original entry, so far, at least, as against the plaintiff, although they would not bar the United States from reclaiming the land.\n We proceed, therefore, to a consideration of the other questions. At the time the commutation was allowed neither Jacobus nor the land officers had actual knowledge of the act of March 3, 1891. Such is the finding of the state court, and, being a question of fact, this finding is conclusive. Prior thereto a commutation made as this was would have been valid, and there is neither finding nor testimony that Jacobus or the land officers acted in bad faith in the matter. There was simply a proceeding, theretofore legal and proper, taken in actual ignorance of a restraining statute. The act of 1896 was obviously passed to reach such a case as this, in which a commutation was allowed within less than fourteen months from the date of the homestead entry, and to do away with the objection on account of the matter of time. Certain provisions were incorporated in order to prevent injustice to other parties. But, as between the government and the entryman, its purpose was to give validity to the commutation if it would have been valid had not the act of 1891 been passed.\n Upon what ground did the Land Department set aside the commutation entry, and afterwards refuse to reinstate it? The original entry was July 6; the commutation September 20,-not three months thereafter. The act of 1891 allowed commutation only fourteen months or over after the entry. The commutation, therefore, was illegal. Within less than six months after the original entry, and four months after the commutation, Jacobus sold and conveyed the land, and his grantees became thereafter the parties solely interested. Pre-emption and homestead entries by statute must be made for the exclusive use and benefit of the parties making the entries (Rev. Stat .  2262, 2290), and in each case an affidavit to that effect is required. Whatever Jacobus did after his con- \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 406]\n\u00a0\n veyance in December, 1892, was not for his exclusive use and benefit. He attempted to get around the limitations and requirement of the statute by taking a reconveyance from his grantees, giving to them, at the same time, a mortgage to secure the consideration stated in the deed, and by an affidavit stating that, at the time of his conveyance, in December, he reserved about 2 acres of land where his house and other improvements were located, and that when he heard of the act requiring fourteen months' residence before commutation he again took possession of the tract, and continued in occupation and cultivation. This was held insufficient to avoid the restraint of the statute, and upon this ground the commutation entry was set aside. The local land officers, in their opinion, say:\n'The bare statement of facts points to the conclusion that the sale of the land in December, 1892, was absolute, and that the subsequent reisdence of Jacobus upon the land was as the agent of the transferees, and for the purpose of acquiring title for them. This conclusion is strongly supported by the admission of Jacobus upon cross-examination.\n\n'Jacobus, by the deed executed in December, 1892, devested himself of all right and title to the land. Granting, therefore, that the reconveyance of September 1st, 1893, was made in good faith by all parties, the slender residence of the wife, during the spring and summer of 1893, was not upon the homestead of Jacobus, but upon land in which he had no claim or interest, and the residence, such as it was, could not avail him in making supplemental proof. But we think all the circumstances-the time at which the conveyance from McCord and McLeod to Jacobus was made, the execution of the mortgage, and the evidence of Jacobus himself-show that the land was not reconveyed to Jacobus in good faith, but for the sole purpose of enabling him to make supplemontal proof for the benefit of his grantees. We are of the opinion, therefore, that Jacobus' supplemental proof cannot be sustained, and that the entry should be canceled, and a preference right \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 407]\n\u00a0\n of entry awarded to the contestant, Hill.'\n\n While the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in his opinion, concludes:\n'The sale and conveyance of the land is clearly proven, and it is also clearly shown that the land was reconveyed to defendant, so that he could submit his final supplemental proof for the benefit of McLeod and McCord; hence, your opinion is affirmed, and defendant's homestead and his cash entry for the land involved is held for cancelation.'\n\n While these opinions may have correctly declared the law as it stood when they were delivered, we may remark, in passing, that Jacobus seems to have acted in an honest effort to protect his grantees from the consequences of a mistake made by himself and the local land officers at the time of the commutation.\n When the act of 1896 was passed the matter was still pending in the Department, and no entry had been made by Hill. The motions by Jacobus for a review and to confirm his entry were denied by the Secretary of the Interior, the ground of the decision being, as stated in a communication to the Commissioner of the General Land Office:\n'The evidence in the cases at bar clearly shows that the entry was not made in good faith, and the proof submitted by the entryman was fraudulent, as fully set out in your office decision of January 23, 1895.\n\n'It is likewise impossible to confirm the entry under the provisions of the act of June 3, 1896, for the same reason; namely, the practice of fraud in making proofs.'\n\n The reference in this to the decision of the Commissioner makes it clear that the fraud and the want of good faith mentioned were in the commutation entry and the supplemental proofs. Evidently the Secretary ruled that the act of 1896 did not confirm a previous premature commutation entry if the entryman was guilty of any fraud or wrong subsequent thereto in attempting to make good the title acquired thereby. We do not so understand the law. If, at the time of the com- \n\n[195 U.S. 395, 408]\n\u00a0\n mutation entry, there had been no fraud or lack of good faith, and the only defect was in the matter of time, we do not think the confirmation authorized by the act of 1896 is destroyed by anything like that shown to have been done by Jacobus in his effort to protect the title he had conveyed to McCord and McLeod. In other words, if the commutation entry was rightful save for the fact that it was premature, the act of 1896 does away with that objection and confirms the entry; and the right to that confirmation is not destroyed by that which the entryman may have done in a subsequent effort to protect his title.\n We see no error in the proceedings, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHODGES v. COLCORD(1904)\nNo. 155\nArgued: Decided: March 7, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. J. S. Jenkins for appellants.\n Messrs. John W. Shartel, James R. Keaton, and Frank Wells for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n On June 1, 1901, James L. Hodges filed his petition in the district court of Oklahoma county, Oklahoma territory, praying that the defendants, the heirs of William R. Colcord, deceased, the holders of the legal title by patent from the United States to a tract of land in the county, be decreed to hold that title in trust for him. In it he alleged that on July 22, 1889, he was legally qualified to make a homestead entry of the land; that on that day he settled upon it with intent to acquire title under the homestead laws of the United States, and immediately made permanent and lasting improvements, as required by law. He further alleged 'that at the time he entered upon said land, and made settlement thereon, one John Gayman had entered upon and occupied said land; that on the 25th day of April, 1889, the said John Gayman obtained a pretended \n\n[193 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n homestead entry on said land; that said Gayman was disqualified from ever entering or obtaining any right or title to said land, by reason of his entering upon and occupying a portion of the Oklahoma country declared open to settlement by the President's proclamation of March 23, 1889 [26 Stat. at L. 1544], prior to 12 o'clock noon, April 22, 1889, as shown by a copy of the decision of the Land Department, recorded in vol. 24, page 221 of the United States Land Decisions, hereto attached, marked 'Exhibit A,' and made a part of this petition.\n'In the decision above referred to the honorable Secretary of the Interior finds as facts that James L. Hodges has resided on said land since July 22, 1889; that Runyan has resided on said land since May 13, 1890, and William R. Colcord since 1893\n\n\n\n'Said William R. Colcord filed his contest against the said John Gayman on the 23d day of July, 1889, on the ground of disqualification, and the plaintiff James L. Hodges filed his contest against said John Gayman August 23, 1889, on the ground of prior settlement, as shown by the decision of the Hon. Secretary of the Interior, dated December 1, 1894, hereto attached, marked 'Exhibit B,' and made a part hereof.'\n\n A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the district court, and the suit dismissed. The decision was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory (70 Pac. 383), whereupon an appeal was taken to this court. Pending the proceedings in the territorial courts Hodges died, and the suit was revived in the names of his heirs.\n The appellants' contention is that Gayman was legally disqualified to make a homestead entry of the land; that his entry was absolutely void; that Hodges was the first person legally qualified to make an entry who actually settled upon the land, and that therefore, upon Gayman's relinquishment, he became entitled to entry and patent. On the other hand, the defendants contention rests on  2. chap. 89 (21 Stat. at L. 141, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1392), which provides:\n'Sec. 2. In all cases where any person has contested, paid \n\n[193 U.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n the land office fees, and procured the cancelation of any pre-emption, homestead, or timber culture entry, he shall be notified by the register of the land office of the district in which such land is situated of such cancelation, and shall be allowed thirty days from date of such notice to enter said lands.'\n\n The exhibits attached to the petition show that the Land Department found that Gayman was within the territory at the time of the opening of the lands for settlement; that after the decision in Smith v. Townsend, \n148 U.S. 490\n, 37 L. ed. 533, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 634, he filed a relinquishment in the local land office, and that such relinquishment was induced by the contest of Colcord. This finding, being one of fact, is conclusive upon the courts. Colcord was the contestant who procured the cancelation of Gayman's homestead entry. He comes within the terms of the statute. Was this statutory right of entry destroyed by Hodges' settlement, a settlement made intermediate Gayman's homestead entry and the initiation of this contest? We are of the opinion that it was not. Gayman's homestead entry was prima facie valid. There was nothing on the face of the record to show that he had entered the territory prior to the time fixed for the opening thereof for settlement, or that he had in any manner violated the statute or the proclamation of the President. This prima facie valid entry removed the land, temporarily, at least, out of the public domain, and beyond the reach of other homestead entries. The first to contest was Colcord, and as a result of that contest Gayman relinquished his entry. To take from Colcord the benefit of the relinquishment which his contest had secured would be an injustice to him as well as a disregard of the act of 1880.\n Some reliance is placed by the appellants on the language of this court in Calhoun v. Violet, \n173 \nU.S. 60, 64\n, 43 S. L. ed. 614, 615, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324, 325, in which we said in respect to an entry similar to Gayman's 'that an entry of land made under such circumstances was void, and that the ruling by the Land Department so holding was correct;' but that language was used with reference to the claim of the entryman, and what was meant was that such entry \n\n[193 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n was void as to him,-that is, gave him no rights. So here the entry by Gayman was, as to him, void,-gave him no rights. But that decision did not determine what effect an entry prima facie valid, yet made by one in fact disqualified to make the entry, had upon the status of the land or the rights of other parties. Generally, a homestead entry while it remains uncanceled withdraws the land from subsequent entry. Such has been the ruling of the Land Department. In Re Cliff, 3 Land Dec. 216, 218, it was said by Secretary Teller:\n'Under the present ruling of this department, entries of record prima facie valid appropriate the lands covered thereby, and, while they remain uncanceled, the land is not subject to further entry. Graham v. Hastings & D. R. Co. 1 Land Dec. 362; Whitney v. Maxwell, 2 Land Dec. 98; McAvinney v. McNamara, 10 C. L. O. 274; Davis v. Crans, 11 C. L. O. 20.'\n\n The same proposition was affirmed in Re Laird, 13 Land Dec. 502, 503. In McMichael v. Murphy, 20 Land Dec. 147, 150, the question arose as to an entry in Oklahoma, and Secretary Smith discussed it in these words:\n'Although White had entered the Oklahoma country during the prohibitory period, yet his homestead entry was prima facie valid. Its invalidity had to be established by extraneous evidence, and a judgment as to its illegality pronounced by a competent tribunal. Had that never been done, the tract covered by said entry would have remained forever segregated from the public domain; so far, at least, as the unquestioned legality of the entry itself could accomplish that fact. Hence it cannot be regarded as void, but voidable only. True, White lacked one of the essential qualifications of an entryman for Oklahoma lands. But it has been held that the entry of an alien (who also lacks the very essential qualifications of citizenship) is not void, but voidable. Leary v. Manuel, 12 Land Dec. 345; Hollants v. Sullivan, 5 Land Dec. 115; Pfaff v. Williams, 4 Land Dec. 455; St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. v. Forseth, 3 Land Dec. 446. Being voidable only, White's entry segregated the land so long as it remained of record.' \n\n[193 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n In Jones v. Arthur, 28 Land Dec. 235, it was decided that 'land in the actual possession and occupancy of one holding the same under claim and color of title is not subject to homestead entry.' See also Butler v. California, 29 Land Dec. 610. In Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 18 L. ed. 339, it was held that 'lands originally public cease to be public after they have been entered at the land office, and a certificate of entry has been obtained;' and in Hastings & D. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 U.S. 357\n, 33 L. ed. 363, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112, it was said by Mr. Justice Lamar ( p. 361, L. ed. p. 365, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 114):\n\n'In the light of these decisions the almost uniform practice of the Department has been to regard land upon which an entry of record valid upon its face has been made, as appropriated and withdrawn from subsequent homestead entry, pre-emption settlement, sale, or grant until the original entry be canceled or declared forfeited; in which case the land reverts to the government as part of the public domain, and becomes again subject to entry under the land laws.'\n\n And again, on page 364, L. ed. p. 366, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 115, after noticing some defects in the form of the entry:\n'But these defects, whether they be of form or substance, by no means render the entry absolutely a nullity. So long as it remains a subsisting entry of record, whose legality has been passed upon by the land authorities, and their action remains unreversed, it is such an appropriation of the tract as segregates it from the public domain, and therefore precludes it from subsequent grants.'\n\n But it is unnecessary to multiply quotations. The entry of Gayman, though ineffectual to vest any rights in him, and therefore void as to him, was such an entry as prevented the acquisition of homestead rights by another until it had been set aside. It was relinquished and removed from the records of the land office as the result of a contest by Colcord. He was entitled under the statute to the benefit of that contest, and was rightfully given an entry of, and patent to, the land.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOOKER v. BURR(1904)\nNo. 263\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The plaintiff in error commenced this action in the proper state court to procure a decree canceling a deed of the premises mentioned in the complaint, executed by the defendant Hammel to the defendant Rhodes, and also directing that a deed should be executed to the plaintiff by defendant Hammel \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n or Burr, or both, conveying the same property to the plaintiff, which had been purchased by him under the sale in foreclosure hereinafter mentioned. Defendant Burr was sheriff at the time of that sale, and conducted the same, and executed the certificate of sale June 13, 1898. His term of office expired in January, 1899, and defendant Hammel became his successor, and, as such, executed the deed to defendant Rhodes, which plaintiff in error asks to have set aside. The two defendants, Burr and Hammel, were made parties herein because it was not certain which one of them should be decreed to execute the deed to plaintiff which he asks for in this suit.\n The defendants, by their answer, denied many of the material allegations of the complaint, and the case went to trial before the court, and, a judgment having been entered dismissing the complaint on the merits, an appeal was taken to the supreme court of California, which affirmed the judgment (137 Cal. 663, 70 Pac. 778), and the plaintiff has brought the case here. The material facts are as follows:\n On October 16, 1893, Anna P. and Ambrose H. Spencer, then being the owners of the property, mortgaged the same to one Jacob Swiggart, to secure the payment of a promissory note of the same date for $5,000. This note and mortgage were subsequently assigned by Swiggart to Charles H. Bishop, who afterwards commenced a suit upon the note and mortgage to recover the amount due on the former, and to foreclose the mortgage. On May 14, 1898, a judgment was entered in the case, whereby it was adjudged that there was due to the plaintiff upon the note the sum of $6,782.49, and that the same was a lien upon the mortgaged premises, and there was also a judgment for the sale of the premises to obtain payment of the sum found due on the note. On May 16, 1898, an execution upon the judgment was issued to the sheriff (Burr) and on June 13, 1898, he sold to the plaintiff in error, Hooker, the mortgaged premises for the sum of $9,500, who thereupon paid the amount of his bid to Burr, and Burr then gave a certificate of sale to the plaintiff as the purchaser. Plaintiff alleges that he was \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n entitled to a deed from the sheriff of date December 13, 1898, that being six months after his purchase at the foreclosure sale. On December 12, 1898, Rhodes, one of the defendants (who was a judgment creditor of Spencer, the mortgagor), issued an execution on his judgment, and assumed to redeem the land from the foreclosure sale by the payment of $10,070 to the sheriff, to be paid to the purchaser, the plaintiff in error, being the amount of the purchase price paid by the latter at the foreclosure sale, together with interest thereon at the rate of 1 per cent per month. The sum was received by the sheriff as the full amount due to the plaintiff in error on his bid, with interest. The plaintiff in error declined to accept the money, and now contends that the amount delivered to the sheriff for the redemption was not enough; and he also makes the claim that there was never any legal payment to the sheriff, even of the sum mentioned. The sheriff, after receiving the redemption money, executed a deed to the judgment creditor, Rhodes, and it is this deed which plaintiff seeks to have set aside.\n At the time when the above-mentioned mortgage was executed, on October 16, 1893, the law in California provided that a judgment debtor or redemptioner might redeem the property from the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, at any time, within six months after the sale, on paying the purchaser the amount of his purchase money, with interest at 2 per cent a month thereon in addition, up to the time of redemption. On March 27, 1895, the legislature altered this statute, which was  702 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by providing that redemption might be made upon the payment of the amount of the purchase money with one per cent a month as interest thereon, and on February 26, 1897, the same section was again amended by the legislature by extending the time for redemption to twelve instead of six months, while keeping the rate of interest at 1 per cent per month on the amount of the purchase price paid at the sale.\n It will be noticed that both these amendments had been \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n enacted, and existed as the law in regard to redemptions, at the time when the sale was made on June 13, 1898, upon the foreclosure of the mortgage.\nMr. J. S. Chapman for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. H. Anderson, E. C. Bower, and Anderson & Anderson for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the above statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error contends that the several alterations of the law as it existed at the time when this mortgage was executed, regarding the time of redemption and the amount of interest payable to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale in order to redeem the land sold, impair the obligation of a contract as to all mortgages in existence before the alterations were made.\n The first inquiry is, Whose contract was impaired by the alteration of the law? It is seen that the amount due on the mortgage in question at the time of the sale upon foreclosure was $6,782.49, and that the property sold for $9,500. That amount was paid by the purchaser to the sheriff, and it resulted in the payment of the mortgage debt, principal and interest, and the release of the land from the lien of the mortgage. Subsequently to that payment the mortgagee had no interest in further proceedings. Neither the mortgagee nor his assignee was the purchaser at the sale, and neither was in any manner injured by the alterations of the law in the respects mentioned. If, therefore, there was by this legislation an impairment of the obligation of a contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, which the latter could have taken advantage of if injured thereby, it is perfectly clear that he is not in the least injured when, by the sale under his mortgage, he realizes the full amount of his debt, principal, interest, and costs. What \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n can he complain of under such circumstances, even conceding an abstract impairment of the obligation of his contract? Having realized and been paid in full the entire amount of money called for by his mortgage, he surely cannot be heard to complain that, nevertheless, the obligation of his contract was impaired. If not injured to the extent of a penny thereby, his abstract rights are unimportant.\n We have lately held (therein following a long line of authorities) that a party insisting upon the invalidity of a statute, as violating any constitutional provision, must show that he may be injured by the unconstitutional law, before the courts will listen to his complaint. Tyler v. Registration Judges, \n179 U.S. 405\n, 45 L. ed. 252, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206; Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 \nU.S. 51, 60\n, 47 S. L. ed. 70, 74, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20. If, instead of showing any injury, the plaintiff shows that he cannot possibly be injured, he cannot, of course, ask the interference of the court. Therefore, if the mortgagee, or his assignee, were himself the plaintiff, and complaining that the obligation of his contract had been impaired by subsequent legislation, it is plain his complaint would be dismissed when it appeared that, notwithstanding the alleged subsequent illegal legislation, he suffered no injury, because he had proceeded with the foreclosure of his mortgage, and had been paid the full amount of his contract debt, interest, and costs. Under such circumstances the question becomes a moot one, and courts do not sit to decide that charater of question. American Book Co. v. Kansas, \n193 U.S. 49\n, ante, p. 394, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 394; Jones v. Montague, decided April 25, 1904, \n194 U.S. 147\n, ante, 611, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n The question of the impairment of the mortgage contract, therefore, is not before us as between mortgagor and mortgagee.\n We are of opinion that, as to the plaintiff in error, an independent purchaser at the foreclosure sale, having no connection whatever with the original contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee, his rights are to be determined by the law as it existed at the time he became a purchaser, unless, upon action taken by the mortgagee, the property had been sold \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n under a decree providing that it should be sold without regard to the subsequent legislation which impaired his contract. The purchaser bought at the time when the law, as altered, was in operation, and, so far as he was concerned, it was a valid law; his contract was made under that law, and it is no business of his whether the original contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee was impaired or not by the subsequent legislation. He cannot be heard to contend that the original law applies to him, because a subsequent statute might be void as to some one else. The some one else might waive its illegality, or consent to its enforcement, or the question might have no importance because the property sold for enough to pay the debt, even though there was an abstract impairment of the obligation of his contract.\n The purchaser must found his rights upon the law as it existed when he purchased. An alteration after he had purchased, to his prejudice, would be a different thing. Cooley, Const. Lim. 4th ed. 356. We agree that the law existing when a mortgage is made enters into, and becomes a part of, the contract; but that contract has nothing to do, so far as this question is concerned, with the contract of a purchaser at a foreclosure sale, having no other connection with the mortgage then that of a purchaser at such sale. His rights regarding matters of redemption are to be determined as we have stated.\n It has been so decided in the case of Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Cushman, \n108 U.S. 51\n, 27 L. ed. 648, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236. There the property was sold at foreclosure sale for enough to pay the mortgage debt ( page 56, L. ed. p. 652, Sup. Ct. Rep. 241), and the reduction of the rate of interest which was payable to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, upon a redemption (which reduction was made by the legislature prior to the sale, although subsequently to the mortgage), was held valid. The company, as purchaser at the foreclosure sale, bid enough to pay the principal and interest of its debt, and after the purchase it contended that the attempted redemption was insufficient because the interest upon the amount it \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n had bid upon the sale had been computed at 8 per cent, the rate of interest allowed by law at the time of the sale, instead of 10 per cent, the rate existing at the time of the execution of the mortgage. It was held that, as to the purchaser, the rate existing at the time of the sale was the legal rate, and the redemption at that rate was valid. The principle of that case decides the one at bar.\n It is asserted, however, on the part of the plaintiff in error, that Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 U.S. 118\n, 41 L. ed. 93, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1042, has in effect overruled the former case, and that upon the principle decided in the Barnitz Case the plaintiff in error herein is entitled to a reversal of the judgment. We are not of that opinion.\n In the first place, it was distinctly stated in Barnitz v. Beverly that it was not inconsistent with, and did not overrule, the former case, and its facts show a clear distinction between the two cases. The sum bid at the foreclosure sale did not pay the amount due on the mortgage, and the whole case shows that, although the mortgagee became purchaser, the debt of the mortgagor was not thereby paid, and it was the mortgagee's rights under her contract, as contained in the mortgage, and not her rights as a purchaser at the foreclosure sale, that were in controversy.\n In the Cushman Case, on the contrary, the amount bid at the foreclosure sale paid the mortgage debt, and the subsequent position of the mortgagee was as a purchaser only. The Barnitz Case was decided distinctly upon the ground that, by the subsequent legislation, there was an impairment of the obligation of the contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and it was her rights as mortgagee that were passed upon and recognized by the court. This is plain from a perusal of the opinion, especially at pages 130 and 131, L. ed. p. 101, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 1046, 1047\n\n\n Attention is also called by plaintiff in error to a portion of the opinion in which it is stated that, 'Without pursuing the subject further, we hold that a statute which authorizes the redemption of property sold upon foreclosure of a mortgage, where no right of redemption previously existed, or which \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n extends the period of redemption beyond the time formerly allowed, cannot constitutionally apply to a sale under a mortgage executed before its passage.' And it is asserted that such a case is now before the court.\n These remarks must be interpreted in the light of the facts of that case, and must be limited in their application to the parties to the mortgage contract whose rights are impaired by subsequent legislation. If the mortgage had been foreclosed, and the mortgagee had thereby realized his debt, principal and interest, in full, upon the sale, there can be no doubt that he would not have been heard to assert the invalidity of the subsequent legislation, nor would an independent pruchaser at the sale have been heard to make the same complaint. Of course, this does not include the case of a mortgagee who purchases at the foreclosure sale, and bids a price sufficient to pay his mortgage debt in full with interest, and an action thereafter commenced against him to set aside the sale because it was made in violation of legislation subsequent to the mortgage. In such case we suppose there can be no doubt of the right of the mortgagee to assert, as a defense to the action, the unconstitutionality of the subsequent legislation as an impairment of his contract contained in the mortgage. But it may be said that where the legal or equitable rights of a party are not in any way touched, and he is in no way injured, he cannot be heard to complain of the impairment of the obligation of his contract, as a mere abstract proposition.\n Many of the earlier cases declare the invalidity of subsequent laws in regard to redemption of land sold under execution, which altered the law existing when a mortgage was made, and some of them, it would seem, have declared the laws unconstitutional, even at the suit of a purchaser at the sale. The leading ease on the subject of redemption decides nothing as to the rights of a purchaser. It is that of Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143. In that case the subsequent legislation which was held to be invalid gave twelve months after sale in which to redeem, and provided that the property should not be sold \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n under the foreclosure decree unless two thirds of the amount which had previously been established by appraisers as the value of the property should be bid at the sale. The case came before the court upon a division of opinion. Bronson, the mortgagee, filed his bill to foreclose the mortgage, and asked for a decree that the mortgaged premises should be sold to the highest bidder without being subject to the rule established by the subsequent legislation. The motion was resisted on the part of defendants, who moved that the decree should direct the sale according to the subsequent legislation, and the judges were opposed in opinion as to the sale of the premises without regard to the subsequent law. This court held that the subsequent law was plainly one which impaired the obligation of the contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and, at the request of the mortgagee, and to prevent the impairment of the obligation of his contract, the court decreed that the sale should be made without reference to the law passed subsequently to the time of the execution of the mortgage contract.\n McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608, 11 L. ed. 397, arose in the same way and was decided substantially upon the authority of the last case. The mortgagee made the same request, that the marshal should sell the property without regard to the statute of Illinois passed subsequently to the execution of the mortgage, and it was held that his motion should be granted, because the subsequent legislation impaired his contract as mortgagee with the mortgagor.\n In Gantly v. Ewing, 3 How. 707, 11 L. ed. 794, after the mortgage had been executed, the legislature passed an act which required, on sales upon execution issued upon a judgment, that the property should first be appraised, and should not thereafter be sold on execution for a sum less than one half the appraised value. The mortgagee foreclosed the mortgage, and upon the sale the premises were sold to the defendants for $76,-not a tenth part of the mortgage debt. The property had not been valued prior to the sale, as required by the statute. An act \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n had, however, been passed prior to the execution of the mortgage, requiring the sheriff on such sales to first offer the rents and profits of the real estate for a term of seven years, and if the same did not bring enough to satisfy the execution, then the fee simple was to be offered for sale, and sold. This offer to sell the rents and profits was not in fact made. There were two questions upon which the judges were opposed: the one as to the effect of the failure to make the offer to sell the rents and profits, and the other regarding the effect of the failure to make the appraisal. A certificate of division of opinion was sent to this court. The action was, as stated in the opinion, one of ejectment; the defendants setting up and claiming under the sheriff's deed, and the plaintiff, the mortgagee, asking the court to instruct the jury that the deed was void because the rents and profits had not been offered for sale before the fee simple was sold, and also because the land had not been valued, as required by the statute, before the sale was made. The mortgagee was thus the party claiming that the sale under his own foreclosure was void because of the failure to comply with the subsequent legislation of Indiana, while the defendants who bid at the sale and became the purchasers of the land insisted that the act (existing when they purchased) was unconstitutional, because it altered the law as it existed when the mortgage was made, and required that the land should not be sold until it had been appraised, and then only after at least one half of the value so appraised had been bid. This court held that the offer to sell the rents and profits for seven years, as provided for by the statute existing prior to the execution of the mortgage, should have been made, and that the sale, such offer not having been made, was void; but it held that the condition provided for in the later statute, of not selling unless the appraisal had taken place and more than one half such appraised value had thereafter been bid, was void as an impairment of the obligation of the contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and the deed of the sheriff could not, so far as that ground was concerned, be avoided, \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n although no valuation of the property was made before the sale. The case was decided, as the opinion shows, entirely upon the authority of Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143, which, as we have seen, was not a case of a purchaser, and was decided upon the prayer of the mortgagee, who contended that his contract contained in his mortgage would be impaired by the subsequent law if the court should permit it to be enforced.\n The question again arose in Howard v. Bugbee, 24 How. 461, 16 L. ed. 753, and that case was also decided upon the authority of Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 D. ed. 143. In the statement of fact by Mr. Justice Nelson, it appears that the mortgage by Parsons to Tait was executed in 1836, and in a subsequent year (1842) the law regarding redemption was altered, and a right was given to a judgment creditor to redeem for two years after a sale under a mortgage. The mortgage was foreclosed in 1848, and Howard, the appellant, became the purchaser of the premises at the sale under the decree of foreclosure, and obtained a deed of the same, duly executed by the proper officer. Bugbee, the appellee, the plaintiff in the court below, recovered judgment against the estate of the mortgagor in 1843, and thereafter, pursuant to the altered law, tendered the purchase money, interest, and charges to Howard, the purchaser, and asked for a deed of the land, which was refused. A bill was filed in the court of chancery in Alabama by Bugbee to compel Howard to receive the money in redemption of the sale, and execute a deed. The defense was that the mortgage from Parsons, under which the defendant derived title as purchaser at the foreclosure sale, having been executed before the passage of the act providing for the redemption, the act, as respects this debt, was inoperative and void, as impairing the obligation of a contract. Now here was a case where the purchase was made at the foreclosure sale six years after the law had been enacted providing for redemption, and the question was raised, not by the mortgagor or the mortgagee, but by the purchaser at the sale. The Alabama court of chancery held that complainant was not entitled to the relief asked, and dismissed the bill; but \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n the supreme court of that state, upon appeal, reversed the decree of the court of chancery, and entered a decree for the complainant. Upom writ of error from this court is was here decided that the act of the legislature was invalid as an impairment of the mortgage contract, upon the authority of Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143, which had never decided the particular question.\n Upon principle, we cannot see how an independent purchaser, having no connection whatever with the mortgage, excepting as he becomes such pruchaser at the foreclosure sale, can raise the question in his own behalf in relation to the validity of legislation as to redemption and rate of interest which existed at the time he made his purchase; and this question, we think, has been clearly determined against the purchaser in the case of Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Cushman, \n108 U.S. 51\n, 27 L. ed. 648, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236.\n We have no disposition to revise the decision in that case, which, we think, was correct and stands upon a firm foundation. the later case of Barnitz v. Beverly, 41 L. ed. 93, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1042, when the facts therein are regarded, does not militate against the soundness of the views expressed in the Cushman Case, and in addition to that it was distinctly so stated in the opinion of the court. If a sale be made under a decree directing that it be without regard to the subsequent legislation, as in Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143, then the purchaser, buying under the decree with those specific directions, takes his rights thereunder. But in that case the decree is obtained in the interest, and at the request of, the mortgagee, and to save the impairment of his contract.\n In our view this independent purchaser must, under the facts herein, abide by the law as it stood at the time of his purchase.\n A further question is made by the plaintiff in error, that there was no proper tender made.\n Holding the views we do in regard to the main question, it follows that the amount of the bid made by the purchaser carried interest at the rate of 1 per cent per month only. If that amount, at that rate of interest, was tendered the sheriff, \n\n[194 U.S. 415, 427]\n\u00a0\n it was sufficient. The state court has found that such amount was paid to the sheriff by a check which was subsequently paid. Whether the defendant Rhodes fully complied with the requirements of the state statutes in order to make a complete tender is not a Federal question.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUGHTON v.

That the conditions upon which a publication shall be admitted to the second class are as follows:\n\n'First. It must regularly be issued at stated intervals, as frequently as four times a year, and bear a date of issue, and be numbered consecutively.\n\n'Second. It must be issued from a known office of publication.\n\n'Third. It must be formed of printed paper sheets, without board, cloth, leather, or other substantial binding, such as distinguish printed books for preservation from periodical publications.\n\n'Fourth. It must be originated and published for the dissemination of information of a public character, or devoted to \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n literature, the sciences, arts, or some special industry, and having a legitimate list of subscribers:\n\n'Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to admit to the second class rate regular publications, designed primarily for advertising purposes, or for free circulation, or for circulation at nominal rates.'\n\n And by the act of March 3, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 385, chap. 342, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2669), it was provided that second-class matter ( saving that excepted in  25) shall, on and after July 1, 1885, be entitled to transmission through the mails at 1 cent a pound or fraction thereof.\n Section 17 declared that mail matter of the third class shall embrace books, transient newspapers and periodicals, circulars, etc., and postage shall be paid at the rate of 1 cent for each two ounces or fractional part thereof.\n Are the publications of the Riverside Literature Series periodicals, and, therefore, belonging to the second class of mail matter, and entitled to transmission at the rate of 1 cent a pound, or books, as designated in the third class, and subject to postage at the rate of 1 cent for each two ounces?\n The publications are small books, 4 1\/2 by 7 inches, in paper covers, and are issued from the office of publication either monthly or quarterly, and numbered consecutively. Each number contains a single novel or story, or a collection of short stories or poems by the same author, and most, if not all of them, are reprints of standard works by Thackeray, Whittier, Lowell, Emerson, Irving, or other well-known writers, and from a literary point of view are of a high class. Each number is complete in itself and entirely disconnected with every other number. Upon the front page of the cover appear, at the top, the words 'Issued Monthly,' followed by the number of the serial and the date of issue. Below, the words 'Riverside Literature Series' are prominently displayed, and in the center of the page appears the name of the book. Each number complies with the conditions of  14, upon which the publication may be admitted to the second class, namely, \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n it is regularly issued at stated intervals, at least quarterly, and bears a date of issue, and is consecutively numbered. It is issued from a known office of publication; is formed of printed paper sheets, without board, cloth, or leather, or other substantial binding, and is published for the dissemination of information of a public character; or devoted to literature, etc. The bill also avers that the series has a legitimate list of subscribers, but does not aver that they were reading subscribers in the ordinary sense of the term. This distinction, however, is not pressed by the government. If the fact be that this series becomes a periodical by a compliance with the conditions of  14, under which it is entitled to be transmitted as second-class mail matter, we shall be compelled to say that the decree of the court below was wrong.\n But while  14 lays down certain conditions requisite to the admission of a publication as mail matter of the second class, it does not define a periodical, or declare that upon compliance with these conditions the publication shall be deemed such. In other words, it defines certain requisites of a periodical, but does not declare that they shall be the only requisites. Under  10 the publication must be a 'periodical publication,' which means, we think, that it shall not only have the feature of periodicity, but that it shall be a periodical in the ordinary meaning of the term. A periodical is defined by Webster as 'a magazine or other publication which appears at stated or regular intervals,' and by the Century dictionary as 'a publication issued at regular intervals in successive numbers or parts, each of which (properly) contains matter on a variety of topics and no one of which is contemplated as forming a book of itself.' By  10 newspapers are included within the class of periodical publications, although they are not so regarded in common speech. By far the largest class of periodicals are magazines, which are defined by Webster as 'pamphlets published periodically, containing miscellaneous papers or compositions.' A few other nondescript publications, such as railway guides, ap- \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n pearing at stated intervals, have been treated as periodicals and entitled to the privileges of second-class mail matter. Payne v. United States, 20 App. D. C. 581. Publications other than newspapers and periodicals are treated as miscellaneous printed matter, falling within the third class.\n While it may be difficult to draw an exact line of demarkation between periodicals and books, within which latter class the Riverside Literature Series falls, if not a periodical, it is usually, though not always easy to determine within which category it falls, if the character of a particular publication be put in issue.\n A periodical, as ordinarily understood, is a publication appearing at stated intervals, each number of which contains a variety of original articles by different authors, devoted either to general literature or some special branch of learning or to a special class of subjects. Ordinarily each number is incomplete in itself, and indicates a relation with prior or subsequent numbers of the same series. It implies a continuity of literary character, a connection between the different numbers of the series in the nature of the articles appearing in them, whether they be successive chapters of the same story or novel or essays upon subjects pertaining to general literature. If, for instance, one number were devoted to law, another to medicine, another to religion, another to music, another to painting, etc., the publication could not be considered as a periodical, as there is no connection between the subjects and no literary continuity. It could scarcely be supposed that ordinary readers would subscribe to a publication devoted to such an extensive range of subjects.\n A book is readily distinguishable from a periodical, not only because it usually has a more substantial binding (although this is by no means essential), but in the fact that it ordinarily contains a story, essay, or poem, or a collection of such, by the same author, although even this is by no means universal, as books frequently contain articles by different authors. Books are not often issued periodically, and, if so, their periodicity \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 98]\n\u00a0\n IS NOT AN ELEMENT OF THEIR CHARACTER. the reason why books of the riverside Literature Series are issued periodically is too palpable to require comment or explanation. It is sufficient to observe that, in our opinion, the fact that a publication is issued at stated intervals, under a collective name, does not necessarily make it a periodical. Were it not for the fact that they are so issued in consecutive numbers, no one would imagine for a moment that these publications were periodicals, and not books. While this fact may be entitled to weight in determining the character of the publication, it is by no means conclusive, when all their other characteristics are those of books rather than those of magazines.\n The fact that these publications are not bound when issued, or intended for preservation, is immaterial, since in France and most of the Continental countries nearly all books, even of the most serious and permanent character, are usually issued in paper covers, thus leaving each purchaser to determine for himself whether they are worth a binding of more substantial character, and preservation in his library. It is true that in this subdivision of  14 it is said that a periodical must be without such substantial binding as to distinguish printed books for preservation from periodical publications, but it is by no means to be inferred from this that to constitute a book the publication must have a substantial binding.\n Great stress is laid by counsel upon the original interpretation of the term 'periodical,' as applied to these books, which it is said was continued without change under different administrations and by several successive Postmasters General, and from 1879, the date of the passage of the act, until 1902, when the certificates granted by the former Postmasters General were revoked by the defendant and a different classification made of the publications now in issue; that the attention of Congress was repeatedly called to the evils and to the large expense incurred by the government by the admission of publications of this description to mail matter of the second class; that Congress seriously considered these representations, \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 99]\n\u00a0\n and committees made voluminous reports thereon, yet Congress persistently refused to change by legislation the ruling of the Postmasters General in that regard.\n We had occasion to consider this subject at length in the case of the United States v. Alabama G. S. R. Co. \n142 \nU.S. 615, 621\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1134, 1136, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306, in which we held that this court would look with disfavor upon a change whereby parties who have contracted with the government on the faith of a former construction might be injured; especially when it is attempted to make the change retroactive, and to require from a contractor a return of moneys paid to him under the former construction. This case is not open to the same objections. No contract with the government is set up whereby the latter agreed to carry these publications as second-class mail matter. Much less is any repayment demanded of money paid by the government under the prior construction. The action of the government consists merely in the revocation of a certificate or license admitting these publications as mail matter of the second class. No vested right having been created by such certificate, no contract can be said to be impaired by its revocation. East Saginaw Salt Mfg. Co. v. East Saginaw, 13 Wall. 373, 20 L. ed. 611; Grand Lodge, F. & A. M. v. New Orleans, \n166 \nU.S. 143, 147\n, 41 S. L. ed. 951, 952, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523. It was said, in that case, that the construction is one which, though inconsistent with the literalism of the act, certainly consorted with the equities of the case. Whereas in the case under consideration, if we are to believe the statements of counsel, which are not denied, the carriage of these publications as second-class mail matter entails annually an enormous loss upon the government and constitutes an odious discrimination between publishers of books and publishers of the so-called periodicals.\n But in addition to these considerations it is well settled that it is only where the language of the statute is ambiguous and susceptible of two reasonable interpretations that weight is given to the doctrine of contemporaneous construction. United States v. Graham, \n110 U.S. 219\n, 28 L. ed. 126, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582; United States v. Finnell, \n185 U.S. 236\n, 46 L. ed. 890, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633. Contemporaneous construction is a rule of inter- \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 100]\n\u00a0\n pretation, but is not an absolute one. It does not preclude an inquiry by the courts as to the original correctness of such construction. A custom of the Department, however, long continued by successive officers, must yield to the positive language of the statute. As was said in the Graham Case (p. 221, L. ed. p. 127, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 583), 'if there were ambiguity or doubt, then such a practice, begun so early and continued so long, would be in the highest degree persuasive, if not absolutely controlling, in its effect. But with the language clear and precise, and with its meaning evident, there is no room for construction, and consequently no need of anything to give it aid. The cases to this effect are numerous. Edwards v. Darby, 12 Wheat. 206, 6 L. ed. 603;United States v. Temple, \n105 U.S. 97\n, 26 L. ed. 967; Swift & C. & B. Co. v. United States, \n105 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 1108; Ruggles v. Illinois, \n108 U.S. 526\n, 27 L. ed. 812, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 832.' While it might well happen that by reason of the relative unimportance of the question when originally raised a too liberal construction might have been given to the word periodical, we cannot think that if this question had been raised for the first time after second-class mail matter had obtained its present proportions, a like construction would have been given. Some consideration in connection with the revocation of these certificates may properly be accorded to the great expense occasioned by this interpretation, and the discrimination in favor of certain publishers and against others, to which allusion has already been made. We regard publications of the Riverside Literature Series as too clearly within the denomination of books to justify us in approving a classification of them as periodicals, notwithstanding the length of time such classification obtained, and we are, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals was correct, and it is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan (with whom concurred the CHIEF JUSTICE) dissenting:\n The Chief Justice and myself are unable to concur in the opinion of the court. \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 101]\n\u00a0\n It was admitted at the bar that for more than sixteen years prior to May 5th, 1902, the Postoffice Department had acted upon the identical construction of the statute for which the appellants contend. During that period many different Postmasters General asked Congress to amend the statute so as to exclude from the mails, as second-class matter, such publications as those issued by the appellant, and which, under the present ruling of the Department are declared not to belong to that class of mailable matter. Again and again Congress refused to so amend the statute, although earnestly urged by the Department to do so.\n Representative Cannon, now Speaker of the House of Representatives, in a speech in opposition to the proposed change of the statute, explained the reasons that induced Congress to pass the act of March 3d, 1879, chap. 180 [20 Stat. at L. 355] U. S. 1 Rev. Stat. Supp. 245.1 He said: 'Before speaking on the merits of this bill, I wish to say to the gentleman from Georgia that, according to my recollection, by legislation advisedly had, prior to 1879, while I was a member of the Committee on the Postoffice and Post Roads, this class of literature was allowed to pass through the mails, the policy of that legislation being to encourage the dissemination of sound and desirable reading matter among the masses of the people of the country at cheap rates, both as to the cost of the books themselves and as to the postage. The question was discussed, unless my memory greatly misleads me, and the legislation was advisedly had. Under this legislation the best classes of literature-for instance, the Waverly Novels, Dickens's works, and the new translation of the Bible-have been sent by publishing houses unbound, stitched, so that they could be sold to the people at 10 cents a volume. As a consequence of this you may now find in the homes of our farmers and laboring men throughout the length and breadth of the country in this cheap form, issued at 10 cents per volume, a class of literature to which, prior to the adoption of this policy, some people in very good circumstances could scarcely have access.' Cong. Rec. vol. 19, p. 911. \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 102]\n\u00a0\n The result is that after the Department had, for sixteen years, construed the statute to mean what the appellants say it plainly means, and after Congress had uniformly refused, upon full investigation, to comply with the requests of Postmasters General to so amend the statute that it could be interpreted as the government now insists it should always have been interpreted, the Postoffice Department ruled, on May 5th, 1902, that the appellants' publications, known as the 'Riverside Literature Series,' could not go through the mails as secondclass matter. This ruling was made notwithstanding a postoffice official, having power to act in the premises, had issued to the appellants a certificate declaring that the 'Riverside Literature Series' had been determined by the Third Assistant Postmaster General to be a publication entitled to admission into the mails as second-class matter.\n Thus, by a mere order of the Department, that has been accomplished which different Postmasters General had held could not be accomplished otherwise than by a change in the language of the statute itself, which change, as we have said, Congress deliberately refused to make after hearing all parties concerned and after extended debate in each House.\n It has long been the established doctrine of this court that the practice of an executive department through a series of years should not be overthrown, unless such practice was obviously and clearly forbidden by the language of the statute under which it proceeded. In United States v. Finnell, \n185 \nU.S. 236, 244\n, 46 S. L. ed. 890, 893, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633, 636, which case related to certain fees claimed by a clerk of a court of the United States, this court said: 'It thus appears that the government has for many years construed the statute of 1887 as meaning what we have said it may fairly be interpreted to mean, and has settled and closed the accounts of clerks upon the basis of such construction. If the construction thus acted upon by accounting officers for so many years should be overthrown, we apprehend that much confusion might arise. Of course, if the departmental construction of the statute in question were obviously or clearly wrong, it \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 103]\n\u00a0\n would be the duty of the court to so adjudge. United States v. Graham, \n110 U.S. 219\n, 28 L. ed. 126, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582; Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. United States, \n164 U.S. 190\n, 41 L. ed. 399, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45. But if there simply be doubt as to the soundness of that construction,-and that is the utmost that can be asserted by the government,-the action during many years of the department charged with the execution of the statute should be respected, and not overruled except for cogent reasons. Edwards v. Darby, 12 Wheat. 206, 210, 6 L. ed. 603, 604; United States v. Philbrick, \n120 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 30 S. L. ed. 559, 561, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413; United States v. Johnston, \n124 \nU.S. 236, 253\n, 37 S. L. ed. 389, 396, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446; United States v. Alabama G. S. R. Co. \n142 \nU.S. 615, 621\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1134, 1136, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306. Congress can enact such legislation as may be necessary to change the existing practice, if it deems that course conducive to the public interests.'\n In our judgment, the appellants properly construe the statute. We think it obviously means just what the Department held it to mean for more than sixteen years. But the very utmost that the government can claim is that the statute in question is doubtful in its meaning and scope. The rule in such a case is not to disturb the long-continued practice of the Department in its execution of a statute, leaving to Congress to change it when the public interests require that to be done. But the Department, after being informed repeatedly by Congress that the change asked by Postmasters General would not be made, concluded to effect the change by a mere order that would make the statute mean what the practice of sixteen years, and the repeated action of Congress, had practically said it did not mean and was never intended to mean. This is a mode of amending and making laws which ought not to be encouraged or approved.\n It is suggested that the ruling of the Department was changed because of the increased expense attending the carrying, as second-class mailable matter, of such publications as those of the appellants. But how could the fact of such expense justify a change in the settled construction of a statute? That was a matter to which the attention of Congress was specially and frequently called, and yet it refused to modify \n\n[194 U.S. 88, 104]\n\u00a0\n the language of the statute. It was not the function of the Postmaster General to sit in judgment on the policy of legislation, and to determine the extent to which Congress should authorize the expenditure of public moneys. The question of expense was entirely for the legislative branch of the government.\n Something has also been said as to the discretion committed to the Postoffice Department in determining what is and what is not second-class mailable matter. But what about the discretion with which previous Postmasters General had been invested, when for many years they uniformly held that such publications as the plaintiffs' were second-class mailable matter? Is the discretion of one Postmaster General to be deemed of more importance than the discretion of five of his predecessors in office?\n In our opinion the law is for the appellants, and it should have been so adjudged. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 2646. \n\n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUMBIRD v. AVERY(1904)\n\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 480, 481]\n\u00a0\n This case was brought before us upon questions certified by the circuit court of appeals. Subsequently, the United States was allowed to intervene upon the general ground that the case involved important questions affecting the administration of the public land laws, including the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company then in process of adjustment. And on motion of the government, the plaintiffs and defendants concurring, the whole record was ordered to be sent up for our consideration.\n The case involves the title to numerous tracts of land situated on the line of the Northern Pacific Railway between Duluth and Ashland. The lands are described in an exhibit attached to the bill.\n The plaintiffs, Humbird and Weyerhaeuser, sue as grantees of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, a Wisconsin corporation, which, it is claimed, succeeded, in respect of the lands in dispute, to all the rights, interests, and ownership of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, created by the act of Congress of July 2d, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 365, chap. 217). They allege that the claims of the defendants constitute clouds upon their title. \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 482]\n\u00a0\n The defendants assert title under the land laws as settlers and purchasers from the United States, or grantees of such settlers and purchasers. But the bill alleges that the lands here in dispute are part of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and that the Land Department wrongfully and unlawfully permitted the entries under which the defendants severally claim. The circuit court dismissed the bill, but without prejudice, except as to all lands here involved for which patents had been issued. 110 Fed. 465.\n It seems both appropriate and necessary that the facts be fully stated. That statement we now proceed to make, premising that the present controversy had its origin, as will be presently shown, in conflicting orders or rulings in the Land Department as to what was the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad.\n By the above act of July 2d, 1864, chap. 217, Congress made a grant of lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from some point on Lake Superior, in Minnesota or Wisconsin, to some point on Puget sound, with a branch, via Columbia river, to a point at or near Portland. The act established indemnity limits not more than 10 miles beyond the limits of the alternate sections granted. 13 Stat. at L. 365.\n By a joint resolution approved May 31st, 1870, second indemnity limits were established within 10 miles on each side of the road, beyond the limits prescribed in the company's charter. 16 Stat. at L. 378, Resolution 67. The effect of this resolution was to allow the company, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to go into second indemnity limits in order to supply any deficiency in lands on its main line or branch.\n On the 3d day of July, 1882, the company transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior a map of definite location covering the proposed line from Thompson Junction, on the St. Paul & Duluth Railroad, near Duluth, Minnesota, to Ashland, in Wisconsin. That map was duly approved by the \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 483]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Interior, and the lands embraced by it were withdrawn from sale or entry.\n By resolution of the board of directors of the company, adopted August 28th, 1884, Ashland was declared to be the eastern terminus of the road; and that resolution was accepted by the Secretary on December 3d, 1884, as establishing such terminus.\n The part of the road delineated on the map of definite location was constructed and was duly accepted; and in conformity with the directions of the Secretary the company, the circuit court states, filed lists of selections of lands, some in the first and others in the second indemnity limits, in lieu of lands lost to it in its place limits,-such lists including all the lands in controversy in this suit. But the bill avers that no final action has ever been taken by the Land Department upon such lists; and they have not yet been approved by the Department.\n Subsequently, on August 12th, 1896, the Secretary of the Interior ruled that Duluth, not Ashland, was the eastern terminus of the railroad, and therefore that the land grant of 1864 did not embrace any lands between Duluth and Ashland. The company's lists of selections were thereupon canceled by order of the Secretary, and the lands covered by them were thereafter treated by the Department as unappropriated public lands, and were opened for sale and entry.\n This appears from an official communication addressed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, to the register and receiver at Duluth. In that communication the Commissioner said: 'On August 27th, 1896, the Secretary of the Interior rendered a decision wherein he held that the initial point on Lake Superior, or the eastern terminus of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, was at Duluth, Minnesota, and on December 24th, 1896, he approved a diagram prepared by this office showing the eastern terminal of the grant. On January 23d, 1897, a copy of so much of said \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n diagram as related to or affected lands within your district was transmitted to you for the use and guidance of your office. The decision of the Secretary aforesaid had the effect of restoring to the public domain all lands lying east of said terminal, which had theretofore been withdrawn on account of the grant to said railroad company. Therefore to the end that all persons interested may have an opportunity to present any claims they may have to any of these lands, you will cause to be published for the period of thirty days, in some newspaper of general circulation in their vicinity, a notice referring to said Secretary's decision, which in effect declared that all lands previously withdrawn on account of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and lying east of the terminal established at Duluth, are restored to the public domain and are subject to disposal at your office.'\n Under the above ruling of the Secretary as to the eastern terminus, the defendants were allowed to make entries and purchases on the line of the railroad between Duluth and Ashland, despite the company's map of definite location and the lists of selections filed by it with the Secretary. In reference to the action of the Interior Department, the circuit court said: 'By reason of the erroneous ruling of the Secretary of the Interior as to the location of the eastern terminus of said railroad, and his revocation of his prior approval of lawful selections by the railroad company of indemnity lands, and permitting sales and entries of such selected lands, as unappropriated, he had introduced confusion and conflict in respect to the right to such lands, which was beginning to be litigated in the courts. . . . The fact that patents had issued in a few instances would not end such disputes as to the lands so patented, as courts would adjudge the patentee in any case to hold the title in trust for the other party, wherever the other party had clearly the right to the land.' 110 Fed. 465, 469.\n Such was the situation when Congress incorporated into the body of the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1st, 1898 \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 485]\n\u00a0\n (30 Stat. at L. 597, 620, chap. 546), subdivision, Surveying the Public Lands, certain provisions relating to the Northern Pacific land grant. As these provisions disclose a scheme or plan for the settlement of the disputes arising out of the conflicting rulings in the Land Department in reference to the eastern terminus of the railroad, and its action in reference to the public lands between Duluth and Ashland, they should all be examined in order to ascertain the intention of Congress. They are therefore here given in full.\n By that act-dividing it, for convenience, into paragraphs-it was provided:\n'That where, prior to January first, eighteen hundred and ninety- eight, the whole or any part of an odd-numbered section, in either the granted or the indemnity limits of the land grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, to which the right of the grantee or its lawful successor is claimed to have attached by definite location or selection, has been purchased directly from the United States, or settled upon or claimed in good faith by any qualified settler under color of title or claim of right under any law of the United States or any ruling of the Interior Department, and where purchaser, settler, or claimant refuses to transfer his entry as hereinafter provided, the railroad grantee or its successor in interest, upon a proper relinquishment thereof, shall be entitled to select in lieu of the land relinquished an equal quantity of public lands, surveyed or unsurveyed, not mineral or reserved, and not valuable for stone, iron, or coal, and free from valid adverse claim, or not occupied by settlers at the time of such selection, situated within any state or territory into which such railroad grant extends, and patents shall issue for the land so selected as though it had been originally granted; but all selections of unsurveyed lands shall be of odd-numbered sections, to be identified by the survey when made, and patent therefor shall issue to and in the name of the corporation surrendering the lands before mentioned, and such patents shall not issue until after the survey: \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n 2. 'Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Interior shall from time to time ascertain, and, as soon as conveniently may be done, cause to be prepared and delivered to the said railroad grantee or its successor in interest a list or lists of the several tracts which have been purchased or settled upon or occupied as aforesaid, and are now claimed by said purchasers or occupants, their heirs or assigns, according to the smallest government subdivisions. And all right, title, and interest of the said railroad grantee or its successor in interest, in and to any of such tracts, which the said railroad grantee or its successor in interest may relinquish hereunder shall revert to the United States, and such tracts shall be treated, under the laws thereof, in the same manner as if no rights thereto had ever vested in the said railroad grantee, and all qualified persons who have occupied and may be on said lands as herein provided, or who have purchased said lands in good faith as aforesaid, their heirs and assigns, shall be permitted to prove their titles to said lands according to law, as if said grant had never been made; and upon such relinquishment said Northern Pacific Railroad Company or its lawful successor in interest may proceed to select, in the manner hereinbefore provided, lands in lieu of those relinquished, and patents shall issue therefor:\n\n\n 3. \n'Provided, further, That the railroad grantee or its successor in interest shall accept the said list or lists so to be made by the Secretary of the Interior as conclusive with respect to the particular lands to be relinquished by it, but it shall not be bound to relinquish lands sold or contracted by it, or lands which it uses or needs for railroad purposes, or lands valuable for stone, iron, or coal:\n\n 4. \n'And provided, further, That whenever any qualified settler shall in good faith make settlement in pursuance of existing law upon any odd- numbered sections of unsurveyed public lands within the said railroad grant to which the right of such railroad grantee or its successor in interest has attached, then, upon proof thereof satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior, \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n and a due relinquishment of the prior railroad right, other lands may be selected in lieu thereof by said railroad grantee or its successor in interest, as hereinbefore provided, and patents shall issue therefor:\n\n 5. \n'And provided, further, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as intended or having the effect to recognize the Northern Pacific Railway Company as the lawful successor of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company in the ownership of the lands granted by the United States to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, under and by virtue of foreclosure proceedings against said Northern Pacific Railroad Company in the courts of the United States, but the legal question whether the said Northern Pacific Railway Company is such lawful successor of the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company, should the question be raised, shall be determined wholly without reference to the provisions of this act, and nothing in this act shall be construed as enlarging the quantity of land which the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company is entitled to under laws heretofore enacted:\n\n 6. \n'And provided, further, That all qualified settlers, their heirs or assigns, who, prior to January first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, purchased, or settled upon or claimed in good faith, under color of title or claim of right under any law of the United States or any ruling of the Interior Department, any part of an odd-numbered section in either the granted or indemnity limits of the land grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, to which the right of such grantee or its lawful successor is claimed to have attached by definite location or selection, may in lieu thereof transfer their claims to an equal quantity of public lands, surveyed or unsurveyed, not mineral or reserved, and not valuable for stone, iron, or coal, and free from valid adverse claim, or not occupied by a settler at the time of such entry, situated in any state or territory into which such railroad grant extends, and make proof therefor as in other cases provided; and in making such proof, credit shall be given for the period of their bona fide residence and \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n amount of their improvements upon their respective claims in the said granted or indemnity limits of the land grant to the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company, the same as if made upon the tract to which the transfer is made; and before the Secretary of the Interior shall cause to be prepared and delivered to said railroad grantee or its successor in interest any list or lists of the several tracts which have been purchased or settled upon or occupied as hereinbefore provided, he shall notify the purchaser, settler, or claimant, his heirs or assigns, claiming against said railroad company, of his right to transfer his entry or claim, as herein provided, and shall give him or them option to take lieu lands for those claimed by him or them, or hold his claim and allow the said railroad company to do so under the terms of this act.' 30 Stat. at L. 597, 620.\n The provisions of that act were formally accepted in writing by the Northern Pacific Railway Company on the 13th of July, 1898, in writing, and such written acceptance was promptly transmitted by the company to the Secretary of the Interior.\n In a case in the supreme court of Wisconsin, determined shortly before the act of 1898, it was held, contrary to the ruling of the Interior Department in 1896, that Ashland, and not Duluth, was the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific Railway. Northern P. R. Co. v. Doherty, 100 Wis. 39, 75 N. W. 1079. Upon writ of error to this court that judgment was affirmed. Doherty v. Northern P. R. Co. \n177 U.S. 421\n, 44 L. ed. 830, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 677, and United States v. Northern P. R. Co. \n177 U.S. 435\n, 44 L. ed. 836, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 706.\n After the above decisions by this court-which were rendered April 16th, 1900-the Secretary of the Interior revoked the order canceling the company's above lists of selections, and reinstated them. Shortly before those cases were argued here, namely, on January 19th, 1900,-and apparently to meet the contingency of a reversal by this court of the judgment of the supreme court of Wisconsin,-the Northern Pacific Railway Company made conveyances with warranty to the \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 489]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs, Humbird and Weyerhaeuser, of all the lands aggregating more than 10,000 acres, the title to which is here in dispute. As appears from the record, these conveyances were made after the Land Department had issued regulations to facilitate the adjustment of claims under the act of July 1st, 1898. It should be recalled here that the lands covered by those conveyances were placed on the above list of selections filed by the railroad company, but those lists had not then, nor have they since, received the approval of the Secretary.\n It is contended by the plaintiffs that the result of the above decisions in this court, adjudging the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad to be at Ashland, Wisconsin, and not at Duluth, Minnesota, was that the odd-numbered alternate sections between Duluth and Ashland, on either side of the railroad, as definitely located, to the extent and within the limits prescribed, and not excluded from the grant of July 2d, 1864, were to be deemed public lands from which that grant could be supplied, and to which neither the defendants nor their grantors after the definite location of the road as shown by the company's accepted map of location could have acquired any valid title by entry or settlement, or by purchase, except from the railroad grantee, and that the defense cannot be maintained without violating the rights that were vested in the company in virtue of such definite location.\n The defendants, of course, combat this view of the rights of the parties, and insist that they are fully protected in their claims by the act of 1898, all the provisions of which, as we have seen, were accepted by the railroad company.\n In the statement accompanying the certified questions it is set forth that prior to the passage of the act of July 1st, 1898, the Secretary of the Interior had, pursuant to his original ruling as to the eastern terminus of the railroad, caused patents to be delivered to defendant settlers or their grantors for about 3,400 acres of the lands involved in this suit; that at the time of the passage of that act about 2,800 acres of the lands in question had been entered by defendant settlers or their \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 490]\n\u00a0\n grantors prior to January 1st, 1898, but no patents therefor had been issued; that after January 1st, 1898, the settlers or their grantors were permitted to enter about 5,000 acres of the lands here in controversy. The situation is thus described in the statement sent up by the circuit court of appeals: Of the lands claimed by the plaintiffs as successors in interest of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company about 3,400 acres thereof were held by the appellees under patents issued by the government prior to July 1st, 1898; for the residue of the lands the settlers held final receipts and final certificates, such final receipts and final certificates, as respects about 5,000 acres, being for tracts entered subsequent to January 1st, 1898. In reference to the lands for which final receipts and certificates have been issued nothing, so far as appears, remains to be done by the Land Department except the issuing of patents.\n The relief sought is a decree declaring, among other things, that the lands described in the exhibit attached to the bill, and all the timber standing or lying thereon, belong to the plaintiffs; that the entries, locations, final certificates, Land Office receipts, and patents, under which the several defendants claim, be adjudged to be void and removed as clouds from the titles of the plaintiffs, and the defendants severally enjoined from asserting any title by virtue thereof; and that such of the defendants as hold patents may be declared to hold as trustees for the plaintiffs in respect of any title conveyed by such patents, or any timber, cut or uncut, on such lands.\n The questions propounded to this court by the circuit court of appeals are these:\n'Is the act of July 1st, 1898, applicable to the determination of the rights of the parties to the 3,400 acres of land which were patented to the appellees or their predecessors in interest prior to the adoption of the act of July 1st, 1898?\n\n'Has the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota, or any court, jurisdiction as respects the lands in controversy entered subsequent to January 1st, 1898, and for which the settlers hold final receipts or certificates, \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 491]\n\u00a0\n to adjudicate the rights of the parties to this action in respect to said lands in advance of the issuance of patents therefor by the executive branch of the government, or should the courts decline jurisdiction until the government has devested itself of the legal title to the lands by the issuance and delivery of patents?'\n\n Messrs. William W. Billson, C. W. Bunn, Chester A. Congdon, H. Oldenburg, and James B. Kerr for Humbird et al.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 480, 494]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Frank L. Campbell, and Messrs. A.

Stanford for Lesure Lumber Company.\n Mr. Luther C. Harris for Olean Land Company and Alger, Smith & Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is appropriate at the outset to refer to certain allegations of the bill, which bring the determination of the case within a very narrow compass, and make it unnecessary to consider some matters referred to by counsel. After setting out in detail the various steps taken by the railroad company to acquire a right to the lands in dispute, the bill alleges that 'but for the vested rights' of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and its grantees the several tracts of land in question would have been unappropriated public lands open to the several kinds of entries or location made with respect to them, severally; also, that 'the several applications and proceedings with respect to the said several entries were in due form, and regularly conducted, as required by law, and, in the absence of the vested rights of the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company and its grantees in the said premises, would have been operative and effectual to invest the several entrymen of said lands with complete equitable title thereto, each of such entries and locations having been finally receipted for, allowed, and approved by the proper land officers of the United States; the only act \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 499]\n\u00a0\n remaining for the United States or its officers to perform with respect to such entries being the issuance of the patent in cases where the patent has not already issued;' and that all of the said entries and locations of lands referred to in the exhibit filed with the bill were allowed, and the final certificates (and, so far as issued, the patents) issued therefor, 'under a mistake of law founded upon a certain erroneous ruling by the Secretary of the Interior, to the effect that the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and their successors in interest, were not entitled to any lands by virtue of said act of Congress approved July 2d, 1864, and said joint resolution, approved May 31st, 1870, granting lands to said Northern Pacific Railroad Company, east of that point on the line of said Northern Pacific Railroad where the same crosses the line of the St. Paul & Duluth Railroad, known as Thompson Junction.'\n Obviously, the first inquiry should be as to the object and scope of the act of 1898. Upon that point we do not think any doubt can be entertained, if the words of the act be interpreted in the light of the situation as it actually was at the date of its passage, Here were vast bodies of land, the right and title to which was in dispute between a railroad company holding a grant of public lands, and occupants and purchasers,-both sides claiming under the United States. The disputes had arisen out of conflicting orders or rulings of the Land Department, and it became the duty of the government to remove the difficulties which had come upon the parties in consequence of such orders. The settlement of those disputes was therefore, as the circuit court said, a matter of public concern. If the disputes were not accommodated, the litigation in relation to the lands would become vexatious, extending over many years and causing great embarrassment. In the light of that situation Congress passed the act of 1898, which opened up a way for an adjustment upon principles that it deemed just and consistent with the rights of all concerned,-the government, the railroad grantee, and individual claimants. The railroad company evinced its approval of this \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 500]\n\u00a0\n action of the legislative department by a prompt acceptance of the act in its entirety. By such unqualified acceptance the railroad company agreed that, so far as it had any claim to the lands in dispute, whatever the act of Congress required to be done might be done.\n Promptly after the passage of that act the Land Department set about to administer its provisions, and to that end, as we have said, issued regulations for the guidance of all concerned.\n During the progress of this work of administration, the railroad company, by conveyances to the present plaintiffs, assumed to pass such interest as it had in the lands here in question, with the effect-it is now claimed by the plaintiffs-to withdraw or exempt all the lands so sold from the operation of the act. The plaintiffs rest this claim upon that part of the act providing that the railroad grantee or its successor in interest 'shall not be bound to relinquish lands sold or contracted by it, or lands which it uses or needs for railroad purposes, or lands valuable for stone, iron, or coal.' See above, par. 3.\n We have seen that the act (par. 1 above) made it the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain from time to time, and cause to be prepared and delivered to the railroad grantee or its successor in interest, a list or lists of the several tracts purchased, settled upon, or occupied, and claimed, at the date of the act, by such settlers, purchasers, or occupants, their heirs and assigns, according to the smallest government subdivisions. And the act provided that the railroad grantee or its successor should accept said list or lists 'as conclusive, with respect to the particular lands to be relinquished by it.' The contention of the plaintiffs, stated more fully, is, in effect, that it was competent for the company, notwithstanding its acceptance of the act, to take out of its operation any lands embraced by its terms, by simply selling or contracting to sell them before the delivery to it, or to its successor in interest, of the lists above mentioned. In other \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 501]\n\u00a0\n words,-for the contention comes to that,-the railroad company, so far as the act of 1898 was concerned, could, notwithstanding the acceptance of its provisions, and on the day after such acceptance, have sold or contracted to sell its right, title, and interest in and to all the lands embraced by those provisions. This would have left no lands whatever to which the act could apply. Such a result would have left unsettled all the disputes relating to any lands which the company chose, in its own interest, to sell while the Land Department was proceeding under the statute. We do not believe that Congress intended that it should be in the power of the railroad company in any such mode to defeat the operation of the act. Congress, manifestly, had reference to the situation as it was when the act of 1898 was passed.\n If any rights had become vested in the Northern Pacific Railroad Company which could not, against or without its consent, be affected by an enactment like that of 1898, then the objection to legislation on the ground that it interfered with vested rights, was waived by the acceptance of the act by its successor in interest; for it was entirely competent for the latter company, if it succeeded to all the rights of the railroad grantee, to agree to such a settlement as that devised by Congress. The rights acquired by the definite location of the road, and any selection of lands based thereon, became, upon the acceptance of the act, and so far as that company was concerned, subject to such settlement as the Land Department might legally make under that act. It could not, by any sale or contract made after the acceptance of the act, interfere with the full execution of its provisions. And the plaintiffs, who claim to have purchased from the successor in interest of the railroad grantee, can occupy no better position than the company from which they purchased. They were in a sense purchasers pendente lite; for the Secretary of the Interior was, at the time, as he is now, engaged in administering the act of Congress. By him or under his direction must be ascertained the facts upon which depend the inquiry whether \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 502]\n\u00a0\n lands in question are within the indemnity limits of the land grant to the railroad company, and so situated that a right to them attached by reason of the definite location of the road. He must also inquire whether such lands were purchased, by the respective defendants, directly from the United States, or were settled upon or claimed in good faith by qualified settlers under color of title or claim of right under a law of the United States or ruling of the Interior Department, and whether the purchaser, settler, or claimant refuses to transfer his entry. Upon these facts also depends the right of the railroad grantee or its successor in interest ( its rights being relinquished as provided in the act) to select, in lieu of the lands relinquished, an equal quantity of surveyed or unsurveyed public lands, not mineral or reserved, and not valuable for stone, iron, or coal, and free from any adverse claim, or not occupied by settlers at the time of such selection, situated within any state or territory into which the railroad grant extends.\n Now it is sought, in advance of final action by the Land Department in execution of the act, to have it adjudged, as between the parties to this suit, that the lands in dispute, claimed by the defendants, cannot properly be placed on the lists which the Secretary may deliver to the railroad grantee or its successor in interest. But that is a question the solution of which depends, in part at least, on facts within the province, primarily, of the Secretary of the Interior to find. In short, he, and he alone, must ascertain the facts which enter into the question as to what lands are to go on the lists to be delivered to the railroad grantee or its successor in interest. The court should not, by any decree, as between parties who have no contract relations with each other, attempt indirectly to control the authority and discretion of that officer to determine what lands shall be what lands shall not be included in the lists to be prepared under his direction. The plaintiffs cannot invoke the aid of the court to have these questions concluded, even as between them and the defendants, by an admission, made in their bill for the purposes of this case, that the final \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 503]\n\u00a0\n certificates and final receipts held by the respective defendants will entitle them to the lands they claim but for the 'vested' rights acquired by the railroad company in virtue of the definite location of its road. The court should not assume that they are embraced by the act, in order simply that it may have an opportunity, as between the present parties, to decide a question of law which cannot appropriately arise until at least all the facts are ascertained by the Land Department, and final action is taken under the statute of 1898. Although it may be true, as alleged in the bill, that the defendants, not holding patents, have received and hold final certificates or final receipts, and that, so far as they are concerned, nothing more remains to be done in the Department except to issue patents, yet it is in the power of the Department, even after decree here, in this suit, to reopen the case as to each defendant of that class, and, sufficient grounds existing therefor, recall or cancel such certificates or receipts. The whole matter, in respect of the lands in dispute, is yet in the hands of the Department, undisposed of finally under the act of 1898. Congress intended that the Department should, within the limit and according to the rules prescribed by the act of 1898, settle the disputes that had arisen between the railroad grantee and settlers, although, after the matter has passed beyond the jurisdiction of the Department, such settlements may become the subject of judicial inquiry for the protection of the rights of parties against any error of law committed by the Department.\n Those views are in entire accord with the former decisions of this court. In Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 87, 20 L. ed. 485, 488, it was said: 'This court has at all times been careful to guard itself against an invasion of the functions confided by law to other departments of the government, and in reference to the proceedings before the officers intrusted with the charge of selling the public lands it has frequently and firmly refused to interfere with them in the discharge of their duties, either by mandamus or injunction, so long as the title remained in the \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 504]\n\u00a0\n United States and the matter was rightfully before those officers for decision. On the other hand, it has constantly asserted the right of the proper courts to inquire, after the title had passed from the government, and the question became one of private right, whether, according to the established rules of equity and the acts of Congress concerning the public lands, the party holding that title should hold absolutely as his own, or as trustee for another.' So, in Marquez v. Frisbie, \n101 \nU.S. 473, 475\n, 25 S. L. ed. 800, 801: 'We have repeatedly held that the courts will not interfere with the officers of the government while in the discharge of their duties in disposing of the public lands, either by injunction or mandamus. . . . After the United States has parted with its title and the individual has become vested with it, the equities subject to which he holds it may be enforced, but not before. . . . We did not deny the right of the courts to deal with the possession of the land prior to the issue of the patent, or to enforce contracts between the parties concerning the land. But it is impossible thus to transfer a title which is yet in the United States.' What was said in the case just cited, as to the power of the court to interfere, in certain cases, in advance of the issuing of the patent, was no doubt in the mind of the circuit court when, in its opinion in this case, it said: 'It is unnecessary to decide whether a case may not arise, when, even while the disputed question as to the rights of contesting parties to a tract of public land is pending or cognizable before the Land Department, a court of equity may properly interfere by injunction, at the suit of one of the claimants, to prevent the other claimant from despoiling the land by waste, and appropriating its substantial value, by denuding it of all its merchantable timber, before any final decision upon the disputed claims by the Land Department, which is only rendered by issuing the patent.'\n So, again, in United States v. Schurz, \n102 \nU.S. 378, 395\n, 26 S. L. ed. 167, 171: 'The Constitution of the United States declares that Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 505]\n\u00a0\n and regulations respecting the territory and other property belonging to the United States. Under this provision the sale of the public lands was placed by statute under the control of the Secretary of the Interior. To aid him in the performance of this duty a bureau was created, at the head of which is the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with many subordinates. To them, as a special tribunal, Congress confided the execution of the laws which regulate the surveying, the selling, and the general care of these lands. Congress has also enacted a system of laws, by which rights to these lands may be acquired and the title of the government conveyed to the citizen. This court has with a strong hand upheld the doctrine that so long as the legal title to these lands remained in the United States, and the proceedings for acquiring it were as yet in fieri, the courts would not interfere to control the exercise of the power thus vested in that tribunal. To that doctrine we still adhere.' As late as Bockfinger v. Foster, \n190 \nU.S. 116, 126\n, 47 S. L. ed. 975, 979, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836, 840, we reaffirmed the principle 'that the courts will not interfere with the Land Department in its control and disposal of the public lands, under the legislation of Congress, so long as the title in any essential sense remains in the United States.'\n These principles are applicable to the particular scheme devised by the act of 1898 in reference to the lands in dispute. When the Land Department shall have done all that it can do in execution of the act of Congress, as to any particular lands in dispute, it will be time enough for itnerested private parties claiming an interest in them to invoke the aid of the courts for the determination of such questions of law as may arise out of the action of the Department. It is true that no order is asked here that will, directly or in terms, operate upon the Land Department. But a decree is asked, as between the parties now before the court, which must necessarily control or affect the action of the Department in respect of matters committed to it by Congress. Such interference by the court, although between private claimants only, would be in- \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 506]\n\u00a0\n appropriate,-especially as to lands covered by the act of 1898\n\n\n What has been said is peculiarly applicable to the unpatented lands in dispute. It is equally applicable to lands patented both before and after the passage of the act, if such lands are in dispute and belong to either of the classes described in the act of 1898. We agree with the circuit court that the act 'gives the option to keep or relinquish the disputed land, to the individual claimant in every instance. If he elects to retain that land, it is to be listed by the Secretary in lists to be furnished to the railroad claimant, who must relinquish, and whose consent to this was given by its acceptance of the act.' In case of such relinquishment by the railroad company, it acquires a right to select other lands in place of those retained by the individual claimant. If the individual claimant, having a patent, elects to surrender his right, then he must reconvey to the United States, and will then be entitled to select other lands in lieu of those surrendered. So that the statute embraces both patented and unpatented lands, in respect of which the railroad company or its successor in interest claims that a right thereto attached by the definite location of its road or by selection, provided they are also such lands as were originally 'purchased directly from the United States, or settled upon or claimed in good faith by any qualified settler under color of title or claim of right under any law of the United States or any ruling of the Interior Department.' The duty of a court of equity not to interfere with parties in the prosecution of their rights under the act, whereby the execution of its provisions in advance of final action by the Department would be embarrassed by judicial decision, is quite as imperative in cases of the patented lands in dispute as in the cases of unpatented lands. This view is not at all in conflict with those cases in which it has been held that after a patent issued for public lands the only remedy for one who claims the land as against the patentee is to bring a suit against the person holding the patent, and obtain a decree de- \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 507]\n\u00a0\n claring the patentee a trustee for the party suing. This general principle does not apply to cases embraced by the act of 1898. That act is peculiar in its provisions, and contemplates that the individual claimant of one of the classes described in it may hold the land patented to him, if he elects to retain it, and that the railroad grantee or its successor in interest can be made whole by taking lieu lands in place of those claimed in virtue of definite location or selection.\n For the reasons stated, neither the claim of vested rights in behalf of the railroad grantee, nor the contention that the lands in dispute, having been sold to the plaintiffs, were not for that reason embraced by the act of 1898, furnishes any ground for interference by a court of equity, or for the granting of the relief asked.\n This conclusion is fortified, if not absolutely demanded, by another consideration, namely, that no title to indemnity lands is vested until a selection be made by which they are definitely ascertained, and the selection made approved by the Secretary of the Interior. This principle is firmly established. A full statement of it is found in Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 \nU.S. 496, 511\n, 33 S. L. ed. 687, 694, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 347. The court there said: 'He [the Secretary] was required to determine, in the first place, whether there were any deficiencies in the land granted to the company, which were to be supplied from indemnity lands; and, in the second place, whether the particular indemnity lands selected could be properly taken for those deficiencies. In order to reach a proper conclusion on these two questions he had also to inquire and determine whether any lands in the place limits had been previously disposed of by the government, or whether any pre-emption or homestead rights had attached before the line of the road was definitely fixed. . . . Until the selections were approved there were no selections in fact, only preliminary proceedings taken for that purpose; and the indemnity lands remained unaffected in their title. Until then the lands which might be taken as indemnity were incapable of identification; the proposed selections remained the \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 508]\n\u00a0\n property of the United States. The government was, indeed, under a promise to give the company indemnity lands in lieu of what might be lost by the causes mentioned. But such promise passed no title, and, until it was executed, created no legal interest which could be enforced in the courts.' In New Orleans P. R. Co. v. Parker, \n143 \nU.S. 42, 57\n, 36 S. L. ed. 66, 70, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 364, 369, it was said: 'As to lands within the indemnity limits, it has always been held that no title is acquired until the specific parcels have been selected by the grantee and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.' And in Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 593 S., 42 L. ed. 591-593, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208, 209, the court said: 'Generally speaking, while the legal title remains in the United States, the grant is in process of administration and the land is subject to the jurisdiction of the Land Department of the government.' To the same effect are Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. \n117 \nU.S. 406, 408\n, 29 S. L. ed. 928, 929, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790; United States v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. \n141 \nU.S. 358, 374\n, 35 S. L. ed. 766, 771, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13; Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 \nU.S. 473, 479\n, 43 S. L. ed. 772, 775, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485; Kansas P. R. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. \n112 \nU.S. 414, 421\n, 28 S. L. ed. 794, 797, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208; Barney v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n117 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 29 S. L. ed. 858, 860, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654; Grinnell v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. \n103 U.S. 739\n, 26 L. ed. 456; St. Paul & S. C. R. Co. v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n112 \nU.S. 720, 731\n, 28 S. L. ed. 872, 876, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 334; Cedar Rapids & M. River R. Co. v. Herring, \n110 U.S. 27\n, 28 L. ed. 56, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485.\n Now, the lands here in dispute and claimed by the plaintiffs as grantees of the Northern Pacific Railway Company (the alleged successor in interest of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company) are lands admittedly within indemnity, as distinguished from granted or place, limits. The mere filing of lists of selections, after the acceptance of the map of definite location of the railroad line between Duluth and Ashland, gave the company no such title as could be enforced by the courts in a suit between private parties. It is true the government was under a promise to give the railroad company lands in the indemnity limits to supply losses in place limits. But, as adjudged in the above cases, that promise passed no title. The promise will no doubt be fulfilled by the govern- \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 509]\n\u00a0\n ment in due time and in its own way. The selections not having been approved by the Secretary, the title remains in the government. So that the plaintiffs, having no greater rights than those of the railroad grantee or its successor, have no such interest in the particular lands specified in the railroad company's lists of unapproved selection as entitles it, while the title remains in the United States, and while these lands are being administered by the Land Department, to ask a court of equity to decide, as between them and the defendants, that the latter could not by any entry or purchase acquire an interest after the acceptance by the Secretary of the railroad's map of definite location.\n But it is suggested that the final action of the Department may be indefinitely postponed, to the great injury of the railroad grantee and those claiming under it. Delay in such matters was a contingency which the alleged successor in interest of the railroad grantee must have taken into account when accepting the act and assenting to the plan of settlement embodied in it. The Land Department was not required to complete its administration of the statute within any designated time. The act, upon its face, directs that the required lists be prepared and delivered to the railroad company 'as soon as conveniently may be done.' It cannot be assumed upon this record that the Department has not progressed with the work of administration as rapidly as all the circumstances and its convenience permitted. Even if the fact be otherwise, it is not for a court of equity by its decree to decide, in the first instance, that the selections made by the railroad company of lieu lands shall be approved by the Secretary, or to decide what lands should be on the lists required to be furnished to the railroad, granted under the act of 1898, or to control directly or indirectly the work which Congress, with the assent of the railroad grantee, has committed to one of the Departments of the government, or by an order interfere with the prosecution by the defendants of their claims under the act of 1898. \n\n[195 U.S. 480, 510]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that the bill should have been dismissed upon the ground that a court of equity should not, in advance of the final action by the Secretary of the Interior in respect of lands embraced by the act of 1898, interfere with the regular and orderly administration of its provisions by means of a decree directed against claimants under that act. And without now expressing any opinion as to what questions may be raised by a claimant after such final action by the Land Department under that act, we adjudge that such dismissal must be without prejudice to any suit that may, according to established principles, be rightfully instituted by a claimant after the jurisdiction of the Department in respect of any particular lands has ceased. Thus modified, the decree of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUNSAKER v.

Duvall for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The sole question presented by the record in this case is whether the provision in the policy for the unconditional ownership of the property by the plaintiff, and for the nonexistence of any chattel mortgage thereon, was broken by certain trust deeds to secure the payment of money in each case.\n Plaintiff relies upon the familiar principle of law that the \n\n[196 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n conditions of a policy of insurance, prepared, as they are, by the company, and virtually thrust upon the insured, frequently without his knowledge, must be construed strictly, and, while the legal effect of a chattel mortgage and of a deed of trust to secure the payment of money may be practically the same, they are in law different instruments; and that a condition against one is not broken by the existence of the other. We recognize the rule laid down by this court in Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co. \n136 U.S. 287\n, 34 L. ed. 408, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1019, that in case of attempted forfeiture, if the policy be fairly susceptible of two constructions, the one will be adopted which is more favorable to the insured. This rule was reiterated in McMaster v. New York L. Ins. Co. \n183 U.S. 25\n, 46 L. ed. 64, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, but we cannot recognize it as applicable to this case.\n A deed of trust and chattel mortgage with power of sale are practically one and the same instrument as understood in this District. In the language of Mr. Justice Morris, in speaking of mortgages of real estate in Middleton v. Parke, 3 App. D. C. 149:\n'The deed of trust is the only form of mortgage that has been in general use in the District of Columbia for many years. The common-law mortgage is practically unknown with us; and everyone understands that, when a mortgage of real estate here is spoken of, the deed of trust is what is intended. . . . The deed of trust is here used as the equivalent of a mortgage; and so the term is universally used by the community. Indeed, while a mortgage is not necessarily, perhaps, a deed of trust, a deed of trust to secure the loan of money is necessarily a mortgage.'\n\n It was said by this court in Shillaber v. Robinson, \n97 U.S. 68\n-78, 24 L. ed. 967-970, that, 'if there is a power of sale, whether in the creditor or in some third person to whom the conveyance is made for that purpose, it is still in effect a mortgage, though in form a deed of trust; and may be foreclosed by sale in pursuance of the terms in which the power is conferred, or by suit in chancery.' \n\n[196 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n The legal effect of the two instruments had been recognized as practically the same in several cases in this and other courts. Platt v. Union P. R. Co. \n99 U.S. 48\n-57, 25 L. ed. 424-427; Palmer v. Gurnsey, 7 Wend. 248; Eaton v. Whiting, 3 Pick. 484; Wheeler & W. Mfg. Co. v. Howard, 28 Fed. 741; Bartlett v. Teah, 1 McCrary, 176, 1 Fed. 768; Southern P. R. Co. v. Doyle, 8 Sawy. 60, 11 Fed. 253; McLance v. Paschal, 47 Tex. 365.\n There may be cases under particular statutes recognizing a difference between them in reference to the application of the recording laws, as appears to be the case in Maryland (Charles v. Clagett, 3 Md. 82), but in their essential features and in their methods of enforcement they are practically identical. Both are transfers conditioned upon the payment of a sum of money; both are enforceable in the same manner, and the difference between them is one of name rather than substance. The provision in the policy is one for the protection of the insurer, who is entitled, if he insists upon it in his questions, to be apprised of any fact which qualifies or limits the interest of the insured in the property, and would naturally tend to diminish the precautions he might take against its destruction by fire.\n In passing upon the identity of the two instruments in this case we may properly refer to the further provision of the policy that the interest of the insured must be an unconditional and sole ownership. While the breach of this condition is not specifically urged in the briefs, we may treat it as explanatory of the other condition against the existence of a chattel mortgage. The company evidently intended by this provision to protect itself against conditional transfers of every kind. The contract of the company is a personal one with the insured, and it is not bound to accept any other person to whom the latter may transfer the property.\n The conditions of the policy in this case were broken by the trust deeds, and the judgment of the court below is, therefore, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUNTINGTON v.

Issue being joined in the case, it was referred to a special examiner to ascertain and report the facts, and upon his report the circuit court gave judgment in favor of appellee (110 Fed. 60), which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (55 C. C. A. 216, 119 Fed. 114), and the appellant thereupon appealed here.\n The action was brought pursuant to the authority of an act of Congress (before amendment) passed in 1894, chapter 290. 28 Stat. at L. 286, 305; amended, 31 Stat. at L. 760, chap. 217. The right to the allotment claimed by the appellee is based on the act of March 3, 1885, chapter 319 (23 Stat. at L. 340), and grows out of the treaty of June 9, 1855, between the United States and that Walla Walla and other Indian tribles, which treaty was ratified by the Senate, March 8, 1859, and proclaimed by the President, April 11, 1859. 12 Stat. at L. 945.\n A demurrer to the bill was filed by the defendant on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was overruled and the defendant then answered, denying many of the material allegations in the bill.\n Witnesses were examined before the special examiner, and he made a report and findings of facts, which findings were subsequently adopted by the circuit court and by the circuit court of appeals. Among others the following facts were found: The appellee, Philomme Smith, is a full- blooded Indian woman, and at all times mentioned in the complaint was, and is now, a member of the Walla Walla band or tribe of Indians, and resides upon the Umatilla Indian reservation, in the state of Oregon. The befendant (appellant) is also a full-blooded Indian, residing upon the reservation. Pursuant to the authority granted by the abovementioned act of March 3, 1885, \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n the President appointed commissioners for the allotment of lands on the Umatilla reservation, and the commissioners carried out the duty devolved upon them by the President under that act, and completed the allotments on or about April 1, 1891, but refused at that time to make any allotment to the appellee, because of her absence (although but temporary) when the commissioners made a census of the Indians entitled to allotment. At the time the other allotments were made the appellee was the wife of W. A. Smith, a white man, and she was also the real head of the family, which consisted of the husband, his wife, and their eight children. The parties were married January 16, 1861, and the appellee has been recognized by the Interior Department as the head of the family in the sense mentioned in the act of Congress of 1885\n\n\n At the time the allotments were made to the other Indians by the commissioners, as above mentioned, appellee was located and actually residing with her family upon the reservation, upon a large tract of land, some 560 acres, including the land in controversy herein, and she and her family at that time were living in a house about twenty steps from the boundary line of this particular 160 acres. The land (including the 160 acres) was inclosed in one body by having a furrow plowed around the same, marking it off from the other adjacent land. The appellee had selected the land in 1888, and, with her family, was then in possession thereof, and retained such possession until the fall of 1896, with the consent of Homily, chief of the Walla Walla Indians, and Show-a-way, chief of the Cayuse Indians, and also with the consent of _____ Coffee, who was at that time acting as Indian agent upon that Indian reservation.\n Since 1888, and prior to the time when the allotment to defendant was made, the appellee made valuable improvements upon and around the land in question, by building upon it a small cabin and a barn, and making other improvements, and by putting a wire fence around the whole tract, the whole cost amounting to between $700 and $775, and from April, 1888 \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n until the fall of 1896, long after the allotments were made by the commissioners, the appellee and her family had possession of the land in question with the improvements thereon, and she and her family continued to live during that time in the house, about twenty steps from the boundary line of this land. When the appellee left the land in the fall of 1896, she left it because she was ordered to do so by the then Indian agent, pursuant to a determination by the Interior Department, made in 1893, that she was not entitled to any allotment under the act of 1885.\n Before the land was allotted to the defendant, and while the allotting commissioners were engaged in allotting lands in 1891, as above stated, the appellee asked to be allotted the particular 160 acres in controversy in this case by the commissioners, but they declined to do so because her name was not upon their allotting list. The defendant obtained possession of the 160 acres in October, 1896, and the land was allotted to him at that time, when appellee was ordered off the same by the Indian agent, and the defendant has never paid the appellee any money or in any manner reimbursed her for the improvements which she had made upon the lands in controversy, and the defendant had made no improvements thereon, and was aware of all that had been done by appellee when he made the selection of this land, and when it was allotted to him. There is neither allegation nor proof that appellant has since made any improvements on the land.\n In April, 1897, the Department of the Interior reconsidered its former decision, and held that appellee was entitled to an allotment of land upon the reservation, and it directed one G. W. Harper, the then Indian agent of that Indian reservation, to make an allotment to her, and, pursuant to that direction, Harper called upon her to make a selection of lands for her allotment, and she thereupon selected certain lands, which were not the lands in question, the land selected amounting to 146.2 acres in all, and she was recognized by the Department as the head of a family, entitled to make selection and \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n have an allotment. A part of this land she has since leased to a tenant, and has accepted rental from the tenant, the lease covering only 70 acres.\n The land selected by the appellee after she had been forced to relinquish the possession of the 160 acres was not as valuable as the land from which she was ordered, and at the time the selection of this other land was made by her she and her husband came to the office of the Indian agent and asked him if it would affect her rights in the land in question for her to select land as directed by the Indian commissioner. She was told by the agent that he thought it would not; that she was under orders from an officer, and not under her own free will, when she left the land, and it was taken possession of by the defendant; and with that understanding the appellee made the selection of the other and less valuable land.\n The particular relief asked by the appellee in her bill was a decree declaring her 'to be the allottee upon the said tract of land, and that the allotment thereof to the defendant be canceled and annulled, and that the defendant, his servants, and all persons holding under him, as tenants, lessees, or otherwise, be forever enjoined from interfering with your orator's possession thereof, and that she may have judgment against the defendant for damages,' etc.\nMessrs. John C. Gittings, Samuel Herrick, and Hailey & Dowell for appellant. \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 406]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. J. Slater and J. T. Hinkle for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the above statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first objection made by counsel for the appellant is that the act of Congress of August 15, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 286, 305, chap. 290), under which the complainant instituted this suit, is not applicable to this case, and, therefore, the court has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter. The objection made by the appellant is, that to make the act applicable to the appellee would be to give it a retrospective effect, while its purpose is plainly prospective. The objection is untenable.\n The appellee claims that under the act of 1885 she was entitled to an allotment of land in the Umatilla reservation, and that it was improperly refused her. The act provides ([28 Stat. at L. chap. 290] p. 305): 'That all persons who are in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent, who are entitled to an allotment of land under any law of Congress, or who claim to be so entitled to land under any allotment act or under any grant made by \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 408]\n\u00a0\n Congress, or who claim to have been unlawfully denied or excluded from any allotment or any parcel of land to which they claim to be lawfully entitled by virtue of any act of Congress, may commence and prosecute or defend any action, suit, or proceeding in relation to their right thereto in the proper circuit court of the United States.'\n That this act embraces the case of a person situated as was the appellee at the commencement of this suit seems to us so plain as to require no further argument. It is not in any way a retrospective operation which is thus given to the act, except as it applies, by its language, to any one who was then (at the time of the passage of the act of 1894) entitled to an allotment. She claims that she was so entitled to an allotment of the land in question, and that it had been improperly alloted to defendant (appellant), and that the act permits her to assert her claim in the circuit court, as against the appellant, and to have it adjudged between them. We have no doubt she has that right.\n The next objection is that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that it fails to allege the residence of the complainant (appellee) on the reservation at the time of the passage of the allotment act (1885), and shows upon its face that her claim for this allotment was decided against her by the Secretary of the Interior in 1891, long prior to the passage of the act of 1894, under which she is now suing, and when the sole authority for setting disputes concerning allotments resided with the Secretary of the Interior.\n We are of opinion that it was not necessary to allege or prove the residence of the appellee on the reservation at the time of the passage of the act of 1885, called the 'Allotment Act.' That act had reference, as its preamble states, to the 'Confederated bands of Cayuse, Walla Walla, and Umatilla Indians, residing upon the Umatilla reservation, in the state of Oregon.'\n It related to the residence of the bands as bands, and not as individual Indians, many of whom were residing off the par- \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 409]\n\u00a0\n ticular reservation and yet within the country theretofore ceded to the United States by the treaty of 1855. Under the act mentioned a commission was appointed by the President, the members of which were to go upon the reservation and ascertain as near as might be the number of Indians who would remain on that reservation and who should be entitled to take lands in severalty thereon, and the amount of land required to make the allotment, and the commission was then to determine and set apart so much of their reservation as should be necessary to supply agricultural lands for allotments in severalty. The commission was to report to the Secretary of the Interior the number and classes of persons entitled to allotment as near as they might be able to do so, and if the report were approved by the Secretary of the Interior the tracts selected should thereafter constitute that reservations for those Indians, and within which the allotments provided for in the act should be made.\n Under this act a report had been made to the Secretary of the Interior by the commission some time after the conclusion of their labors in the Indian countries in 1891, and an opinion was asked by the Department of the Interior from the Assistant Attorney General regarding the rights of the appellee, among others, to an allotment under that act, which had been refused by the commission. An opinion was delivered on July 1, 1893, by one of the Assistant Attorneys General, in which he held that the appellee was not entitled to an allotment; but upon reviewing that opinion, on June 28, 1895, he held that she was entitled thereto. In his latter opinion he thought that while it was agreed in the treaty of 1855, already mentioned in the statement of facts, that the Indians should remove within one year to the permanent reservation (which, in this case, was the Umatilla reservation), yet there was no penalty affixed to its violation, and the failure of the Indians to so remove and reside would not work a forfeiture of their tribal rights, and that, while the appellee was not residing upon this reservation at the time that the act of 1885 became operative, she was, \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 410]\n\u00a0\n so far as that fact was concerned, in the same position as a majority of the Indians belonging to the confederated tribes mentioned in the act; that the record showed that when the agents of the government went on this reservation they found but few Indians actually residing there, and it was only after weeks of sending out runners and using all the means at their disposal, that the commissioners succeeded in securing the attendance of a majority of the male adults of these tribes. The Assistant Attorney General gave the opinion that that was itself a recognition by the Department that residence upon the reservation was not essential to tribal recognition.\n It is plain that the agreement in the treaty of 1855, by which the tribes and bands agreed to remove to, and settle upon, the reservation within one year after the ratification of this treaty, had not been lived up to so far as actual residence upon the reservation of individual Indians was concerned. Thirty years after that time, when the act of 1885 was passed, it is seen that a majority of the Indians were not even then actually residing, in the strict sense of the term, upon this reservation. There existed under the treaty an exclusive right among the Indians of taking fish from the streams running through and bordering upon the reservation, and at all other usual and accustomed stations, in common with the citizens of the United States, and the privilege of erecting suitable buildings for curing such fish, and also the right of pasturing their stock on unclaimed lands in common with the citizens of the United States, was secured to them. The right to roam over so much of the territory as was ceded by them to the government, as they had been accustomed to do, and such as were not settled upon or claimed for individual use by citizens of the United States, seems to have been recognized, or to have been expected by the government, although the residence of the tribe or band as such was to be within the reservation mentioned in the treaty. It was also said in the opinion regarding the facts in this case:\n'The trouble with these claimants seems to have arisen out \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 411]\n\u00a0\n of their failure to be upon the reservation when the census roll of the tribe was made up. They arrived at said reservation in reply to the communication sent to them by one of the Indians the day after the census takers had left the reservation, to wit, on the 7th day of June, 1887, or rather Mrs. Morisette arrived upon that day and Mrs. Smith shortly afterwards. They were recognized by Homily, chief of the Walla Wallas, and various other head men and members of the confederated tribes, and the Indian agent then in charge assigned each one of them to a parcel of land, after selection, and they have made valuable improvements on and have continued to reside thereon, as far as this record shows, ever since, the value of their improvements amounting to a considerable sum. They began residence upon the land about the middle of June, and their reasons for not having arrived sooner, that they lived some 200 miles away, and were without money to make the trip.'\n\n Pursuant to this opinion of the Assistant Attorney General, the Department of the Interior reconsidered its former decision, and held that the appellee was entitled to an allotment under the act of 1885. We concur with the latter opinion of the Assistant Attorney General, and hold that it was not necessary that the individual Indians of the tribes mentioned in the act of 1885 should be actually residing on the reservation at the time of the passage of that act. If the individual were a member of the tribe or band, recognized as such by his chiefs, it was not necessary that such person should be an actual resident of the reservation when the act was passed. The fact found is that the appellee herein is a full-blooded Indian woman, and was, at all the times mentioned, a member of the Walla Walla band or tribe of Indians, and at the time of the original allotment resided upon the reservation in the state of Oregon. When such a large percentage of allottees upon this reservation resided, as did the appellee, elsewhere than actually upon the reservation at the date of the passage of the act of 1885, it cannot be that the act passed was intended \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 412]\n\u00a0\n to limit the right to an allotment to those actually residing on the reservation, to the exclusion of a majority of the members of the different bands or tribes. The fact of such nonresidence is presumed to have been known by Congress, and the act should be construed with reference to that knowledge.\n The purpose of the treaty and of the act evidently was to induce the Indians and encourage them so far as possible to break up the tribal relations, and adopt the habits of an agricultural people; and it would seem that those persons who were Indians and members of one or the other bands or tribes of Indians mentioned in the treaty and in the act and recognized by the chief of the tribe should have the right to an allotment, especially if recognized by the Land L. partment as entitled thereto.\n The purpose of the act would fall very far short of accomplishment were the allotments confined exclusively to those actually residing within the limits of the reservation, while those who were absent therefrom, but still within the old limits of the land, and were members of the band, recognized as such, should be held not entitled to the allotments under the act, simply because of residence outside of the described limits of the reservation.\n The appellant further contends that the weight of the evidence shows the appellee is not a member of the Walla Walla tribe of Indians. We are not disposed to review that question of fact, which has been determined by the special examiner, and adopted by the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals. There is evidence upon which the fact as found may be based, and it is not so plainly erroneous as to call upon this court to vary from its usual rule not to review the unanimous finding upon questions of fact of two courts, unless such finding is plainly erroneous.\n Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 42 S. L. ed. 639, 644, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274; Baker v. Cummings, \n169 \nU.S. 189, 198\n, 42 S. L. ed. 711, 716, 18 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 458.\n Another objection is made that the United States is a nec- \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 413]\n\u00a0\n essary party defendant, and, not being before the court, no binding decree can be entered herein.\n The contest here is between two Indians, each claiming the same land under an allotment which was made last to the appellant herein. The United States has no interest in the result. Both parties are Indians claiming under the act of 1885.\n In our opinion, the claim that the United States must be made a party is without foundation. Under the act of 1894 (supra) the circuit courts are given jurisdiction to try and determine any action of this nature, involving the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any law or treaty, 'and the judgment or decree of any such court in favor of any claimant to an allotment of land shall have the same effect, when properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, as if such allotment had been allowed and approved by him. . . . Provided, That the right of appeal shall be allowed to either party as in other cases.' The case at bar was commenced prior to the amendment of the statute of 1894 by the act of February 6, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 760, chap. 217), wherein it is provided that the United States shall be a party defendant, and the case must be decided without regard to the amendment.\n Under this statute there is no provision rendering it necessary, in a private litigation between two claimants for an allotment, to make the United States a party. The statute itself provides that the judgment or decree of the court, upon being properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, is to have the same effect as if the allotment had been allowed and approved by the Secretary. This provision assumes that an action may be maintained without the government being made a party, and provides for the filing of a certificate of the judgment and its effect; and the government thereby, in substance and effect, consents to be bound by the judgment, and to issue a patent in accordance therewith. The 1st section of the act of 1885 (supra) provides that an allotment made by \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 414]\n\u00a0\n or under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior entitles the allottee to a patent for the land allotted to him. And the filing of the certificate of the judgment decreeing an allotment is to have the same effect with the Secretary as if the allotment had been made by him. This is sufficient.\n Upon the facts herein found we are also of opinion that the appellee selected the lands in controversy within the meaning of the statute long prior to the selection made by the appellant, and that she is not concluded by the selection she afterwards made of another tract of land. The act of 1885 provided that the selection of land for allotment should be made by heads of families. The appellee was such, and was so recognized by the Land Department. By  6 of the act the Secretary of the Interior had power to determine all disputes between Indians respecting the allotments. If more than one person claimed the same land, it is, as we think clear, that the dispute should be decided and the allotment made in favor of the one whose priority of selection and residence and whose improvements on the land equitably entitled such person to the land. The government has proceeded upon such principle heretofore (Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 U.S. 330\n, 23 L. ed. 424), and it is a right and eminently just principle. The defendant knew of the prior possession of the appellee, at the time he made his selection, and knew of her improvements upon the land, for they were open and visible, while he had made none, and had obtained possession by direction of the Land Office, only because of the mistake in law which denied the right of allotment to appellee on account of her absence when the census was taken. Defendant, with all this knowledge, selected the land, and never offered to pay a dollar for the improvements, and never has paid anything therefor, nor does he allege in his answer, and there is no proof, that he has since made any improvements on the land, or expended anything thereon. When the Land Department corrected its mistake of law the appellee had the right to insist upon her original selection. Her selection of other land, after the Department had reconsidered her case, \n\n[194 U.S. 401, 415]\n\u00a0\n does not prevent her from claiming this land from defendant. She selected the other land only after advising with the Indian officer, and upon his statement that it would not affect her claim for the land she had previously selected, and from which she had been ordered by the officers of the government. She has never received any patent from the government for this other land, and nothing further need be done by her in order to authorize the government to cancel the allotment for this other land at the time when patent issues for the original selection.\n We find no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE CHRISTENSEN ENGINEERING CO(1904)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus commanding the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit to reinstate and take jurisdiction of a writ of error filed by the petitioner in that court, by which it sought to have reviewed an order of the circuit court for the southern district of New York, adjudging the petitioner guilty of contempt. The facts are, that on August 13, 1900, the Westinghouse Airbrake Company filed in the circuit court its bill of complaint, alleging the ownership of certain letters patent, an infringement by this petitioner, and praying an injunction restraining such infringement, and an accounting of profits and damages. A preliminary injunction was ordered on October 18, 1901. On February 21, 1903, the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt in disobeying that injunction, and ordered to pay a fine of $1,000; one half to the United States and the other half to the complainant. On March 23, 1903, a writ of error to revise this order was allowed by the circuit court, and a full transcript of the proceedings in that court duly certified to the circuit court of appeals. On March 18, 1903, the circuit court entered a decree sustaining the validity of the patent, \n\n[194 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n directing a permanent injunction, and an accounting of profits and damages.

Conkey Co. just decided (\n194 U.S. 324\n, ante, p. 665, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665), of the right of review in contempt cases, precludes the necessity of extended discussion.\n In that case Bessette was not a party to the suit, and the controversy had been settled by a final decree, from which, so far as appeared, no appeal had been taken. He was found guilty of contempt of court, and a fine of $250 imposed, payable to the United States, with costs.\n In this case the Christensen Engineering Company was a party. The contempt was disobedience of preliminary injunction, and the judgment in contempt was intermediate the preliminary injunction and the decree making it permanent. The fine was payable, one half to the United States, and the other half to the complainant.\n The distinction between a proceeding in which a fine is imposed by way of compensation to the party injured by the disobedience, and where it is by way of punishment for an act done in contempt of the power and authority of the court, is pointed out in Bessette's Case, and disclosed by some of the cases referred to in the opinion.\n In New Orleans v. New York Mail S. S. Co. 20 Wall. 387, 22 L. ed. 354, the act in contempt was by one not then a party to the suit. No order was entered against him until the final decree in the case, \n\n[194 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n and then he was punished for the act of disobedience, purely as an act of a criminal nature, and without compensation to the plaintiff in whose favor the injunction was originally ordered. No review under the then- existing law was allowable. In Hayes v. Fischer, \n102 U.S. 121\n, 26 L. ed. 95, the contempt proceeding was remedial and compensatory, and the entire amount of the fine was ordered paid to the plaintiff in reimbursement. It was held that, if the remedial feature was alone to be considered, and the proceeding regarded as a part of the suit, it could not be brought to this court by writ of error, but could only be corrected on appeal from the final decree; if to be regarded as a criminal action, then it was one of which this court had no jurisdiction, either by writ of error or appeal. In Ex parte Debs, 159 U.S. 251, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1039, there was nothing of a remedial or compensatory nature. No fine was imposed, but only a sentence of imprisonment. This court had no jurisdiction of a writ of error in such a case. And see O'Neal v. United States, \n190 U.S. 36\n, 47 L. ed. 945, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 776. In Worden v. Searls, \n121 U.S. 14\n, 30 L. ed. 853, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 814, the proceeding was remedial and compensatory, in that for violations of a preliminary injunction the defendants were ordered to pay the plaintiff $250 'as a fine for said violation,' by one order, and, by another order, to pay a fine of $1,182 to the clerk, to be paid over by him to the plaintiff for 'damages and costs,' the $1,182 being made up of $682 profits made by the infringement, and $500 expenses of plaintiff in the contempt proceedings. These interlocutory orders were reviewed by this court on appeal from the final decree, and as that decree was reversed, the orders were also set aside, this being done 'without prejudice to the power and right of the circuit court to punish the contempt referred to in those orders, by a proper proceeding.' It was also said 'that, though the proceedings were nominally those of contempt, they were really proceedings to award damages to the plaintiff, and to reimburse to him his expenses.'\n These authorities show that when an order imposing a fine for violation of an injunction is substantially one to reimburse \n\n[194 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n the party injured by the disobedience, although called one in a contempt proceeding, it is to be regarded as merely an interlocutory order, and to be reviewed only on appeal from the final decree.\n In the present case, however, the fine payable to the United States was clearly punitive and in vindication of the authority of the court, and, we think, as such, it dominates the proceeding, and fixes its character. Considered in that aspect, the writ of error was justified, and the Circuit Court of Appeals should have taken jurisdiction.\n Petitioner entitled to mandamus. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE U.S.(1904)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n Solicitor General Hoyt and Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus, commanding the judge of the district court of the United States for the northern district of Ohio to direct the entry on the records of that court of final judgment in the cases of United States v. Jock Coe, Bong Meng, and Woo Joe, and that the clerk enter the same; and that the cases be treated as properly appealed from the United States commissioner before whom they had been heard in the first instance, and as having been before the district court for determination. The complaint against Coe was made before a United States commissioner for the northern district of Ohio, charging that Coe, a Chinese person, was within the United States at Cleveland, Ohio, contrary to law, and a warrant was duly issued and executed, whereupon the commissioner found Coe guilty, and ordered him to be deported. \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n Coe appealed 'to the district court of the United States in and for the northern district of Ohio, and the judge of said court,' and the commissioner transmitted a copy of the proceedings before him and the accompanying papers 'into the district court of the United States,' as his certificate stated. The transcript was filed by the clerk of the district court, and was marked as filed among the papers pertaining to the case. Subsequently a hearing was had and  13 of the act of Congress of September 13, 1888,1 was held to be unconstitutional, and Coe was discharged, to which exception was taken. Motion for new trial was made and overruled, and a bill of exceptions was duly settled and signed by the district judge. The United States applied to the clerk to file the bill of exceptions and various papers as part of the record of the district court, and to prepare a certified transcript thereof; but the clerk declined to do this under instruction of the judge, and furthermore stated that so many of the papers as were marked filed 'had been so marked by mistake.' The United States thereupon requested the judge, in writing, to order the clerk to file in the district court all the papers in the proceedings, and to make the necessary entries in regard thereto, and to prepare a certified transcript thereof, in order that a complete record of the same might be preserved, to be used on an appeal taken to this court. The request was refused on the ground that the proceedings on appeal from the commissioner had been had before the judge as judge, and not before the district court.\n Leave having been granted to file the petition, and a rule having been entered thereon, return thereto has been duly made. The return of the judge states that in the proceedings against Coe, which were described in the bill of exceptions, a copy of which was attached to the petition for mandamus as an exhibit, he had denied as judge the order applied for, although he had allowed an appeal of the cause to the Supreme Court of the United States; that he had adopted this course because he was of opinion that  13 gave jurisdiction on appeal to respondent as judge, but did not give \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to the district court to hear such appeal; and that said appeal was heard by respondent as judge, and not in the district court; that the clerk should not be ordered to make the proceedings matter of record in the district court, because there was no provision of law requiring the clerk to record proceedings other than those occurring in the court.\n It seems that the judge allowed a writ of error, but only to his action as judge, and even if it could he held to run to the district court, it would be equally unavailing, in the absence of final judgment in that court and of the filing of the bill of exceptions. As we understand this record, if the appeal from the commissioner under  13 was an appeal to the district court, then it follows that the commissioner's transcript and other papers pertaining to the case should be filed and the judgment be entered in that court, and an appeal will bring the cause before us. In other words, the district court will not have lost jurisdiction because of the view taken by the district judge, and the final order may be entered as the final judgment of the court.\n Section 13 of the act of September 13, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 476, chap. 1015, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1312), provides: 'That any Chinese person, or person of Chinese descent, found unlawfully in the United States, or its territories, may be arrested upon a warrant issued upon a complaint, under oath, filed by any party on behalf of the United States, by any justice, judge, or commissioner of any United States court, returnable before any justice, judge, or commissioner of a United States court, or before any United States court, and when convicted upon a hearing, and found and adjudged to be one not lawfully entitled to be or remain in the United States, such person shall be removed from the United States to the country whence he came. But any such Chinese person convicted before a commissioner of a United States court may, within ten days from such conviction, appeal to the judge of the district court for the district.'\n Many cases may be found in which the words 'court' and 'judge' were held to have been used interchangeably, and in \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n Foote v. Silsby, 1 Blatchf. 542, Fed. Cas. No. 4,917, Mr. Justice Nelson was of opinion that the circuit judge sitting at chambers was the circuit court in the usual and proper sense of the term and within the meaning of the 17th section of the patent act of July 4, 1836 (5 Stat. at L. 117, chap. 357).\n In Porter v. United States, 2 Paine, 313, Fed. Cas. No. 11,290, Judge Betts said: 'It is not an unusual use of language, in the statutes, to put the judge for the court, and to make provisions for him to execute which can only be executed in court.' It was held that a statute authorizing a party 'to prefer a bill of complaint to any district judge of the United States,' referred to the district court, and not to the judge as an individual.\n The construction put upon  13 in practice has been quite general that the appeal to the district judge is in effect an appeal to the district court.\n In 1892 the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit so held, in United States v. Gee Lee, 1 C. C. A. 516, 7 U. S. App. 183, 50 Fed. 271, and that the circuit court of appeals had jurisdiction over the judgment of the district court under  6 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 549, 550]. The circuit court of appeals was of opinion that the words 'the judge of the district court for the district' could and should be held equivalent to the words 'the district court for the district,' and that, while they were not, strictly speaking, convertible terms, they were so in a popular sense; 'and it is safe to assume that Congress, in the use of the former phrase in this section, intended to give the party an appeal to the district court of the district.'\n In United States v. Pin Kwan, 40 C. C. A. 618, 100 Fed. 609, decided February 28, 1900, the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit sustained a writ of error to review the decision of the district court (94 Fed. 824) in which an order of deportation by a United States commissioner had been reversed by the district court. Of course, the circuit court of appeals took jurisdiction on the theory that the statute provided for appeals from the commissioner to the district court. And see United States v. Eam Toy, 56 C. C. A. 685, 120 Fed. 1022. \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n A different view was expressed by the circuit court of the first circuit in the case of Chow Loy, 110 Fed. 952, in September, 1901, a proceeding in habeas corpus, and in the same case on appeal in the succeeding November (50 C. C. A. 279, 112 Fed. 354); and the original ruling was reiterated by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit in Tsoi Yii v. United States, April 4, 1904, not yet reported, in which the case of Chow Loy was considered.\n In United States v. Gue Lim, \n176 U.S. 459\n, 44 L. ed. 544, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 415, decided February 26, 1900, this court entertained jurisdiction of several distinct appeals from the district court for the district of Washington. In the case of Mrs. Gue Lim a warrant had been issued, and her discharge ordered by the district court; but in the other cases the proceedings were had before a United States commissioner, and from his judgment of deportation the cases had been taken to the district court, which reversed his decision. The judgments of the district court were affirmed by this court.\n By the 1st section of the act of April 29, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 176, chap. 641),2  13 of the act of 1888 was, together with some other sections, re-enacted, and we think it not unreasonable to conclude that Congress accepted the view we had indicated, and by its action removed any doubt on the question.\n Shortly after the approval of that act, in Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 U.S. 193\n, 46 L. ed. 1121, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891, we took jurisdiction of an appeal from the judgment of the district court for deportation on an appeal from the United States commissioner to the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York and we observed: 'Something is said in respect of want of jurisdiction in the commissioner because  6 of the act of 1892 [27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1319] provides that Chinese laborers without certificates may be 'taken before a United States judge;' but we concur in the views of the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit in Fong Mey Yuk v. United States, 51 C. C. A. 528, 113 Fed. 898, that the act is satisfied by proceeding before 'a justice, judge, or commissioner.' These are the words used in  12 of the \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n act of 1882 [22 Stat. at L. 58, chap. 126, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1305 ],  12 of the act of 1884 [23 Stat. at L. 115, chap. 220],  13 of the act of 1888, and  3 of the act of 1892; while the 1st section of the act of March 3, 1901 [31 Stat. at L. 1093, chap. 845, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1327], explicitly authorizes the district attorney to designate the commissioner before whom the Chinese person may be brought. The words 'United States judge,' 'judge,' and 'court,' in  6 seem to us to refer to the tribunal authorized to deal with the subject, whether composed of a justice, a judge, or a commissioner. A United States commissioner is a quasi-judicial officer, and in these hearings he acts judicially. Moreover, this case was taken by appeal from the commissioner to the judge of the district court, and his decision was affirmed, so that there was an adjudication by a United States judge in the constitutional sense as well as by the commissioner acting as a judge in the sense of the statute.' . . . 'Section 13, of the act of September 13, 1888, provides that any Chinese person, or person of Chinese descent, found unlawfully in the United States, may be arrested on a warrant issued upon a complaint under oath, 'by any justice, judge, or commissioner of any United States court,' and when convicted, on a hearing, and found and adjudged to be one not lawfully entitled to be or remain in the United States, shall be removed to the country whence he came. 'But any such Chinese person convicted before a commissioner of the United States court, may, within ten days from such conviction, appeal to the judge of the district court for the district.' It seems to have been assumed, during the years following the date of the act, and is conceded by the United States, that although most of its provisions were dependent upon the ratification of the treaty of March 12, 1888, and failed with the failure of ratification, that this section is, in and of itself, independent legislation, and in force as such. Accordingly in this case an appeal was taken from the judgment of deportation rendered by the commissioner to the judge of the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York, and, upon hearing, the district court affirmed that judgment. From the judgment of the \n\n[194 U.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n district court, this appeal was taken under  5 of the act of March 3, 1891, on the ground that the construction of the treaty of 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 1210] was drawn in question.'\n In the cases of Ah How v. United States, \n193 U.S. 65\n, ante, 357, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357, and Tom Hong v. United States, \n193 U.S. 517\n, ante, 517, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517, decided at this term, we disposed of sundry appeals from a district court to which the cases had been brought on appeal from a United States commissioner. Our jurisdiction was greatly challenged by the government, and attention was called to the conflicting decisions of the circuit courts of appeals for the ninth circuit in United States v. Gee Lee, and for the first circuit in Chow Loy v. United States, on the question whether the appeal was to the district judge or to the district court, but we maintained jurisdiction and affirmed the judgments of the district court in some of the cases, and reversed the judgments and discharged the appellants in others. In these cases the district court would not have had jurisdiction if the statute confined appeals from the commissioner to appeals to the judge individually.\n While it must be admitted that the proper construction of  13 is not free from difficulty, we are not willing to change the construction we have heretofore repeatedly recognized as correct, and which we think has been adopted by Congressional legislation. That construction enables uniformity in the administration of the laws on this important subject to be attained by securing uniformity in judicial decision, and operates as a safeguard against injustice.\n We assume that the other two cases are in substance the same as that of Coe.\n The result is that we hold that the relief sought should be granted, but as we do not doubt it will be accorded on the expression of our conclusion, the order will be petitioner entitled to mandamus as prayed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

BRUCE(1904)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n This case came before the court on the following certificate for instructions:\n'The complainant, as the owner of letters patent of the United States for new and useful improvements in stamp canceling and postmarking machines, brought a bill in equity against the defendant, who is postmaster of the United States postoffice at Syracuse, New York, complaining of the use in said postoffice of two machines which infringe the complainant's letters patent, and praying for an injunction against the further use of said machines. The defendant never personally used any stamp canceling and postmarking machines, but the use of said two machines in said postoffice at Syracuse is by some of defendant's subordinates, who are employees of the United States government, such use being in the service of the United States.\n\n'The machines so used were hired by the United States Postoffice Department for a term, which is, as yet, unexpired, \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 602]\n\u00a0\n from the manufacturer and owner of said machines, at an agreed rental, which is payable on the order of the Postoffice Department, by whose orders said machines were placed in the Syracuse postoffice, and were and are now used there.\n\n'And the said United States circuit court of appeals for the second circuit further certifies that, to the end that it may properly decide the questions in such cause, and presented in the assignments of error therein filed, it requires the instructions of the Supreme Court of the United States on the following question, to wit:\n\n'Upon the foregoing facts, has the United States circuit court the power to grant an injunction against the defendant, restraining the use of the machines?'\n\n Messrs.

Richardson and Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for bruce.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Holmes: \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 605]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is governed by Belknap v. Schild, \n161 U.S. 10\n, 40 L. ed. 599, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443. There an injunction was sought against the commandant of the United States navy yard at Mare island, California, and some of his subordinates, to prevent the use of a caisson gate in the dry dock at that place, contrary to the rights of the plaintiff, as patentee. The case was heard on pleas setting up that the caisson gate was made and used by the United States for public purposes, and, as they were construed, that it was the property of the United States. The pleas were held bad as answers to the whole bill, because the bill also sought damages, and the defendants might be personally liable, but it was held that an injunction could not be granted, and the bill was dismissed, without prejudice to an action at law. Vavasseur v. Krupp, L. R. 9 Ch. Div. 351, was cited for the proposition which was made the turning point of the case, that the court could not interfere with an object of property unless it had before it the person entitled to the thing, and this proposition was held to extend to an injunction against the use of the thing as well as to a destruction of it or to a removal of the part which infringed. It was pointed out that the defendants had no personal interest in the continuance of the use, and that, so far as the injunction was concerned, the suit really was against the United States. Of course, if those defendants were enjoined, other persons attempting to use the caisson gate would be, and thus the injunction practically would work a prohibition against its use by the United States.\n Belknap v. Schild differed from United States v. Lee, \n106 U.S. 196\n, 27 L. ed. 171, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, and Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 U.S. 204\n, 42 L. ed. 137, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, and also from \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 47 L. ed. 90, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33, relied on by the appellant, in the fact, among others, that the title of the United States to the caisson gate was admitted, and therefore the United States was a necessary party to a suit which was intended to deprive it of the incident of title,-the right to use the gate. As the United States could not be made a party, the suit failed. In the case at bar the United States is not the owner of the machines, it is true, but it is a lessee in possession, for a term which has not expired. It has a property,-a right in rem,-in the machines, which, though less extensive than absolute ownership, has the same incident of a right to use them while it lasts. This right cannot be interfered with behind its back; and, as it cannot be made a party, this suit, like that of Belknap v. Schild, must fail. The answer to the question certified must be 'No.' Whether or not a renewal of the lease could be enjoined is not before us.\n The question is answered in the negative, and it will be so certified.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n It is to be assumed upon this record that the plaintiff, the International Postal Supply Company, is the owner of letters patent granted by the United States for new and useful improvements in stamp canceling and postmarking machines; and that the defendant, Bruce, against the will of the patentee, and without paying any royalty to him, is using, and, unless enjoined, will continue to use, machines that infringe the plaintiff's letters patent.\n Can the defendant be prevented from thus violating rights of the plaintiff in respect of his patent, the validity of which is not here disputed? In answering this question it is necessary to bring together the observations of this court in some cases heretofore decided. That being done, but little additional need be said. \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n In James v. Campbell, \n104 \nU.S. 356, 357\n, 26 S. L. ed 786, 787, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, said: 'That the government of the United States, when it grants letters patent for a new invention or discovery in the arts, confers upon the patentee an exclusive property in the patented invention which cannot be appropriated or used by the government itself, without just compensation, any more than it can appropriate or use, without compensation, land which has been patented to a private purchaser, we have no doubt. The Constitution gives to Congress power 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries,' which could not be effected if the government had a reserved right to publish such writings or to use such inventions without the consent of the owner. Many inventions relate to subjects which can only be properly used by the government, such as explosive shells, rams, and submarine batteries, to be attached to armed vessels. If it could use such inventions without compensation, the inventors could get no return at all for their discoveries and experiments. It has been the general practice, when inventions have been made which are desirable for government use, either for the government to purchase them from the inventors, and use them as secrets of the proper department; or, if a patent is granted, to pay the patentee a fair compensation for their use. The United States has no such prerogative as that which is claimed by the sovereigns of England, by which it can reserve to itself, either expressly or by implication, a superior dominion and use in that which it grants by letters patent to those who entitle themselves to such grants. The government of the United States, as well as the citizen, is subject to the Constitution; and when it grants a patent the grantee is entitled to it as a matter of right, and does not receive it, as was originally supposed to be the case in England, as a matter of grace and favor.' Observe, that the court said that, without compensation to the patentee, the government could not appropriate or use his invention. \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n These views were reaffirmed by the unanimous judgment of this court in United States v. Palmer, \n128 \nU.S. 262, 272\n, 32 S. L. ed. 442, 445, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 104. And as late as Belknap v. Schild, \n161 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, 40 S. L. ed. 599, 601, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443, 444, after observing that in England the grant of a patent for an invention was considered as simply an exercise of the royal prerogative, and was not to be construed as precluding the Crown from using the invention at its pleasure, the court said: 'But, in this country, letters patent for inventions are not granted in the exercise of prerogative or as a matter of favor, but under art. 1,  8, of the Constitution of the United States, which gives Congress power 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing, for limited terms, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.' The Patent act [16 Stat. at L. 201, chap. 230,  22, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3381] provides that every patent shall contain a grant to the patentee, his heirs, and assigns, for a certain term of years, of 'the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States.' . . . And this court has repeatedly and uniformly declared that the United States have no more right than any private person to use a patented invention without license of the patentee or making compensation to him'-citing United States v. Burns, 12 Wall. 246, 252, 20 L. ed. 388, 389; Cammeyer v. Newton, \n94 \nU.S. 225, 235\n, 24 S. L. ed. 72, 76; James v. Campbell, \n104 \nU.S. 356, 358\n, 26 S. L. ed. 786, 787; Hollister v.

Rep. 104.\n In the previous case of United States v. Lee, \n106 U.S. 196\n, 27 L. ed. 171, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, which was a suit to recove certain lands to which the plaintiffs claimed title, but which were in the possession of the defendants (officers of the Army), who asserted title in the United States, it was contended that the suit was, in legal effect, one against the United States, and therefore not maintainable. But the contrary was adjudged in that case. The court, upon an extended review of the authorities, held that the suit was not to be deemed one against the government, within the recognized rule that the United States cannot be sued without its consent, and that it was competent for the \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n courts to protect the rights of the plaintiffs against the wrong acts of the defendants, although they were officers of the government, and acting by its authority. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court, said: 'This right being clearly established, we are told that the court can proceed no further, because it appears that certain military officers, acting under the orders of the President, have seized this estate, and converted one part of it into a military fort and another into a cemetery. It is not pretended, as the case now stands, that the President had any lawful authority to do this, or that the legislative body could give him any such authority except upon payment of just compensation. The defense stands here solely upon the absolute immunity from judicial inquiry of every one who asserts authority from the executive branch of the government, however clear it may be made that the executive passed no such power. Not only no such power is given, but it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the legislative, to deprive any one of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compensation. These provisions for the security of the rights of the citizen stand in the Constitution in the same connection, and upon the same ground, as they regard his liberty and his property. It cannot be denied that both were intended to be enforced by the judiciary as one of the departments of the government established by that Constitution. . . . No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who, by accepting office, participates in its functions, is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives. Courts of justice are established not only to decide upon the controverted rights of the citizens as against \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 610]\n\u00a0\n each other, but also upon rights in controversy between them and the government; and the docket of this court is crowded with controversies of the latter class. Shall it be said, in the face of all this, and of the acknowledged right of the judiciary to decide in proper cases, statutes which have been passed by both branches of Congress, and approved by the President, to be unconstitutional, that the courts cannot give a remedy when the citizen has been deprived of his property by force, his estate seized, and converted to the use of the government without lawful authority, without process of law, and without compensation, because the President has ordered it, and his officers are in possession? If such be the law of this country, it sanctions a tyranny which has no existence in the monarchies of Europe, nor in any other government which has a just claim to well-regulated liberty and the protection of personal rights.'\n In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 35 S. L. ed. 363, 365, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699, 701, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Lamar, after referring to the class of suits in which the defendants, claiming to act as officers of the state, and under color of an unconstitutional statute, commit acts of wrong and injury to the rights and property of the plaintiff, said: 'Such suit, whether brought to recover money or property in the hands of such defendants, unlawfully taken by them in behalf of the state, or for compensation in damages, or, in a proper case, where the remedy at law is inadequate, for an injunction to prevent such wrong and injury, or for a mandamus, in a like case, to enforce upon the defendant the performance of a plain, legal duty, purely ministerial,-is not, within the meaning of the 11th Amendment, an action against the state.' This principle was reaffirmed by the court, speaking by the present Chief Justice, in Re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 169\n, 37 S. L. ed. 689, 691, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 785, and again in Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 58, 68\n, 41 S. L. ed. 632, 633, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265.\n In Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 U.S. 204\n, 42 L. ed. 137, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, by a unanimous judgment, the court held that a suit against an individual, to recover possession of certain real estate, was not one against \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 611]\n\u00a0\n a state, forbidden by the 11th Amendment, although defendant was in possession as an officer of the state, not asserting any interest for himself in the property. It said: 'If a suit against officers of a state, to enjoin them from enforcing an unconstitutional statute, whereby the plaintiff's property will be injured, or to recover damages for taking, under a void statute, the property of the citizen, be not one against the state, it is impossible to see how a suit against the same individuals to recover the possession of property belonging to the plaintiff and illegally withheld by the defendants, can be deemed a suit against the state. Any other view leads to this result: That if a state, by its officers, acting under a void statute, should seize for public use the property of a citizen, without making or securing just compensation for him, and thus violate the constitutional provision declaring that no state shall deprive any person of property without due process of law (Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 236\n, 241 S., 41 L. ed. 979, 984, 986, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581), the citizen is remediless so long as the state, by its agents, chooses to hold his property; for, according to the contention of the defendants, if such agents are sued as individuals, wrongfully in possession, they can bring about the dismissal of the suit by simply informing the court of the official character in which they hold the property thus illegally appropriated.'\n I cannot agree that the present decision is in harmony with the principles announced in the above cases. The United States is not here sued, although, as in United States v. Lee, it may be incidentally affected by the result. No decree is asked against it. The suit is against Dwight H. Bruce, who is proceeding in violation of the plaintiff's right of property, and denies the power of any court to interfere with him, solely upon the ground that what he is doing is under the order and sanction of the Postoffice Department. He is, so to speak, in the possession of, and wrongfully using, the plaintiff's patented invention, and denies the right of any court, by its mandatory order, to prevent him from continuing in his lawless \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 612]\n\u00a0\n invasion of a right granted by the Constitution and laws of the United States. But, as shown by the cases above cited, not even the United States, much less the head of a department, has a right to use the patent of the plaintiff without its license and without compensation. Although the Constitution and statutes of the United States give to the plaintiff the right to the exclusive use of the invention, nevertheless, according to the present decision, that use may be rendered utterly valueless by the device of an order from the head of an executive department to a subordinate, to proceed in disregard of the rights of the patentee. Thus every patented right to an invention which can be profitably or conveniently used in the business of the government may be destroyed by the arbitrary action of the head of a department, and the patentee deprived of any compensation whatever for his invention, except such as Congress may, in its discretion, choose to allow.\n If Congress, by statute, and in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, had chosen to take the plaintiff's patent right for public use, at the same time opening the way, by some appropriate proceeding, through which the patentee could secure compensation from the government for his property so taken, different considerations would arise. But no such action has been taken by Congress. The case before us is one in which it is held that the court cannot, by any direct process against the defendant, stop him from doing that which, confessedly, he has no legal right to do,- namely, to use an invention against the will of the patentee. It was supposed that this court announced an incontrovertible proposition when, in United States v. Lee, it said that 'no man in this country is so high that he is above the law,' and that 'all the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.' But it seems that some officers are above the law, and may trample upon the rights of private property; heads of departments, who may, upon their own motion, seize the property of a patentee, and use it in the public business, and then close the doors of the courts \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 613]\n\u00a0\n with such effect that a subordinate officer, acting under departmental orders, may not be stopped in his wrongful violation of the rights of the patentee. Such arbitrary destruction of the property rights of the citizen might be expected to occur under a despotic government, but it ought not to be tolerated under a government whose fundamental law forbids all deprivation of property without due process of law, or the taking of private property for public use without compensation. Both the Constitution and the acts of Congress recognize the patentee's right to the exclusive use of his invention. But, for every practical purpose, the present decision not only places it in the power of an executive department to destroy the rights of the patentee, but recognizes the helplessness of the judiciary in the presence of such a wrong.\n Suppose Congress, under its power to regulate commerce, should enact a statute regulating rates for freight and passengers on interstate carriers, and that such statute, by reason of some provisions in it, was unconstitutional, or incapable of execution without destroying the legal rights of such carriers. Could it be doubted that the courts might, at the instance of an interstate carrier directly affected by the act, enjoin the public officers charged with the execution of the act from enforcing its provisions? Would their hands be stayed by the suggestion that, as the United States, in its corporate capacity, could not be made a party defendant of record, no relief could be granted against the persons who sought, under the cover of official station, to enforce an unconstitutional statute, destructive of private rights?\n Or, suppose Congress should, by statute, expressly direct the Postmaster General to use a particular patented invention, paying nothing for such use, and at the same time withhold from the courts jurisdiction of any suit against the government by the patentee to obtain compensation for his property, so taken for public use. Ought it to be doubted that such an act would be declared unconstitutional and void, and that the courts would, at the suit of the patentee, although \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 614]\n\u00a0\n the government was not and could not be made a party defendant of record, prevent the person holding the office of Postmaster General from proceeding under the act? Such a suit would not be regarded as a suit against the United States in its governmental capacity, any more than a suit by a railroad company against the official representatives of a state, charged with the execution of an unconstitutional statute fixing confiscatory rates for freights, would be deemed a suit against a state within the meaning of the 11th Amendment. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 42 L. ed. 819, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418, and authorities cited.\n Let me give another illustration. Suppose Congress should, by statute, in a time of peace, direct the Secretary of War to take possession of the private residence of a citizen and use it for a quartermaster's office, and at the same time exclude from the jurisdiction of any court a suit against the United States to recover compensation for the property so taken for public use. Would the court refuse to stay the hands of the Secretary of War in executing the provisions of such a statute, simply because the United States could not be made a party of record to the suit? Surely not.\n The court regards Belknap v. Schild as decisive of this case. I cannot assent to that view. That case was exceptional in its facts, and its doctrines ought not to be extended so as to embrace the present one. If there are expressions in the opinion in that case which seem to sustain the present decision, they should be withdrawn, or so modified as not to impair the force of previous decisions. The relief asked in that case was not only an injunction against the defendants from using the caisson gate which had been constructed, as was alleged, in violation of the plaintiff's rights as patentee for an improvement in caisson gates, but an order for the destruction or delivery to plaintiff of the particular gate in question, which had been built for the United States, according to plans furnished by its officers, and had been placed in such position that it had become a part, physically, of the docks at the government navy yard. The destruction or displacement \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 615]\n\u00a0\n of the gate, by order of the court, would have seriously disturbed the general business of the entire Navy Yard. In the present case the facts are altogether different. To enjoin the present defendant from using the plaintiff's invention may produce some inconvenience, for a time, at his particular office, but it will only make it necessary for the government to be honest, and either pay the plaintiff for the right to use its invention, or direct that some mode of stamp canceling be employed other than that involved in the plaintiff's patent. A government employer cannot justify the illegal use of a patentee's invention upon the ground that such use will subserve his convenience, or enable him more efficiently to serve the public. The effective relief sought here is not the physical destruction of the machines leased by the government, but an injunction to prevent the defendant Bruce from using the plaintiff's invention, embodied in whatever machine, without his license, and without compensation to him. No relief is asked against any other person than the defendant. It is admitted that the United States cannot, any more than a private individual, use a patented invention without the license of the patentee. It is admitted that the head of an executive department cannot legally authorize a postmaster to use such invention against the will of the patentee. It is admitted that no postmaster can legally justify his invasion of the patentee's right by any order given by the Postmaster General which was made or issued in derogation of the rights of the patentee. And yet it is now adjudged that, although a postmaster may be confessedly proceeding in direct violation of the legal rights of the patentee, the court cannot, by any direct process, stop him in his destruction of the patentee's right of property. Under the present decision, the Postoffice Department not only may use, without compensation, the particular postmarking machines in question here, but it can lease others, and continue its violation of the patentee's rights at its discretion, thereby making the exclusive use granted by the patent of no value whatever. \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 616]\n\u00a0\n It may be said that the patentee has a remedy in an action for damages against the infringer. But clearly such a remedy is not at all adequate or efficacious. The slightest reflection will show this. The only effectual remedy is an injunction against him. In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 35 S. L. ed. 363, 365, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699, and in Re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 169\n, 37 S. L. ed. 689, 691, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 785, it was held that in suits against public officers on account of wrongful acts done under color of an unconstitutional statute, where the remedy at law was inadequate, an injunction to prevent such wrong and injury was proper. The books are full of cases in support of that principle. I submit that the immunity of the United States from direct suit is an all-sufficient reason why the court shall lay its hands upon the defendant, who happens to be a local postmaster, and prevent him, by injunction, from disregarding the admittedly legal rights of the plaintiff. No other remedy is adequate. If that relief cannot be granted, then the rights of all patentees whose inventions can be used in the prosecution of the business of the government are subject to be destroyed by the arbitrary action of heads of departments and their subordinate officers.\n I am of opinion that every officer of the government, however high his position, may be prevented by injunction, operating directly upon him, from illegally injuring or destroying the property rights of the citizen; and this relief should more readily be given when the government itself cannot be made a party of record.\n The courts may, by mandamus, compel a public officer to perform a plain, ministerial duty prescribed by law; and that may be done, although the government itself cannot be made a party of record. Can it be possible that the court is without authority to enjoin the same officer from doing a direct, affirmative wrong to the property rights of the citizen, upon the ground that the government whom he represents, and in whose interest he is acting, is not and cannot be made a party of record? The present decision-erroneously, I take leave to say-answers this question favorably to the defendant. \n\n[194 U.S. 601, 617]\n\u00a0\n But that answer cannot, I submit, be made consistently with the declaration which this court has often repeated, that no officer of the law, however high his position, can set that law at defiance with impunity; that the government, as well as the citizen, is subject to the Constitution, and therefore cannot legally appropriate or use a patented invention without just compensation any more than it can appropriate or use, without compensation, land that it had patented to a private purchaser. Instead of a patentee having the exclusive use or control of his invention,-which is the mandate of both the Constitution and the statute,-heads of department, it seems, are not bound to respect the rights of inventors, but can enjoy the exclusive privilege of appropriating to the use of the government, without compensation to the patentee, any patented invention that may be beneficial in the prosecution of the public business. In my judgment it is not possible to conceive of any case, arising under our system of constitutional government, in which the courts may not, in some effective mode, and properly, protect the rights of the citizen against illegal aggression, and to that end, if need be, stay the hands of the aggressor, even if he be a public officer, who acts in the interest, or by the direction, of the government.\n Mr. Justic Peckham concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v. BAIRD(1904)\nNo. 409\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n This is an appeal from an order made in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York in the matter of the petition of the Interstate Commerce Commission for orders requiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of certain books, papers, and documents. The petition recites that the Attorney General of the United States, at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission, instructed the United States district attorney for the southern district of New York to present the petition and institute proper proceedings for the enforcement of the provisions of the acts to regulate interstate commerce, as amended, and to invoke the aid of the court in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents, pursuant to the provisions of said acts. The case \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n grows out of a complaint of William Randolph Hearst, filed on November 2, 1902, with the Interstate Commerce Commission, against the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, Delaware, Lackawanna, & Western Railroad, central Railroad Company of New Jersey, New York, Susquehanna, & Western Railroad Company, Erie Railroad Company, New York, Ontario, & Western Railway Company, Delaware & Hudson Company, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company.\n In the complaint it was charged: That the defendants are common carriers, engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight between points in different states of the United States, and are particularly engaged in the transportation of anthracite and bituminous coal mined in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia, and shipped as interstate traffic over said lines, and are carriers subject to the provision of the act of February 4, 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154], to regulate commerce, and the acts amendatory thereto; that the rates charged and exacted by the defendants for the transportation of anthracite coal in carloads from points in the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania to New York city and New York harbor points and internal points of destination in the state of New York, to Boston and other points in the New England states, to Baltimore and other points in the state of Maryland, and to Washington, in the District of Columbia, are unreasonable and unjust, and subject consumers and producers of such coal who are not common carriers or corporations owned and controlled by common carriers, to undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage in favor of, and to the undue and unreasonable preference and advantage of, said defendants and companies under their control, in violation of  1 and 3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce; that the rates charged and exacted by the defendants for the transportation of anthracite coal are relatively unreasonable and unjust, and unjustly discriminating against the interests of dealers and consumers of that com- \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n modity as compared with the rates contemporaneously charged by said defendants for transportation of bituminous coal for much longer distances and to the points of destination above mentioned, and also as compare with the defendants' rates and charges on other carload freight generally, all of which is a violation of  1, 2, and 3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce; that the defendant companies-Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, Delaware, Lackawanna, & Western Railroad Company, New York, Susquehanna, & Western Railroad Company, and the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company-are, in the absence of agreement, natural competitors in the business of transporting anthracite coal from the coal fields of Pennsylvania to tidewater at New York, two of said defendants-the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey-being substantially parallel lines; that in 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, and 1901 the six defendants last named, by an agreement and combination with one another, pooled, and have, during the year 1902, pooled, freights and freight traffic in anthracite coal, so as to divide the same between their different lines in agreed proportions, in violation of  5 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. The prayer of the petition was that the defendants be required to make answer to the charges, and, after hearing, for an order or orders commanding the said defendants, and each of them, wholly to cease and desist from each and every of the alleged violations of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and for such further order or orders and action by the Commission as its duty under the act and the cause of petitioner and others similarly situated may require. Answers were filed by the railroad companies, taking issue with the allegations of the petition and denying violation of the law. In the course of the hearing certain witnesses refused to produce contracts and answer questions when required so to do by order of the Commission, which refusal gave rise to the petition to the circuit court. The character of the testimony required by the order of the Commission is sufficiently \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n set forth in the opinion hereinafter given. To the petition answers were filed too legthy to abstract, and in substance setting forth the right of the defendants to refuse the production of the papers and documents and to decline to answer the questions because the same did not relate to any subject which the Commission had the right to investigate, and the contracts relate to the private business of persons not parties to the proceedings before the Commission; that the witnesses are protected in their right to refuse to produce the contracts or answer the questions by the 4th, 5th, and 10th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; that the contracts were not relevant to the subject-matter of investigation before the Commission. The circuit court placed its decision on the latter ground, and dismissed the petition of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\nMessrs. William A. Day and John G. Carlisle for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Johnson, Walter W. Ross, Adelbert Moot, George F. Brownell, Francis I. Gowen, F. H. Janvier, J. D. Campbell, Robert Thorne, and Robert W. Deforest for appellees.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 25, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n A motion is made to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that no direct appeal lies to this court from the order of the circuit court. The act of February 19, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 849, chap. 708; U. S. Comp. Stat. \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 36]\n\u00a0\n 1901, Sup. of 1903, p. 365], to further regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states,  3, closing paragraph, enacts, 'Provided. That the provisions of an act entitled [32 Stat. at L. 823, chap. 544]1 'An Act to Expedite the Hearing and Determination of Suits in Equity Pending or Hereafter Brought Under the Act of July Second, Eighteen Hundred and Ninety, Entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies,' [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200] 'An Act to Regulate Commerce,' Approved February Fourth, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-seven, [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154] or Any Other Acts having a Like Purpose That May Be Hereafter Enacted, Approved February Eleventh, Nineteen Hundred and Three, shall apply to any case prosecuted under the direction of the Attorney General in the name of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n The 2d section of the act of February 11, 1903 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, Sup. for 1903, p. 376), provides, 'That in every suit in equity pending or hereafter brought in any circuit court of the United States under any of said acts [having reference to the anti-trust act of 1890 and the Act to Regulate Commerce mentioned in the preceding section] wherein the United States is complainant, including cases submitted but not yet decided, an appeal from the final decree of the circuit court will lie only to the Supreme Court, and must be taken within sixty days from the entry thereof.'\n In support of the motion to dismiss it is argued that the language of the proviso of  3, above quoted, 'shall apply to any case prosecuted under the direction of the Attorney General in the name of the Interstate Commerce Commission,' must be read in connection with preceding paragraphs of the section, which provide for bringing actions by direction of the Attorney General in the circuit courts of the United States, and do not include proceedings of the character of the present action to compel the production of books and papers and the giving of testimony by witnesses called before the Commission.\n It is true that the office of a proviso, strictly considered, is to make exception from the enacting clause, to restrain generality and to prevent misinterpretation. Minis v. United \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 37]\n\u00a0\n States, 15 Pet. 423; 10 L. ed. 791; Austin v. United States, \n155 U.S. 417\n- 431; 39 L. ed. 206-211, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167; White v. United States, \n191 U.S. 545\n, 551, ante, p. 171, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171. It is apparent that this proviso was not inserted in any restrictive sense or to make clear that which might be doubtful from the general language used. It was inserted for the purpose of enlarging the operation of the statute so as to include a class of cases not otherwise within the operation of the section. It may be admitted that this use of a proviso is not in accord with the technical meaning of the term or the office of such part of a statute when properly used. But it is, nevertheless, a frequent use of the proviso in Federal legislation to introduce, as in the present case, new matter extending rather than limiting or explaining that which has gone before.\n In Chesapeake & P. Teleph. Co. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238, 242\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1144, 1146, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 881, 883, the subject was under consideration, and Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion, while recognizing the restrictive office of a proviso as stated by Mr. Justice Story in Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445, 10 L. ed. 791, 799, added: 'While this is the general effect of a proviso, yet in practice it is not always so limited. As said in Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 32 S. L. ed. 377, 380, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47. The general purpose of a proviso, as is well known, is to except the clause covered by it from the general provisions of a statute, or from some provisions of it, or to qualify the operation of the statute in some particular. But it is often used in other senses. It is a common practice in legislative proceedings, on the consideration of bills, for parties desirous of securing amendments to them to precede their proposed amendments with the term 'provided,' so as to declare that, nothwithstanding existing provisions, the one thus expressed is to prevail, thus having no greater signification than would be attached to the conjunction 'but' or 'and' in the same place, and simply serving to separate or distinguish the different paragraphs or sentences.'\n The provision in the statute under consideration being intended to enlarge rather than limit the application of previous terms should not receive so narrow a construction as to defeat \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 38]\n\u00a0\n its purpose. It extends the terms of the act of February 11, 1903, to 'any case' brought under the direction of the Attorney General in the name of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The 2d section of the act of February 11 has reference, it is true, to a suit in equity under certain acts wherein the United States is complainant, and the argument is that the extension of the terms of this act in the act of February 19 is only to suits in equity. But for some reason Congress, in the act under consideration, saw fit not to limit the terms of the extension to suits or proceedings provided for in  3 of the act of February 19, or to suits in equity, but broadly extended the rights and privileges of the act of February 11 to 'cases' of the character designated. We cannot assume that this use of the broader term was without purpose. Before the passage of this act this court had held that a petition filed under  12 of the Interstate Commerce Act2 against a witness duly summoned to testify before the Commission, to compel him to testify or to produce books, documents, and papers relating to the matter in controversy, makes a case or controversy to which the judicial power of the United States extends. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, 38 L. ed. 1047, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 545, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1125. The object of construction, as has been often said by the courts and writers of authority, is to ascertain the legislative intent, and, if possible, to effectuate the purposes of the lawmakers. We cannot read these statutes without perceiving the manifest purpose of Congress to facilitate the disposition of cases brought under the direction of the Attorney General to enforce the provision of the anti-trust and interstate commerce statutes. The present proceeding is not merely advisory to the Commission, but, as was said in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, 38 L. ed. 1047, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 545, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1125, a judgment rendered will be a final and indisputable basis of action as between the Commission and the defendant, and furnish a precedent for similar cases. While it has for its object the obtaining of testimony in aid of proceedings before the Commission, it is evident that important questions may be in- \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 39]\n\u00a0\n volved touching the power of the Commission and the constitutional rights and privileges of citizens. Congress deemed it imperative that such cases, affecting the commerce of the country as well as personal rights, should be promptly determined in a court of last resort.\n If the appeal in the first instance was to the court of appeals the judgment of that court would not be final under the act of March 3, 1891 [ 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547], and in such case this court would still be required to consider the cases on final appeal. We think it was the purpose of the act to eliminate an appeal to the circuit court of appeals, and to permit the litigation to be shortened by a direct appeal to this court.\n We pass, now, to the merits of the controversy. The record in this case is voluminous, and much of the discussion before the Commission is printed. We shall endeavor to classify and consider the questions made so as to indicate our holdings with a view to a proper judgment in the ease.\n It is urged that the complainant before the Commission did not show any real interest in the case brought and that the proceeding should, for that reason, have been dismissed. It is provided in the Act to Regulate Commerce,  13, that 'any person, firm, corporation,' etc., complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, in contravention of the provisions thereof, may apply to said Commission by petition, etc. And certain procedure is provided for-and (said Commission) 'may institute any inquiry on its own motion in the same manner and to the same effect as though complaint had been made,' and the section concludes: 'No complaint shall at any time be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.' In face of this mandatory requirement that the complaint shall not be dismissed because of the want of direct damage to the complainant, no alternative is left the Commission but to investigate the complaint, if it presents matter within the purview of the act and the powers granted to the Commission. \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 40]\n\u00a0\n Power is conferred upon the Commission, under  12 of the act as amended March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 858, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3162), and February 10, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 743, chap. 128, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3162), to inquire into the management of the business of all common carriers subject to the provisions of the act, and to keep itself informed as to the manner and method in which the same is conducted, with the right to obtain from such common carriers full and complete information necessary to enable the Commission to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created.\n In making the orders which were the basis of the application to the circuit court, and in the petition filed therein, it is set forth that the Commission, at the time when the witnesses refused to produce the contracts required was engaged 'in the discharge of its duty to execute and enforce the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and in the exercise of its authority to inquire into the business of common carriers subject to the provisions of the act, and to keep itself informed as to the manner and method in which said business is conducted, and to obtain from said common carriers full and complete information necessary to enable it to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created; and your petitioner is of the opinion that said contracts are not only material and relevant to the issues on trial in said proceeding, but that the production thereof as required by it, as aforesaid, is necessary to enable your petitioner to discharge its duty and execute and enforce said provisions of said Act to Regulate Commerce and to inform your petitioner as to the manner and method in which the business of said common carriers is conducted, and to enable your petitioner to obtain the full and complete information necessary to enable your petitioner to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created.'\n But in the present case, whatever may be the right of the Commission to carry on an investigation under the general powers conferred in  12, this proceeding was under the \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 41]\n\u00a0\n complaint filed, and we will examine the testimony offered with a view to its competency under the allegations made by the complainant.\n Coming now to the specific items of testimony which the circuit court, in dismissing the petition, considered irrelevant to the controversy, we will first consider the socalled coal purchase contracts.\n It is unnecessary for the present purpose to go into detail as to the provisions of these contracts. In the main they were made with coal companies owned principally by the railroad companies and contain the same general provisions. Among others, the purchase price of anthracite coal above a certain size is to be 65 per cent of the average price, computed monthly, at certain tide points, of coal of the same quality and size. All the coal mined by the contracting operators is sold, shipments to be made as called for by the purchasers.\n While the contracts were produced for inspection, the witnesses refused to permit them to be given in evidence. The circuit court held them to be irrelevant upon the ground that they related solely to an intrastate transaction,-the sale of the coal in Pennsylvania,-and had nothing to do with interstate commerce. It appears that the railroad companies proceeded against in the complaint are engaged in carrying coal from the anthracite coal regions to tidewater. The contracts are between certain coal companies and independent operators engaged in mining coal in that region. The testimony shows that the coal companies making the contracts are principally owned by the railroad companies. For what purpose this separate ownership is maintained it is not necessary now to inquire. The fact of such ownership is undisputed, and for the present purpose it may be conceded that the ownership is lawful under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania.\n The railroads are all engaged in interstate commerce, and into their affairs and methods of doing business the Commission might be, and is, lawfully authorized by the commerce act to make investigation. In speaking of this power as under- \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 42]\n\u00a0\n taken to be vested in the Commission, this court said in the Brimson Case, \n154 U.S. 472\n, 38 L. ed. 1055, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 554, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1131: 'It was not disputed at the bar, nor indeed can it be successfully denied, that the prohibition of unjust charges, discriminations, or preferences by carriers engaged in interstate commerce, in respect to property or persons transported from one state to another, is a proper regulation of interstate commerce, or that the object that Congress has in view by the act in question may be legitimately accomplished by it under the power to regulate commerce among the several states. In every substantial sense such prohibition is a rule by which interstate commerce must be governed, and is plainly adapted to the object to be accomplished. The same observation may be made in respect to those provisions empowering the Commission to inquire into the management of the business of carriers subject to the provisions of the act, and to investigate the whole subject of interstate commerce as conducted by such carriers, and in that way to obtain full and accurate information of all matters involved in the enforcement of the act of Congress. It was clearly competent for Congress, to that end, to invest the Commission with authority to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any matter legally committed to that body for investigation.'\n In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. \n167 \nU.S. 479, 506\n, 42 S. L. ed. 243, 255, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896, 903, this court held that the Commission had no power to fix rates. In the course of the opinion it was said: 'It [the Commission] is charged with the general duty of inquiring as to the management of the business of railroad companies, and to keep itself informed as to the manner in which the same is conducted, and has the right to compel complete and full information as to the manner in which such carriers are transacting their business.'\n The testimony shows that much of the coal purchased under these contracts is sold in Pennsylvania, but a considerable portion is carried to tide water. The coal is purchased by \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 43]\n\u00a0\n companies owned by the railroads, for which payment is made on the basis of 65 per cent of the general average price received at tidewater by the sale of sizes above pea coal, leaving 35 per cent for the purchaser, from which he must pay transportation charges and cost of sale. Here is a railroad company engaged at once in the purchase of coal through a company which it practically owns and the transportation of the same coal through different states to the seaboard. Why may not the Interstate Commerce Commission, under the powers conferred, and under this complaint, inquire into the manner in which this business is done? It has the right to know how interstate traffic is conducted, the relations between the carrier and its shippers, and the rates charged and collected. We see no reason why contracts of this character, which have direct relation to a large amount of its carrying trade, can be withheld from examination as evidence by the Commission. These contracts were made by the officials of the railroad companies, who were also officials of the coal companies, after protracted conferences. Upon the ground that they pertained to the manner of conducting a material part of the business of these interstate carriers, which was under investigation, we think the Commission had a right to demand their production. And, further, it was claimed that, while these contracts were in form purchases of coal, their real purpose was to fix a rate for transportation to the carriers, who were in fact paid for the only interest they had in the coal,-the right to receive pay for its transportation,-by the percentage retained from the selling price after deducting charges and expenses in marketing the coal.\n It is to be remembered in this connection that we are not dealing with the ultimate fact of controversy, or deciding which of the contending claims will be finally established. This is a question of relevancy of proof before a body not authorized to make a final judgment, but to investigate and make orders which may or may not be finally embodied in judgments or decrees of the court. If the railroad companies in fact re- \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 44]\n\u00a0\n ceived their compensation for carriage from the sum retained by the coal companies as was claimed, then, whether they realized more or less than their published rates depended upon the price of coal. Taking the prices at times as shown in the statements filed with the Commission, it is apparent that the 35 per cent was less than published rates, and if that was the sum received for transportation, would work a discrimination against coal companies not having such contracts, and paying the full rate. On the other hand, if the coal companies paid the full rate, and failed to realize as much from the percentage of the selling price retained, they would be losing money, and as they were owned by the railroad companies the loss would be ultimately theirs, and not the coal companies. It may be that the Commission or the courts will ultimately find that these contracts do not fix the compensation received by the carriers, and that, as claimed, the full rate is paid by these purchasing companies, and if there is a loss on these contracts it is made up in other business; but, as we have said, the question concerns the relevancy of proof, and not whether it finally establishes the issue made, one way or the other. Relevancy does not depend upon the conclusiveness of the testimony offered, but upon its legitimate tendency to establish a controverted fact. Relevancy is that 'quality of evidence which renders it properly applicable in determining the truth or falsity of the matter in issue between the parties to a suit.' 1 Bouvier Law Dict. Rawle's Revision, 866.\n The inquiry of a board of the character of the Interstate Commerce Commission should not be too narrowly constrained by technical rules as to the admissibility of proof. Its function is largely one of investigation, and it should not be hampered in making inquiry pertaining to interstate commerce by those narrow rules which prevail in trials at common law, where a strict correspondence is required between allegation and proof.\n It is contended in the answers filed in the circuit court that to require the production of these contracts would be to compel \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 45]\n\u00a0\n the witnesses to furnish evidence against themselves which might result in forfeiture of estate, in violation of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution; would subject the parties to unreasonable searches and seizure of their papers, contrary to the 4th Amendment, and would require them to produce papers pertaining wholly to intrastate affairs, in violation of the reserved rights of the people of the states, and beyond the power of the Commission, whose duties are limited to investigations pertaining to interstate commerce.\n At the hearing the constitutional objections do not seem to have been relied upon; those argued pertained to the relevancy of the proof and the rights of persons not before the court to be protected from the publication of their private contracts. As to the constitutional objection based upon the 5th Amendment, the act as amended February 11, 1893 [27 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 83, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3173], expressly extends immunity from prosecution or forfeiture of estate because of testimony given in pursuance of the requirements of the law. The full consideration of the subject and the decision of this court in Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 40 L. ed. 819, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 369, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644, renders further consideration of this objection unnecessary.\n The origin and interpretation of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution, securing immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures, was fully discussed by Mr. Justice Bradley in the leading case of Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 26 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. In that opinion the learned Justice points out the analogy between the 4th and 5th Amendments, and the object of both to protect a citizen from compulsory testimony against himself which may result in his punishment or the forfeiture of his estate, or the seizure of his papers by force, or their compulsory production by process for the like purpose. In the course of the opinion it is said: 'Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the 4th and \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 46]\n\u00a0\n 5th Amendments run almost into each other.' And see Adams v. New York ( decided at this term), 193 U. S. ante, p. 372, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372.\n As we have seen, the statute protects the witness from such use of the testimony given as will result in his punishment for crime or the forfeiture of his estate. Testimony given under such circumstances presents scarcely a suggestion of an unreasonable search or seizure. Indeed, the parties seem to have made little objection to the inspection of the papers, the contest was over their relevancy as testimony. Nor can we see force in the suggestion that these contracts were made with persons not parties to the proceeding. Undoubtedly the courts should protect nonlitigants from unnecessary exposure of their business affairs and papers. But it certainly can be no valid objection to the admission of testimony, otherwise relevant and competent, that a third person is interested in it.\n As to the so-called Temple Iron Company contracts: It appears that in 1889 certain operators in the anthracite coal region organized a competing railroad, with a view to carrying their product from the coal regions to market at tidewater. It became evident that this company was likely to succeed, and to construct a competing railroad from the coal fields to the sea. With a view to acquiring its property, five of the leading railroad carriers purchased the collieries whose proprietors were developing the new scheme. To pay for these the charter of the Temple Iron Company was purchased and its capital stock increased. The company issued a large amount of stock and bonds, and the contracting railroad companies agreed among themselves and with the Guaranty Trustee Company of New York, as trustee, to guarantee a 6 per cent dividend upon the Temple Iron Company stock and the payment of principal and interest of the bonds. This ended the building of an independent line, and the transportation of coal from the collieries is distributed among the carriers interested.\n It is argued that these contracts, if given in evidence, will tend to show a pooling of freights, in violation of the 5th \n\n[194 U.S. 25, 47]\n\u00a0\n section of the commerce act. While this testimony may not establish such an arrangement as is suggested, it has, in our opinion, a legitimate bearing upon the question. There is a division of freight among several railroads, where, by agreement or otherwise, the companies have a common interest in the source from which it is obtained. Furthermore, we think the testimony competent as bearing upon the manner in which transportation rates are fixed, in view of determining the question of reasonableness of rates, into which the Commission has a right to inquire. To unreasonably hamper the Commission by narrowing its field of inquiry beyond the requirements of the due protection of rights of citizens will be to seriously impair its usefulness and prevent a realization of the salutary purposes for which it was established by Congress.\n An appeal is also prosecuted from the refusal of the circuit court to order the witnesses Eben B. Thomas and William H. Truesdale to answer certain questions respecting the prices and sale of coal. Upon the principles already discussed we think these questions had legitimate bearing upon the matters into which the Commission was making inquiry.\n We are of the opinion that the circuit court erred in holding the contracts for the purchase of coal by the companies or directly by the railroad, where a percentage of the price was agreed to be paid for the coal, to be irrelevant, and in refusing to order their production as evidence by the witnesses who are parties to the appeal, and likewise erred as to the Temple Iron Company contracts, and in refusing to require the witnesses aforesaid to answer the questions stated in the petition, and the order appealed from is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

APPEL(1904)\nNo. 108\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. F. Bowie, Thomas B. Bishop, and Bishop, Wheeler & Hoefler for appellant.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. W. Holcomb, W. C. Keegin, and J. H. McGowan for appellee.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the supreme court of the territory of Arizona, dismissing an appeal because taken too late. The appellee recovered a sum from the appellant in the court of first instance, and, after judgment was entered, the appellant moved for a new trial. The judge who tried the case, being unable to attend, made an order in chambers, continuing the motion to another term. At a later term, after several similar continuances, the motion was overruled, and the appellant then appealed to the supreme court of the territory. These events took place before the passage of the Arizona Revised Statutes of 1901. (See par. 1479.) It is assumed that the appeal was too late if the judgment became final at \n\n[192 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n the term when it was rendered (Revised Statutes of Arizona, 1887, par. 849 ), and we may assume further that the ground of dismissal was the paragraph of the Revised Statutes requiring that motions for new trials 'shall be determined at the term of the court at which the motion shall be made.' Rev. Stat. 1887, par. 837, and the further provision of par. 842. By the latter, as amended in 1891, 'when, upon motion, a new trial is denied,' a review by the supreme court is provided for, and it then is enacted that 'in case there shall be no ruling on said motion for a new trial during the term at which it was filed, then said motion shall be denied, and the questions that may have been raised thereby shall be subject to review by the supreme court as if said motion had been overruled and exceptions thereto reserved and entered on the minutes of the court.' Acts of 1891, No. 49, p. 69.\n The Arizona par. 837 is copied from a similar section in the Texas code, Act of May 13, 1846,  112, Hart's Dig. Texas Code, art. 766, 1 Sayles,' Texas Civ. Stat. art. 1372. Long before its adoption in Arizona the latter section had been construed in Texas as mandatory, and as discharging a motion by operation of law if not acted upon at the same term. It was held to put it out of the power of the court to postpone the motion for a new trial to the next term, and then to act upon it. If the requirement could be avoided by a continuance, it would be made almost nugatory. McKean v. Ziller, 9 Tex. 58; Bullock v. Ballew, 9 Tex. 498; Bass v. Hays, 38 Tex. 128. When a statute is taken in this way from another, even a foreign, state, it generally is presumed to be adopted with the construction which it has received. Tucker v. Oxley, 5 Cranch, 34, 42, 3 L. ed. 29, 31; Henrietta Min. & Mill. Co. v. Gardner, \n173 \nU.S. 123, 130\n, 43 S. L. ed. 637, 640, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 327; Com. v. Hartnett, 3 Gray, 450. See Coulam v. Doull, \n133 U.S. 216\n, 33 L. ed. 596, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 253. On this ground as well as that of the meaning of the words, the act had been construed as in Texas by the supreme court of Arizona. Ruff v. Hand, 24 Pac. 257. In view of the history of the section we shall spend no more time upon the question. Even \n\n[192 U.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n were it more doubtful, we are of opinion that the amendment of 1891 to par. 842 makes the meaning plain. The words 'then [necessarily after the end of the term] said motion shall be denied,' show that the motion is disposed of at the end of the term. Furthermore, they do not mean that an order must be made out of term because of the failure to make an order within it, but mean that the motion shall be barred by the lapse of time, adopting the decision of the year before in Ruff v. Hand, and save an exception as if the motion had been denied by the court. The amendment assumes or enacts that the motion is to be deemed overruled at the end of the term, and has for its object to give the party an exception in case he appeals from the judgment, so that the propriety of granting the motion may be reviewed along with the other matters brought before the supreme court. See Spicer v. Simms (Ariz.) 57 Pac. 610.\n It is urged that at least the statute cannot be meant to operate when the postponement is for the convenience of the court, and the case is likened to those where a judgment or order is entered nunc pro tunc in order to prevent a loss of rights through a delay caused by the court itself. But there is no need of an exception in such a case. The party's rights are saved, but transferred for consideration to a higher court, and were it otherwise we should hesitate to read the exception into such absolute words.\n It is said that by the foregoing construction the legislature attempts an unconstitutional assumption of judicial functions. But this is a mistake, both in form and substance. In form, because the legislature does not direct a judgment, but merely removes an obstacle to a judgment already entered. (We need not consider whether a different construction would be adopted if the statute dealt with the time for entering judgments .) In substance, because we no more can doubt the power of the legislature to enact a statute of limitations for motions for a new trial than we can doubt its power to enact such a statute for the bringing of an action. It may be questioned whether \n\n[192 U.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n there would be any constitutional objection to a law making the original judgment final, and doing away with new trials altogether. 'Rehearings, new trials, are not essential to due process of law, either in judicial or administrative proceedings.' Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 426\n, 38 S. L. ed. 1031, 1036, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1114. See Montana Co. v. St. Louis Min. & Mill. Co. \n152 \nU.S. 160, 171\n, 38 S. L. ed. 398, 400, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506. The statute did not deal with the past, or purport to grant or refuse a new trial in a case or cases then pending, but performed the proper legislative function of laying down a rule for the future in a matter as to which it had authority to lay down rules. Whether the attempt to grant a review of the motion in case of an appeal or writ of error was valid is not before us. But certainly it does not seem an extraordinary stretch of legislative power to say that if the right to have a motion considered is lost in the lower court by lapse of time, the motion may be considered on appeal. There is no judgment by the legislature, but simply a qualification of the time limit if the case goes up.\n Finally, it is argued that the sections, construed as we construe them, are inconsistent with the grant of common-law jurisdiction to the courts by Congress. Rev. Stat.  1868, 1908. It is said that the right to grant new trials was a well recognized incident of common-law jurisdiction, and that it cannot be taken away or cut down by the territorial legislature. In view of the provision in  1866, that the jurisdiction given by  1908 'shall be limited by law,' and, indeed, apart from it, we should hesitate to say that the territorial legislature was prevented by the grant of common-law jurisdiction, in general words, from doing away with new trials altogether. A rule of practice like this does not touch jurisdiction in any proper sense. Ferris v. Higley, 20 Wall. 375, 22 L. ed. 383, cited by the appellant, has no application. Apart from other differences, that was a case of an attempt to confer original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, both in chancery and common law, upon the probate courts. We certainly see nothing to prohibit the local legislature from making this not unusual usual or unreasonable rule. \n\n[192 U.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n See Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648, 21 L. ed. 966; Bent v. Thompson, \n138 U.S. 114\n, 34 L. ed. 902, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238; Greeley v. Winsor, 1 S. D. 618, 631, 48 N.

The case was removed to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Utah by defendant on the ground of diversity of citizenship.\n The facts were briefly these: August 5, 1900, Johnson was acting as head brakeman on a freight train of the Southern Pacific Company, which was making its regular trip between San Francisco, California, and Ogden, Utah. On reaching the town of Promontory, Utah, Johnson was directed to uncouple the engine from the train and couple it to a dining car, belonging to the company, which was standing on a side track, for the purpose of turning the car around preparatory to its being picked up and put on the next westbound passenger train. The engine and the dining car were equipped, respectively, with the Janney coupler and the Miller hook, so called, which would not couple together automatically by impact, and it was, therefore, necessary for Johnson, and he was ordered, to go between the engine and the dining car, to accomplish the coupling. In so doing Johnson's hand was caught between the engine bumper and the dining car bumper, and crushed, which necessitated amputation of the hand above the wrist.\n On the trial of the case, defendant, after plaintiff had rested, moved the court to instruct the jury to find in its favor, which motion was granted, and the jury found a verdict accordingly, on which judgment was entered. Plaintiff carried the case to the circuit court of appeals for the eighth Circuit, and the judgment was affirmed. 54 C. C. A. 508, 117 Fed. 462.\n Messrs. W. L. Maginnis, L. A. Shaver, and John M.

That any employee of any such common carrier who may be injured by any locomotive, car, or train in use contrary to the provision of this act shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed the risk thereby occasioned, although continuing in the employment of such carrier after the unlawful use of such locomotive, car, or train had been brought to his knowledge.'\n\n The circuit court of appeals held, in substance, Sanborn, J., delivering the opinion and Lochren, J., concurring, that the locomotive and car were both equipped as required by the act, as the one had a power driving-wheel brake and the other a coupler; that  2 did not apply to locomotives; that at the time of the accident the dining car was not 'used in moving interstate traffic;' and, moreover, that the locomotive, as well as the dining car, was furnished with an automatic coupler, so that each was equipped as the statute required if  2 applied to both. Thayer, J., concurred in the judgment on the latter ground, but was of opinion that locomotives were included by the words 'any car' in the 2d section, and that the dining car was being 'used in moving interstate traffic.'\n We are unable to accept these conclusions, notwithstanding the able opinion of the majority, as they appear to us to be inconsistent with the plain intention of Congress, to defeat the object of the legislation, and to be arrived at by an inadmissible narrowness of construction.\n The intention of Congress, declared in the preamble and in \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n  1 and 2 of the act, was 'to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads by compelling common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to equip their cars with automatic couplers and continuous brakes and their locomotives with driving-wheel brakes,' those brakes to be accompanied with 'appliances for operating the trainbrake system;' and every car to be 'equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars,' whereby the danger and risk consequent on the existing system was averted as far as possible.\n The present case is that of an injured employee, and involves the application of the act in respect of automatic couplers, the preliminary question being whether locomotives are required to be equipped with such couplers. And it is not to be successfully denied that they are so required if the words 'any car' of the 2d section were intended to embrace, and do embrace, locomotives. But it is said that this cannot be so because locomotives were elsewhere, in terms, required to be equipped with power driving-wheel brakes, and that the rule that the expression of one thing excludes another applies. That, however, is a question of intention, and as there was special reason for requiring locomotives to be equipped with power drivingwheel brakes, if it were also necessary that locomotives should be equipped with automatic couplers, and the word 'car' would cover locomotives, then the intention to limit the equipment of locomotives to power driving-wheel brakes, because they were separately mentioned, could not be imputed. Now it was as necessary for the safety of employees in coupling and uncoupling that locomotives should be equipped with automatic couplers as it was that freight and passenger and dining cars should be; perhaps more so, as Judge Thayer suggests, 'since engines have occasion to make couplings more frequently.'\n And manifestly the word 'car' was used in its generic sense. There is nothing to indicate that any particular kind \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n of car was meant. Tested by context, subjectmatter, and object, 'any car' meant all kinds of cars running on the rails, including locomotives. And this view is supported by the dictionary definitions and by many judicial decisions, some of them having been rendered in construction of this act. Winkler v. Philadelphia %& r. r\/. Co. 4 Penn. (Del.) 387, 53 Atl. 90; Fleming v. Southern R. Co. 131 N. C. 476, 42 S. E. 905;East St. Louis Connecting R. Co. v. O'Hara, 150 Ill. 580, 37 N. E. 917; Kansas City, M. & B. R. Co. v. Crocker, 95 Ala. 412, 11 So. 262; Thomas v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. 38 Ga. 222; New York v. Third Ave. R. Co. 117 N. y. 404, 22 N. E. 755; Benson v. Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. 75 Minn. 163, 74 Am. St. Rep. 444, 77 N. W. 798.\n The result is that if the locomotive in question was not equipped with automatic couplers, the company failed to comply with the provisions of the act. It appears, however, that this locomotive was in fact equipped with automatic couplers, as well as the dining car; but that the couplers on each, which were of different types, would not couple with each other automatically, by impact, so as to render it unnecessary for men to go between the cars to couple and uncouple.\n Nevertheless, the circuit court of appeals was of opinion that it would be anunwarrantable extension of the terms of the law to hold that where the couplers would couple automatically with couplers of their own kind, the couplers must so couple with couplers of different kinds. But we think that what the act plainly forbade was the use of cars which could not be coupled together automatically by impact, by means of the couplers actually used on the cars to be coupled. The object was to protect the lives and limbs of railroad employees by rendering it unnecessary for a man operating the couplers to go between the ends of the cars; and that object would be defeated, not necessarily by the use of automatic couplers of different kinds, but if those different kinds would not automatically couple with each other. The point was that the \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n railroad companies should be compelled, respectively, to adopt devices, whatever they were, which would act so far uniformly as to eliminate the danger consequent on men going between the cars.\n If the language used were open to construction, we are constrained to say that the construction put upon the act by the circuit court of appeals was altogether too narrow.\n This strictness was thought to be required because the common-law rule as to the assumption of risk was changed by the act, and because the act was penal.\n The dogma as to the strict construction of statutes in derogation of the common law only amounts to the recognition of a presumption against an intention to change existing law; and as there is no doubt of that intention here, the extent of the application of the change demands at least no more rigorous construction than would be applied to penal laws. And, as Chief Justice Parker remarked, conceding that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be construed strictly, 'They are also to be construed sensibly, and with a view to the object aimed at by the legislature.' Gibson v. Jenney, 15 Mass. 205.\n The primary object of the act was to promote the public welfare by securing the safety of employees and travelers; and it was in that aspect remedial; while for violations a penalty of $100, recoverable in a civil action, was provided for, and in that aspect it was penal. But the design to give relief was more dominant than to inflict punishment, and the act might well be held to fall within the rule applicable to statutes to prevent fraud upon the revenue, and for the collection of customs,-that rule not requiring absolute strictness of construction. Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 11 L. ed. 559; United States v. Stowell, \n133 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 33 S. L. ed. 555, 558, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244, and cases cited. And see Farmers' %& m. n\/at. Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29, 35\n, 23 S. L. ed. 196, 199; Gray v. Bennett, 3 Met. 529.\n Moreover, it is settled that 'though penal laws are to be construed strictly, yet the intention of the legislature must \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n govern in the construction of penal as well as other statutes; and they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.' United States v. Lacher, \n134 U.S. 624\n, 33 L. ed. 1080, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625. In that case we cited and quoted from United States v. Winn, 3 Sumn. 209, Fed. Cas No. 16,740, in which Mr. Justice Story, referring to the rule that penal statutes are to be construed strictly, said:\n'I agree to that rule in its true and sober sense; and that is, that penal statutes are not to be enlarged by implication, or extended to cases not obviously within their words and purport. But where the words are general, and include various classes of persons, I know of no authority which would justify the court in restricting them to one class, or in giving them the narrowest interpretation, where the mischief to be redressed by the statute is equally applicable to all of them. And where a word is used in a statute which has various known significations, I know of no rule that requires the court to adopt one in preference to another, simply because it is more restained, if the objects of the statute equally apply to the largest and broadest sense of the word. In short, it appears to me that the proper course in all these cases is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.'\n\n Tested by these principles, we think the view of the circuit court of appeals, which limits the 2d section to merely providing automatic couplers, does not give due effect to the words 'coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the cars,' and cannot be sustained.\n We dismiss, as without merit, the suggestion which has been made, that the words 'without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars,' which are the test of compliance with  2, apply only to the act of uncoupling. The phrase literally covers both coupling and uncoupling; and if \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n read, as it should be, with a comma after the word 'uncoupled,' this becomes entirely clear. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Voelker, 129 Fed. 522; United States v. Lacher, \n134 U.S. 624\n, 33 L. ed. 1080, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625.\n The risk in coupling and uncoupling was the evil sought to be remedied, and that risk was to be obviated by the use of couplers actually coupling automatically. True, no particular design was required, but, whatever the devices used, they were to be effectively interchangeable. Congress was not paltering in a double sense. And its intention is found 'in the language actually used, interpreted according to its fair and obvious meaning.' United States v. Harris, \n177 U.S. 309\n, 44 L. ed. 782, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609.\n That this was the scope of the statute is confirmed by the circumstances surrounding its enactment, as exhibited in public documents to which we are at liberty to refer. Binns v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1087, 1091, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 816; Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 36 S. L. ed. 226, 229, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511.\n President Harrison, in his annual messages of 1889, 1890, 1891, and 1892, earnestly urged upon Congress the necessity of legislation to obviate and reduce the loss of life and the injuries due to the prevailing method of coupling and braking. In his first message he said: 'It is competent, I think, for Congress to require uniformity in the construction of cars used in interstate commerce, and the use of improved safety appliances upon such trains. Time will be necessary to make the needed changes, but an earnest and intelligent beginning should be made at once. It is a reproach to our civilization that any class of American workmen should, in the pursuit of a necessary and useful vocation, be subjected to a peril of life and limb as great as that of a soldier in time of war.'\n And he reiterated his recommendation in succeeding messages, saying in that for 1892: 'Statistics furnished by the Interstate Commerce Commission show that during the year ending June 30, 1891, there were forty-seven different styles of car couplers reported to be in use, and that during the same period there was 2,660 employees killed and 26,140 injured. \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n Nearly 16 per cent of the deaths occurred in the coupling and uncoupling of cars, and over 36 per cent of the injuries had the same origin.'\n The Senate report of the first session of the Fifty-second Congress ( No. 1049) and the House report of the same session (No. 1678) set out the numerous and increasing casualties due to coupling, the demand for protection, and the necessity of automatic couplers, coupling interchangeably. The difficulties in the case were fully expounded and the result reached to require an automatic coupling by impact so as to render it unnecessary for men to go between the cars; while no particular device or type was adopted, the railroad companies being left free to work out the details for themselves, ample time being given for that purpose. The law gave five years, and that was enlarged, by the Interstate Commerce Commission, as authorized by law, two years, and subsequently seven months, making seven years and seven months in all.\n The diligence of counsel has called our attention to changes made in the bill in the course of its passage, and to the debates in the Senate on the report of its committee. 24 Cong. Rec., pt. 2, pp. 1246, 1273 et seq. These demonstrate that the difficulty as to interchangeability was fully in the mind of Congress, and was assumed to be met by the language which was used. The essential degree of uniformity was secured by providing that the couplings must couple automatically by impact without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.\n In the present case the couplings would not work together; Johnson was obliged to go between the cars; and the law was not complied with.\n March 2, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 943, chap. 970),1 an act in amendment of the act of 1893 was approved, which provided, among other things, that the provisions and requirements of the former act 'shall be held to apply to common carriers by railroads in the territories and the district of Columbia, and shall apply in all cases, whether or not the couplers brought together are of the \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n same kind, make, or type;' and 'shall be held to apply to all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce.'\n This act was to take effect September 1st, 1903, and nothing in it was to be held or construed to relieve any common carrier 'from any of the provisions, powers, duties, liabilities, or requirements' of the act of 1893, all of which should apply except as specifically amended.\n As we have no doubt of the meaning of the prior law, the subsequent legislation cannot be regarded as intended to operate to destroy it. Indeed, the latter act is affirmative and declaratory; and, in effect, only construed and applied the former act. bailey v. Clark, 21 Wall. 284, 22 L. ed. 651; United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 11 L. ed. 724; Cope v. Cope, \n137 U.S. 682\n, 34 L. ed. 832, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; Wetmore v. Markoe, \n196 U.S. 68\n, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 172, 49 L. ed. 390. This legislative recognition of the scope of the prior law fortifies, and does not weaken, the conclusion at which we have arrived.\n Another ground on which the decision of the circuit court of appeals was rested remains to be noticed. That court held by a majority that, as the dining car was empty and had not actually entered upon its trip, it was not used in moving interstate traffic, and hence was not within the act. The dining car had been constantly used for several years to furnish meals to passengers between San Francisco and Ogden, and for no other purpose. On the day of the accident the eastbound train was so late that it was found that the car could not reach Ogden in time to return on the next westbound train according to intention, and it was therefore dropped off at Promontory, to be picked up by that train as it came along that evening.\n The presumption is that it was stocked for the return; and as it was not a new car, or a car just from the repair shop, on its way to its field of labor, it was not 'an empty,' as that term is sometimes used. Besides, whether cars are empty or loaded, the danger to employees is practically the same, and we agree with the observation of District Judge Shiras, in Voelker v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. 116 Fed. 867, that 'it can- \n\n[196 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n not be true that on the eastern trip the provisions of the act of Congress would be binding upon the company, because the cars were loaded, but would not be binding upon the return trip, because the cars are empty.'\n Counsel urges that the character of the dining car at the time and place of the injury was local only, and could not be changed until the car was actually engaged in interstate movement, or being put into a train for such use, and Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, is cited as supporting that contention. In Coe v. Errol it was held that certain logs cut in New Hampshire, and hauled to a river in order that they might be transported to Maine, were subject to taxation in the former state before transportation had begun.\n The distinction between merchandise which may become an article of interstate commerce, or may not, and an instrument regularly used in moving interstate commerce, which has stopped temporarily in making its trip between two points in different states, renders this and like cases inapplicable.\n Confessedly this dining car was under the control of Congress while in the act of making its interstate journey, and in our judgment it was equally so when waiting for the train to be made up for the next trip. It was being regularly used in the movement of interstate traffic, and so within the law.\n Finally, it is argued that, Johnson was guilty of such contributory negligence as to defeat recovery, and that, therefore, the judgment should be affirmed. But the circuit court of appeals did not consider this question, nor apparently did the circuit court, and we do not feel constrained to inquire whether it could have been open under  8, or, if so, whether it should have been left to the jury, under proper instructions.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; the judgment of the Circuit Court is also reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with instructions to set saide the verdict, and award a new trial. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

MONTAGUE(1904)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: April 25, 1904\n\n\n\n\n On November 14, 1902, plaintiffs in error filed in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Virginia in behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, their petition for a writ of prohibition. The petition set forth that the petitioners were citizens of the United States, citizens and residents of the state of Virginia, and of the third Congressional district of that state, and entitled to vote at the election held on November 4, 1902, for a member of the House of Representatives of the United States from that district; that they applied to the proper registration board for registration, and were refused. it was further alleged that in 1901 a constitutional convention was assembled in Virginia; that it framed a new constitution; that it did not submit such constitution to the people for approval, but, by a vote of forty- seven to thirty-eight, ordained it as the organic law of the state. Attached to the petition were copies of the constitution, of a schedule making provisions for putting in force the new constitution without inconvenience, and of an ordinance providing for the registration of voters, all of which were adopted by the same convention. The petitioners also charge that the purpose of the party in power was the disfranchisement of the colored voters of the state, and specifically set forth how this disfranchisement was to be accomplished. They averred that at the election held on November 4, 1902, only the registration lists provided for by the ordinance were recognized; that abstracts \n\n[194 U.S. 147, 148]\n\u00a0\n of the votes cast in the several cities and counties were certified to the secretary of the commonwealth, at Richmond, Virginia, and that the defendants, as the board of state canvassers, would assemble on the 24th of November, 1902, and would, unless prohibited, canvass the election returns, declare the result, and give certificates to the parties found to be elected. The prayer of the petition was that a writ of prohibition issue to the defendants, 'prohibiting them, and each of them, from considering, canvassing, counting, determining upon, or certifying or otherwise acting upon, any returns or abstracts of returns in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth of Virginia, purporting to be returns of election held in the state of Virginia, Tuesday, November 4, 1902, for representatives in Congress from the state of Virginia, or in any wise dealing with or certifying the results of said returns as returns of a lawful election, held in Virginia on the date aforesaid. That by reason of the matters and things hereinabove set forth, said pretended election, and any and all precinct, county, district, or state returns made thereunder, may be held to be null, void, and of no affect, and the said board of state canvassers, and the members thereof, may be prohibited from in any wise proceeding to act upon the same as lawfully before them for their consideration. That pending the hearing, and until the final decision upon this petition for said writ of prohibition, an order may be granted by this honorable court suspending any and all proceedings, on the part of said board of state canvassers and the members thereof, upon any and all of the matters sought to be prohibited until the final decision of this cause. And for such other and further orders in the premises as shall and may make the prayer of your petitioners effectual.'\n After answer by defendants, the writ of prohibition was denied by the circuit court, and the petition dismissed. The dismissal was based on a want of jurisdiction; whereupon the petitioners brought the case on error directly to this court. A motion has here been made to dismiss the writ of error on the \n\n[194 U.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n ground that everything sought to be prohibited has already been done, and that there is nothing upon which any order of the court can operate. In support of the motion an affidavit of the secretary of the commonwealth has been filed, to the effect that after the dismissal of the petition by the circuit court the board of canvassers convened at the office of the secretary in accordance with the law of the state, and, upon the returns then on file, canvassed the votes, determined the parties found by such canvass to have been elected, and that a certificate to that effect had been prepared and transmitted to each of the persons declared to have been elected a representative in Congress from the state of Virginia.\nMr. John S. Wise for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William A. Anderson and Frank W. Christian for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, is decisive, and compels a dismissal of the writ of error. That was a suit in equity, alleging the calling of a convention to revise the Constitution of South Carolina, and seeking to enjoin an alleged illegal, partial, and void registration by which the plaintiff, and others like him, would be deprived of the right to vote for delegates to the convention. An injunction was granted by the circuit court, but was dissolved by the circuit court of appeals, and the suit dismissed. Thereupon the election was held, the convention met and entered upon the discharge of its duties. An appeal to this court from the order of dismissal made by the circuit court of appeals was dismissed on the ground that the object of the suit could no longer be attained. Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion, said (pp. 653, 657, 658, L. ed. pp. 294, 295, Sup. Ct. Rep. pp. 133, 134, 135):\n'The duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, \n\n[194 U.S. 147, 152]\n\u00a0\n is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it. It necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal. . . . In the case at bar the whole object of the bill was to secure a right to vote at the election, to be held, as the bill alleged, on the third Tuesday of August, 1895, of delegates to the constitutional convention of South Carolina. Before this appeal was taken by the plaintiff from the decree of the circuit court of appeals dismissing his bill, that date had passed; and, before the entry of the appeal in this court, the convention had assembled, pursuant to the statute of South Carolina of 1894, by which the convention had been called. 21 Stat. of S. C. pp. 802, 803. The election of the delegates and the assembling of the convention are public matters, to be taken notice of by the court, without formal plea or proof. . . . It is obvious, therefore, that, even if the bill could properly be held to present a case within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, no relief within the scope of the bill could now be granted.'\n\n See also Codlin v. Kohlhausen, \n181 U.S. 151\n, 45 L. ed. 793, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584; Tennessee v. Condon, \n189 U.S. 64\n, 47 L. ed. 709, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 579.\n The case before us is one in prohibition. It is so declared by the petitioners in their petition, and the thing sought to be prohibited was a canvass of the votes cast at the election on November 4, 1902. The facts alleged in respect to the Constitution, the purpose of the dominant party, the action of the convention, the refusal to submit the proposed Constitution to the vote of the people, and the registration ordinance, were all stated for the purpose of showing that the election on November 4, 1902, was illegal, and that there ought to be no \n\n[194 U.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n canvass of the returns cast at that election. The prayer of the petitioners specifically is to restrain such canvass. Even the general clause at the close of the prayer is 'for such other and further orders in the premises as shall and may make the prayer of your petitioners effectual.' But-as shown by the affidavit, and as, indeed, we might, perhaps, take judicial notice by the presence in the House of Representatives of the individuals elected at that election from the various congressional districts of Virginia-the thing sought to be prohibited has been done, and cannot be undone by any order of court. The canvass has been made, certificates of election have been issued, the House of Representatives (which is the sole judge of the qualifications of its members) has admitted the parties holding the certificates to seats in that body, and any adjudication which this court might make would be only an ineffectual decision of the question whether or not these petitioners were wronged by what has been fully accomplished. Under those circumstances there is nothing but a moot case remaining, and the motion to dismiss must be sustained.\n Dismissed without costs to either party. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOPLIN v. CHACHERE(1904)\nNo. 96\nArgued: December 16, 1903Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This action was brought by the eighteenth judicial district court, parish of Acadia, state of Louisiana, by plaintiff in error, to have himself declared the owner of a tract of land containing 870.06 acres, described as section 41, township 7 south, range 1 east. Subsequently he amended his petition and claimed one tenth individually and nine tenths as administrator of the succession of Bennet Joplin. He traced title in both capacities to Bennet Joplin, to whom the land was confirmed by the act of Congress, approved March 3, 1807, entitled 'An Act Respecting Claims of Land in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana.' 2 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 36. This act was an amendment to the act of March 2, 1805 (2 Stat. at L. 324, chap. 26), which provided for ascertaining and adjusting the titles and claims to land within the same territory. The purpose of both acts was to recognize and establish the titles possessed by the inhabitants of that territory prior to its acquisition by the United States.\n Section 4 of the act of 1807 provided:\n'That the commissioners appointed or to be appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of persons claiming land in the territories of Orleans and Louisiana shall have full powers to decide according to the laws and established usages and customs of the French and Spanish governments, upon \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n all claims to lands within their respective districts, where the claim is made by any person or persons, or the legal representative of any person or persons who were, on the 20th of December, one thousand eight hundred and three, inhabitants of Louisiana, and for a tract not exceeding the quantity of acres contained in a league square, and which does not include either a lead mine or salt spring, which decision of the commissioners, when in favor of the claimant, shall be final against the United States, any act of Congress to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n A patent was issued July 16, 1900, in favor of Bennet Joplin, heirs and assigns. Stating the recitals of the patent and some other facts, the supreme court of Louisiana said:\n'That it [the patent] was granted in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1807. It declares there had been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States a patent certificate numbered 1499, issued by the register and receiver of the United States Land Office, on the 25th of May, 1900, whereby it appeared that the private land claim of Bennet Joplin, being numbered 1927, class B, in the report of the old board of commissioners for the western district of the territory of Orleans, was confirmed by the said commissioners under the authority conferred upon them by the act of Congress approved on the 3d of March, 1807, entitled 'An Act Respecting Claims to Land in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana;' that the claim had been regularly surveyed and designated as section 49 in township 7 south, of range 1 west, and section 41 in township 7 south, of range 1 east, of the Louisiana meridian, in the southwestern district of Louisiana, containing 870 acres and 6 hundredths of an acre, as appeared by a plat and descriptive notes on file (in the General Land Office) thereof, duly examined and approved by James Lewis, surveyor \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n general for Louisiana, on the 9th day of May, 1900. That this plat and descriptive notes were inserted and made part of the patent.\n\n'The plat and descriptive notes referred to were signed, as recited, by James Lewis, surveyor general of Louisiana, on the 9th of May, 1900\n\n\n\n'Immediately following the plat the surveyor general recites that it represents the survey of the private land claim of Bennet Joplin, confirmed by the old board of commissioners for the western district of Louisiana, in pursuance of the authority conferred upon them by the 4th section of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1807, entitled 'An Act Respecting Claims to Lands in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana,' as appeared by their confirmation certificate No. B, 1927, dated March 11, 1812. After making this recital, the surveyor general says: 'The following being a description of the survey taken from the approved field notes of N. B. Phelps, deputy surveyor.' He then gives the field notes of the survey.\n\n'At the end of the document, under date of May 9th, 1900, are the words 'examined and approved,' followed by the signature of the surveyor general.'\n\n The defendants Chachere and Boagni depended for title upon purchases from Victor C. Sittig, by authentic acts duly recorded. Sittig purchased the same at tax sale in 1871. The defendants pleaded that Sittig and themselves had the uninterrupted, peaceable, and actual possession of the land in good faith since 1871; had erected improvements thereon and paid taxes. They also pleaded the prescription of three, four, five, ten, and twenty years. Victor Sittig was called in warranty and made the same defenses.\n The district court decreed that the claim of plaintiff be rejected, the plea of prescription set up by defendants be sustained, and they be quieted in their title and possession of the land. The supreme court of the state affirmed the decree, and the case was then brought here. Other facts are stated in the opinion. \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel D. McEnery, George S. Dodds, and Mark M. Boatner for plaintiff in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Gilbert L. Dupr e and E. D. Saunders for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question presented is the effect of the defense of adverse possession and the plea of prescription. The contention of plaintiff in error is that such defense cannot avail against a United States patent. In other words, until the issue of the patent the title was in the United States, and was unaffected by the occupation of the defendants.\n Counsel say:\n'The confirmation to Joplin by act of Congress was only as to quantity, and not to any specifically described tract of land. There was only an equitable interest in Joplin and his heirs until a survey should be made and approved by the surveyor general, segregating his part from the public domain, and from conflicting claims. The survey of 1856 was not approved until May 9, 1900, when the receiver and register approved said survey, giving to Joplin and to conflicting claimants the tracts to which they were entitled under the confirmation. It was only then that the complete legal title was vested in Joplin and his heirs to the tract of land in controversy. It was only from this time that prescription commences.\n\n Is the contention of counsel justified? They cite Langdeau v. Hanes, 21 Wall. 521, 22 L. ed. 606, and Morrow v. Whitney, \n95 U.S. 551\n, 24 L. ed. 456. To determine the application of those cases there are important facts to be considered. The supreme court of Louisiana said:\n'We do not think there is any dispute between the parties as to the facts. That, on the 12th of March, 1812, the board of commissioners appointed under  4 of the act of Congress, approved March 3, 1807, confirmed to Bennet Joplin under certificate No. 1,927, by virtue of occupancy and settlement under Joseph Chevalier Poiret, 913.98 acres of land in Bayou Mallet woods, in the county of Opelousas. That on April 29, 1861 [3 Stat. at L. 329, chap. 159], Congress reciting the various acts bearing upon the subject (act of March 10, 1812 [2 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 38], act of February 27, 1813 [2 Stat. at L. 807, chap. 38], and act of April, \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n 1814 [3 Stat. at L. 121, chap. 52]) passed an act for the confirmation of certain land claims in the western district of the state of Louisiana, and that under  1 of that act it was enacted 'that the claims marked 'B.' described in the reports of the commissioners for the western district of the state of Louisiana, formerly territory of Orleans, and recommended by them for confirmation, be, and the same are hereby, confirmed.' That the claim of Bennet Joplin covered by certificate No. 1,927 of the board of commissioners, was confirmed in favor of Joplin by that act of Congress. That although the claim was so confirmed by act of Congress, no patent was issued for the land by the United States government until July 1900.'\n\n In other words, the land claimed by Poiret was identified by his possession. It contained a definite quantity. Fractions of acres were even regarded, and almost necessarily. The right of a claimant depended upon possession, and naturally its extent was marked by definite boundaries. How else could a claim have any strength at all,-any right to confirmation at all? The certificates issued by the commissioners were denominated grants (7), and they were required to designate a tract of land (6). Section 7, it is true, provided for a survey. The provision is 'that the tracts of land thus granted by the commissioners shall be surveyed at the expense of the parties, under the direction of the surveyor general,' in all cases where authenticated plats of the land, as surveyed by the French, Spanish, and American governments, respectively, shall not have been filed with the proper register and recorder, or shall not appear on the public records of the territories. The surveying officer was required to transmit general and particular plats of land thus surveyed to the proper register and recorder, and copies to the Secretary of the Treasury. The duties of the officers under the act may be summarized a follows: (1) The commissioners to investigate the claim, and, if they confirmed it, to issue a certificate thereof, and transmit a transcript of their final decision to the Secretary of the Treasury. (2) The register and receiver, upon the filing of the \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 102]\n\u00a0\n certificate with him and a plat of the land being also filed with him by the surveyor general or officer acting as surveyor general, should issue a certificate, which, being transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, would entitle the party to a patent. (3) The survey of the land by the surveyor general or officer acting as such. (4) Reports by the Secretary of the Treasury to Congress 'for their final determination hereon, in the manner and at the time heretofore prescribed by law for that purpose.' There is no evidence that the register and receiver issued a certificate other than that mentioned in the patent. The commissioners performed the duties required of them and the Secretary of the Treasury performed his. And a survey was made of the land in 1856.\n Under these facts did the title pass by the confirmation expressed in the act of Congress of April 29, 1816 (3 Stat. at L. 328, chap. 159), or, at the latest, upon the survey in 1856, or did it pass by the patent in July, 1900? For answer we may refer to the cases cited by the plaintiff in error.\n In Langdeau v. Hanes, the contest was between a title claimed by virtue of the act of Congress, March 26, 1804 [2 Stat. at L. 277, chap. 35 ], which confirmed claims to lands in the district of Vincennes, and a title claimed by adverse possession. It was provided by the act of Congress that a person to whom land is confirmed, whenever his claim shall have been located and surveyed; shall be entitled to the certificate from the register and receiver, which certificate shall entitle him to a patent. The tract in dispute was surveyed in 1820, but a patent was not issued until 1872. The defendant's claim of title rested on an adverse possession of thirty years. The state court held that the act of confirmation of 1807 was a present grant, and became so far operative and complete as to convey the legal title when the land was located and surveyed by the United States in 1820; second, the patent was not of itself a grant of the land, but only evidence of a grant; third, the adverse possession of the defendant was a bar to the recovery by the plaintiff. These propositions were affirmed by this court. The \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n court held that the act of Congress of 1804 was a recognition and discharge of the obligation incurred by the government upon acquiring the territory from Virginia, to protect and confirm the possession and titles of the inhabitants to their property. And it was held that it was competent for Congress to provide how that it should be done, and Congress required a presentation of the claims to the register and receiver of the land office, constituted them commissioners to pass upon the claims 'according to justice and equity,' and to transmit to the Secretary of the Treasury a transcript of their decisions with his report. The Secretary of the Treasury submitted the decisions and the report to Congress, as he has required to do, and Congress passed the act of 1807 to confirm them. The court said:\n'This confirmation was the fulfillment of the condition stipulated in the deed of cession so far as the claimants were concerned. It was an authoritative recognition by record of the ancient possession and title of their ancestor, and gave to them such assurance of the validity of that possession and title as would be always respected by the courts of the country. The subsequent clause of the act providing for the issue of a patent to the claimants when their claim was located and surveyed took nothing from the force of the confirmation.\n\n'In the legislation of Congress a patent has a double operation. It is a conveyance by the government when the government has any interest to convey, but where it is issued upon the confirmation of a claim of a previously existing title it is documentary evidence, having the dignity of a record, of the existence of that title, or of such equities respecting the claim as justify its recognition and confirmation. The instrument is not the less efficacious as evidence of previously existing rights because it also embodies words of release or transfer from the government.\n\n'In the present case the patent would have been of great value to the claimants as record evidence of the ancient possession and title of their ancestor, and of the recognition and con- \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 104]\n\u00a0\n firmation by the United States, and would have obviated in any controversies at law respecting the land the necessity of other proof, and would thus have been to them an instrument of quiet and security. But it would have added nothing to the force of the confirmation. The survey required for the patent was only to secure certainty of description in the instrument, and to inform the government of the quantity reserved to private parties from the domain ceded by Virginia.\n\n'The whole error of the plaintiff arises from his theory that the fee to the land in controversy passed to the United States by the cession from Virginia, and that a patent was essential to its transfer to the claimants, whereas, with respect to the lands convered by the possession of the inhabitants and settlers mentioned in the deed of cession, the fee never passed to the United States, and if it had passed, and a mere equitable title had remained in the claimants after the cession, the confirmation by the act of 1807 would have operated as a release to them of the interest of the United States. A legislative confirmation of a claim to land is a recognition of the validity of such claim, and operates as effectually as a grant or quit-claim from the government.'\n\n This doctrine was repeated in morrow v. Whitney, \n95 U.S. 551\n, 24 L. ed. 456. The question arose upon the ruling of the trial court refusing to admit a patent of the United States in evidence. Sustaining the ruling, this court said:\n'In this case, the patent would have been of great value to the claimant. It would have enabled him, without other proof, to maintain his title in the tribunals of the country. Founded as it would have been upon a survey by the government, it would have removed the doubt as to the boundaries of the tract, which always arises where their establishment rests in the uncertain recollection of witnesses as to ancient possession. It would thus have proved to its possessor an instrument of quiet and security, but it would not have added anything to the interest vested by the confirmation. Ryan v. Carter, \n93 U.S. 78\n, 23 L. ed. 807.' \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 105]\n\u00a0\n These cases are not in conflict with Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 93, 20 L. ed. 534, as was observed in Langdeau v. Hanes. The land in controversy had been part of the public lands of the United States. The title of Gibson was derived under the act of Congress of February 17, 1815, for the relief of the inhabitants of the county of New Madrid, in the territory of Missouri, who had suffered by earthquakes. 3 Stat. at L. 211, chap. 45. James T. O'Carroll obtained permission from the Spanish authorities to settle on vacant lands in the district of New Madrid, in the territory of Louisiana, and in pursuance of the permission he settled upon a tract embracing about 1,000 arpents of land, in that part of the country which afterwards comprised the county of New Madrid in the territory of Missouri. The land settled upon, to the extent of 640 acres, was confirmed to O'Carroll by different acts of Congress. In 1812 the land was injured by an earthquake, and, upon proof of the fact, the recorder of land titles at St. Louis gave a certificate to that effect, which authorized the location of a like quantity on any of the public lands of the territory of Missouri, a sale of which was authorized by law. Under this certificate the land in dispute was located. The land located had been previously surveyed, but for some cause the survey and plat were not returned to the recorder until August, 1841. The recorder then issued a patent certificate to 'James T. O'Carroll or his legal representatives.' The survey was not approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, because it did not show its interferences with conflicting claimants. A new survey and plat were made, showing interferences, and were filed with the recorder on the 26th of March, 1862, and a new patent certificate issued. In the following June the patent of the United States was issued to Mary McRee, who had acquired the interest of the locator by various mesne conveyances. In August following she conveyed to Gibson. Against the title thus acquired, among other defenses, adverse possession for the period prescribed by the statute of Missouri was pleaded. The plea was sustained. The judgment was reversed by this court. \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 106]\n\u00a0\n It is obvious that there is a clear distinction between the case and Langdeau v. Hanes and Morrow v. Whitney. The act of 1815 did not confirm to O'Carroll the tract of land which he obtained from the Spanish authorities. It only enabled him or his representatives to locate a like quantity of the public land, and a segregation of that quantity and its exact identification were necessary, and this did not occur until the issue of the patent in 1862. The patent, therefore, was not the mere formal assurance of a title that had been conveyed by another government, but it was the conveyance of the title of this government after conditions performed, which authorized but did not anticipate it, nor were they its equivalent. The case at bar, therefore, does not come under the precedent of Gibson v. Chouteau; it comes under that of Langdeau v. Hanes and morrow v. Whitney.\n\n Plaintiff in error claims under Joplin, who claimed under Poiret, who claimed under the French government. And it was the title to a tract of land thus claimed that the commissioners under the act of 1807 adjudicated and granted, and it was that title which was confirmed by the act of April 29, 1816.\n What element, then, is wanting? Plaintiff in error says the identification of the land,-its complete definition by boundaries,-and until this was done the title was in the United States. We need not dispute the principle upon which the contention rests. We think its conditions were satisfied. Poiret's title was obtained by occupation, and the right of his successor, Joplin, depended upon that, and by that the award of the commissioners could only have been measured. It is not conceivable that the boundaries of the tract were not ascertained by them. Their certificate, as was seen, expressed an exact quantity, 918.98 acres, and having a frontage of 1,080 arpents. The evidence before the commissioners is not exhibited, but there was a survey in 1856. The remarks of the supreme court of Louisiana are, therefore, apposite:\n'It is evident that Poiret was shown to the board to have already occupied and settled a particular body of land for the time \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 107]\n\u00a0\n stated, and to have already had an existing right or privilege to a particular tract. The identity of the tract confirmed must have been fixed by evidence before the board, and the survey which followed was unquestionably based upon that evidence, preserved and made known to the surveyor. The Joplin claim under Poiret was not based upon the survey, but the survey was based upon the existing claim, and simply identified the land to which Poiret and Joplin were entitled by antecedent occupancy and settlement.'\n\n Speaking of the survey, the court said:\n'If, however, a survey of the claim was necessary in order to complete the transfer of ownership of this property to Joplin, we are satisfied that a survey of the same was made and approved by the surveyor general, W. J. McCulloh, as far back as 1856. The present surveyor general of Louisiana refers to the survey and field notes of Phelps as having been approved, but not as a matter of original approval by himself, as the plaintiff seems to contend. In the act of sale of this land under which the plaintiff claims from James W. Joplin to James H. Houston, Jr., the land transferred is referred to as a 'Spanish grant' with the added words ( see parish map and a list of private land claims, where the above described property is well defined as belonging to Bennet Joplin). We have before us a copy of the parish map here referred to, with the different private claims (among others that of Bennet Joplin) distinctly set out, and the surveys on which they were located minutely detailed, certified to as far back as 1856 by the surveyor general. It may be that it is not strictly and technically in evidence, but it is before us by reference in one of the acts, and were we not to act upon it the only effect would be to remand uselessly the case in order to have it formally introduced.'\n\n Bennet Joplin, it was testified, died before the assessment was made upon which the tax sale upon which the title of the defendants in error depended, and the validity of the assessment, therefore, is denied, because it was not made in the name of the owner, as required by the statute of the state of 1870. \n\n[192 U.S. 94, 108]\n\u00a0\n The assessment is also attacked for nonconformity with the statutes in other particulars. In passing on the questions thus raised the supreme court of Louisiana construed the statutes of the state differently from plaintiff in error, and answered all the questions on grounds not Federal, and which, therefore, we need not discuss.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJULIAN v. CENTRAL TRUST CO.(1904)\nNo. 139\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 93, 94]\n\u00a0\n On May 2, 1894, a decree was entered in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of North Carolina foreclosing a second mortgage of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company to the Central Trust Company of New York, trustee. The property was subject to a first mortgage to the same trustee, which was not in default. The decree provided:\n'The purchaser or purchasers of the property herein decreed to be sold,' the Western North Carolina Railroad and its franchises, 'shall be invested with and shall hold, possess, and enjoy the said mortgaged premises and property herein decreed to be sold, and all the rights, privileges, and franchises appertaining thereto, as fully and completely as the Western North Carolina Railroad now holds and enjoys, or has heretofore held and enjoyed the same; and further, the said purchaser or purchasers shall have and be entitled to hold the said railroad and property discharged of and from the lien of the mortgage foreclosed in this suit, and from the claims of the parties to this suit or any of them, except the first consolidated mortgage of September 1st, 1884.'\n\n In pursuance of this decree the Southern Railway Company, a corporation of the state of Virginia, became the purchaser. On August 22, 1894, the sale was confirmed, the decree of confirmation providing, among other things:\n'It is further ordered and decreed that the special master is hereby authorized and directed, on the request of said purchaser, to sign, seal, execute, acknowledge, and deliver a proper deed of conveyance to the said Southern Railway Company, conveying to it, all and singular, the railroad, equipment, property, and franchises so as aforesaid sold under the decree \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 95]\n\u00a0\n of this court, free from any and all equity of redemption of the said Western North Carolina Railroad Company, or anyone claiming by, under, or through it, except the prior mortgage recited in such decree. Upon the delivery of such conveyance by the special master the said Southern Railway Company shall fully possess and be invested with all of the estate, right, title, and interest in, to, and of such railroad, equipment, property, and franchises so sold under the decree of this court as the absolute owner thereof, to have and to hold the same to it and its successors and assigns forever.\n\n'On August 31, 1894, on exhibition of the deed executed and delivered by the special master herein ordered, the defendant company is authorized, directed, and required forthwith to deliver over to the said Southern Railway Company the possession of all and singular the railroad and property described in and conveyed by such deed.\n\n'It is also further ordered that by way of further assurance and confirmation of title to such Southern Railway Company of the property so by it purchased under the decree of this court, the said The Western North Carolina Railroad Company, by its proper officers and under its corporate seal, and the Central Trust Company of New York, trustee, shall, upon request of said Southern Railway Company, sign, seal, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to said Southern Railway Company all proper deeds of conveyance, transfer, release, and further assurance of all the railroad property and franchises so as aforesaid sold under the decree of this court and embraced in the deed of the special master, so as fully and completely to transfer to, and invest in, the said Southern Railway Company the full legal and equitable title to all such railroad property and franchises sold or intended to be sold under the decree of this court.'\n\n Afterwards the master conveyed to the Southern Railway Company--\n'All and singular the railroad of the said Western North Carolina Railroad Company in the state of North Carolina, extending from Salisbury, in Rowan county, to and through Statesville, in Iredell county, to Asheville, on or near the \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 96]\n\u00a0\n French Broad river Broad river to Paint Rock in Madison county, Broad river to Paint Rock in Madison county, and also from said Asheville westward to the Tennessee river at or near the mouth of the Nantahala river, and thence westward to Murphy in Cherokee county; and all real estate now owned or acquired for the purpose of said railroad, including all station, depot, or other grounds held and used in connection therewith; and all rails, railway tracks, sidings, switches, bridges, fences, turn- tables, water tanks, viaducts, culverts, superstructures passenger and other depots, station and freight houses, machine shops, buildings, fixtures, rolling stock, equipment, machinery, tools and implements whatsoever, now owned or acquired for the purposes or business of the said Western North Carolina Railroad Company in connection with the said railroad, and all the franchises, rights, privileges, easements, income, earnings, and profits of the said Western North Carolina Railroad Company, connected with, issuing from, or relating to, the said above-described railroad.\n\n'The foregoing properties-real, personal, choses in action, and franchises-being embraced in the lien of the second mortgage of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, executed September 2, 1884, and being sold in foreclosure of the same.\n\n'A more full and particular description of the property intended to be conveyed by this instrument being contained in said decree of the 5th of May, 1894, to which reference is hereby made, together with all the corporate estate, equity of redemption, rights, privileges, immunities, and franchises of said Western North Carolina Railroad Company, and all the tolls, fares freights, rents, income, issues, and profits of the said railroad, and all interests and claims and demands of every nature and description, and all the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders thereof, including all the said mortgaged premises and property in said decree directed to be sold, at any time owned or acquired by, and now in the possession of, said Western North Carolina Railroad Company.'\n\n The deed of purchase was duly recorded, and in August, 1894, the purchaser took possession of the railroad property \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 97]\n\u00a0\n and has ever since been in possession of the road, operating it as owner.\n On March 20, 1897, Mrs. James, as administratrix of her deceased husband, W. A. James, brought an action in the superior court of Rowan county, North Carolina, against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company for damages for the wrongful killing of her husband. The Southern Railway Company was the employer of the deceased and he was killed in its service while acting as a locomotive engineer. In the trial court a judgment was rendered in favor of the railroad company. On appeal the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded to the superior court, with directions to enter a judgment for the damages assessed in favor of the administratrix. James v. Western N. C. R. Co. 121 N. C. 523, 46 L. R. A. 306, 28 S. E. 537. Judgment was entered accordingly against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company for $15,000 on February 21, 1898\n\n\n On the same day that the James suit was begun, March 20, 1897, Fannie E. Howard, as administratrix of her husband, John H. A. Howard, deceased, commenced an action in the superior court to recover of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company damages sustained in the death, by wrongful act, of her husband, who was killed at the same time with James, being a fireman in the employ of the Southern Railway Company, and recovered damages in the sum of $5,000 on February 21, 1898. To neither of these suits was the Southern Railway Company made a party defendant. After the recovery of these judgments, Mrs. James and Mrs. Howard caused executions to be issued from the superior court of Rowan county, and placed the same in the hands of D. R. Julian, sheriff, who proceeded to levy the same upon the property as belonging to the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, to wit:\n'The Western North Carolina Railroad Company, existing in the state of North Carolina, including its corporate franchises, rights, privileges, immunities, easements, and appurtenances of every kind appertaining, belonging to, or in any wise connected therewith, or issuing out of and relating to the said The Western North Carolina Railroad Company, together \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 98]\n\u00a0\n with all of its property in the state of North Carolina, and including its roadbed and right of way, its real estate acquired and owned for railroad purposes, its stations, depots, grounds, its railway tracks, switches, sidings, bridges, fences, turn-tables, water tanks, viaducts, culverts, superstructures, passenger, freight, and other houses, machine shops, buildings, and fixtures,-the said railroad extending from the town of Salisbury through Statesville, Newtown, Hickory, Morganton, Marian, Asheville to Paint Rock in Madison county, and from Asheville westward by way of Waynesville to Murphy in Cherokee county,-reference being had for a further description of said road and its property, rights, and franchises to the charter of the said road and the amendments thereto enacted from time to time by the general assembly of North Carolina.'\n\n The sheriff advertised the property levied upon for sale, whereupon the Central Trust Company of New York and the Southern Railway Company filed a supplemental bill in the foreclosure proceeding, making the sheriff party defendant, seeking to quiet the title to the property and franchise purchased at the foreclosure sale and to enjoin the sale of the same to satisfy the judgments rendered in the state courts against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company. In the answer of the sheriff and of the administratrices of James and Howard, issue was taken upon the right of the circuit court to entertain the bill or grant an injunction, and among other things it was averred:\n'3. That these respondents deny the truth of the allegations contained in the 3d section of the supplemental bill of complaint, and while they admit that the Southern Railway Company took a deed from the master purporting to convey the said franchises and property subject to the lien of the first-mortgage bonds theretofore issued by the said company, they aver that the Southern Railway Company, being at the time of said sale not a resident corporation of the state of north Carolina, and not subject to visitation of said state, but attempting to do business therein by comity, was not allowed or authorized by the laws of North Carolina to purchase, or hold, or operate the Western North Carolina Railroad, or to own its \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 99]\n\u00a0\n franchise and property without becoming a domestic corporation, and that, by virtue of certain laws enacted by the legislature of North Carolina at its session of 1879, being chapter 10 of the Laws of 1879, re-enacted in the Code of North Carolina as  1255, no mortgage of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, thereafter issued, had the legal effect of exempting the property or earnings of said company from execution for the satisfaction of any judgment obtained in the courts of said state against said company for torts thereafter committed by said company, its agents, or employees, whereby any person should be killed, or any person or property injured, 'any clause or clauses in such mortgage to the contrary notwithstanding,' both the first mortgage bonds subject to which the sale of the franchise and property of said company purporting, under the decree referred to in the bill of complaint to have been sold, and the second mortgage bonds, for default in payment of the interest on which the decree of foreclosure was entered, appear from said record (Exhibit A to said bill of complaint) to have been issued long after the enactment of said statute in the year 1871, and said statute, since its enactment in 1871, has been the law of the state of North Carolina, in contemplation of which all railroad companies created by, and organized under, the laws of said state, have issued all mortgage bonds, the said statute, as these respondents are advised, informed, and believe, having entered into and formed a part of every mortgage bond issued by any railroad corporation operating under the laws of North Carolina since its enactment in 1871.\n\n'But these respondents deny the truth of the allegation 'that, at the time of their death (referring to the death of W. A. James and John H. A. Howard) the Western North Carolina Railroad Company had no interest in the Western North Carolina Railroad, or the franchises, nor had it any interest or estate in said railroad or franchise of any kind or nature whatsoever since the 22d day of August, 1894, the day the Southern Railway Company took possession of said railroad;' and these respondents aver that the supreme court of North Carolina, the highest appellate court of said state, held and adjudged, \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 100]\n\u00a0\n in the year A. D. 1898, in actions pending therein on appeal, and in which these respondents, respectively, were plaintiffs, and the said The Western North Carolina Railroad Company was defendant, that the said Western North Carolina Railroad Company was still an existing corporation, liable to be sued in the courts of said state, and that the said judgments in favor of these respondents, respectively, and against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, constituted liens upon the franchise and property of the company, superior to the liens of the said first mortgage bonds or the said second mortgage bonds mentioned in the said foreclosure suit, and these respondents are advised, informed, and believe that the courts of the United States are bound to follow and adopt the construction given by the highest appellate court of North Carolina in construing its own Constitution and its own laws. And these respondents are advised, informed, and believe that, though the Southern Railway Company had assumed the right to operate the Western North Carolina Railroad, and had employed the intestates of these respondents as engineer and fireman, when they were killed by the negligence of said Southern Railway Company, that the supreme court of North Carolina had held and adjudged in the said actions brought by these respondents against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, and wherein they recovered the judgments in pursuance of which executions have issued, as alleged in the bill of complaint, that the said The Western North Carolina Railroad Company was answerable for the torts of the Southern Railway Company, and for any damages to its employees the Central Trust Company and the Southern Railway Company in operating said railroad.'\n\n Upon hearing upon the bill, answer, and testimony, a decree was entered in favor of the Central Trust Company and the Southern Railway Company, and an injunction granted against the proposed sale of the property levied upon. From this decree an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals, from whose judgment affirming the decree of the circuit court (53 C. C. A. 438, 115 Fed. 956) a writ of certiorari to this court was granted. \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 101]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lee S. Overman, A. C. Avery, B. F. Long, and C. A. Mountjoy for petitioners.\n Messrs. Charles Price, F. H. Busbee, and William A. Henderson for respondents.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The title of the Southern Railway Company to the franchise and property of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company would seem to be plain, unless there is something in the North Carolina statutes or judicial determinations which prevents the foreclosure proceedings from having effect to pass the title. A railroad company in North Carolina has full authority to mortgage its franchises and property. N. C. Code,  1957. This power was also given by the charter of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company. By the foreclosure proceedings, the title of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company to its franchise and property, except its mere right to be a corporation, was sold and the title confirmed in the purchaser. By the law of North Carolina the title to mortgaged premises is in the mortgagee. The Central Trust Company, the trustee under the first and second mortgages, was a party to the foreclosure proceedings. It is estopped to dispute the effect of the decree, sale, and confirmation, clothing the Southern Railway Company with the full title to the property and franchise to operate a railroad which had theretofore belonged to the Western North Carolina Railroad Company. From this record and a consideration of the litigation that has arisen in the attempt to collect the James and Howard judgments, it is evident that a conflict exists between the views of the Federal courts and the supreme court of North Carolina as to the effect of the foreclosure proceedings to relieve the property purchased at the sale from levy and execution to satisfy the James and Howard judgments. Such differences, always to be deprecated, should be approached \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 102]\n\u00a0\n in a spirit of fairness and comity, with a view to preventing conflicts of jurisdiction detrimental to the rights of parties and to the respect and authority due judicial tribunals. The decision relied upon as justifying the sheriff in the levy of execution and sale of the property formerly belonging to the Western North Carolina Railroad Company is James v. Western N. C. R. Co. reported in 121 N. C. 523, 46 L. R. A. 306, 28 S. E. 537, in which case it was held that the sale of the railroad company's property upon the foreclosure of the second mortgage did not extinguish the corporate existence of the company nor release it from liability to the public for the manner in which the property was operated. Further, that the sale under the decree in the circuit court of the United States foreclosing the second mortgage did not, under  697, 698 of the Code of North Carolina, make the purchaser a domestic corporation, and that, in order to have the effect to dissolve the mortgagor corporation as provided in  697 of the Code, another corporation must be provided, as contemplated in  1936 of the Code, to take its place and to assume and discharge the obligations to the public growing out of the franchise, and until that is done the old corporation will continue to exist. Speaking of  697 and 698 of the North Carolina Code, the learned judge, delivering the opinion, said:\n'These sections were passed in 1872, and we think should be considered in connection with  701, which was passed in 1879, and  1936 and 2005 referred to in  701.\n\n'If this be the correct reading of these sections of the Code, it would seem that while  697 does say that these facts, ipso facto, dissolved the corporation, another corporation must be provided, as in  1936 of the Code, to take its place before it is dissolved; that there must always be a corporation in existence liable to the public for the duties and obligations assumed by the grantee for the privileges conferred in the grant of the franchise and that the old corporation must continue to exist until this is done; and that when the new corporation is formed it will be a domestic corporation. It cannot be that the legislature ever intended, by this general legislation, to create a foreign corporation here, when it could \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 103]\n\u00a0\n not do so by positive and direct enactment. 119 N. C. 918; 78 Fed. 387, Judge Dick's opinion in Bradley v. Ohio River & C. R. Co. published in the appendix. By this view of the case all the interests of the parties may be harmonized. The 'Southern,' the purchaser of the equity of redemption of the 'Western,' stands in the shoes of that company. The Southern is in effect the mortgagor in its relations to the 'Central Trust Company of New York,' the mortgagee of the first mortgage, and being in possession of the road, its property and franchise, has the right to run and operate the same. But the old corporation, still in existence, is liable for damages caused by the maladministration of the Southern, which it allows to run and operate the road. But the property of this road, which the 'Southern' is allowed to use, will be held liable to the public for damages. Chollette v. Omaha & R. Valley R. Co. 26 Neb. 159, 4 L. R. A. 135, 41 N. W. 1106; Brunswick Gaslight Co. v. United States Gas, Fuel, & Light Co. 35 Am. St. Rep. 385, and note on page 390 (85 Me. 532, 27 Atl. 525).\n\n'It therefore follows that, in our opinion, the court below erred in its ruling upon the third issue. This ruling is reversed, and judgment should be entered for the plaintiff according to the verdict of the jury.' James v. Western N. C. R. Co. 121 N. C. 523-528, 529, 46 L. R. A. 306, 310, 311, 28 S. E. 537, 538, 539.\n\n This decision of the highest court of the state was made after the rights of the Southern Railway Company, whatever they may be, had accrued in the property and franchise of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, and, while entitled to the highest respect and consideration, is not conclusive upon this court in determining the rights secured to the purchaser under the decree of foreclosure in the Federal court. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 27 L. ed. 359, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10.\n If the North Carolina supreme court can be taken to have held that the property purchased by the Southern Railway Company at the judicial sale continued liable for debts thereafter accruing against the Western North Carolina Railroad Company we are constrained to dissent from such conclusion. Under  697, North Carolina Code, it is provided that the sale under a deed of trust or mortgage shall pass not only the works and property of a corporation and those acquired \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 104]\n\u00a0\n after the mortgage and before the sale, but all other property of which it may be possessed at the time of the sale other than debts due it, and 'upon such conveyance to the purchaser the said corporation shall, ipso facto, be dissolved, and the said purchaser shall forthwith be a new corporation by any name which may be set forth in the said conveyance, or in any writing signed by him, and recorded in the same manner in which the conveyance shall be recorded.' Section 698 provides that the corporation created by or in consequence of such sale and conveyance shall succeed to all such franchises, rights, and privileges, and perform all such duties as would have been or should have been performed by the first corporation but for such sale and conveyance, save only that the corporation so created shall not be entitled to the debts due to the first corporation, and shall not be liable for any debts or claims against the first corporation which may not be expressly assumed in the contract of purchase; nor shall the property, franchise, or profits of such new corporation be exempt from taxation. This, with other provisions of  668, indicate an intention to clothe the purchaser with all the property of the old corporation, including the franchise to conduct and operate a railroad, freed from all debts or obligations of the old corporation.\n But these sections, it is said in the James Case, must be read in connection with  701 and  1936 and 2005, referred to in  701. They are set forth in the margin.* \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 105]\n\u00a0\n And it is said, as the result of these provisions, that, unless the purchaser shall organize a new domestic corporation to take the place of the old corporation, the property continues liable, though in the hands of the purchaser, upon a cause of action asserted against the old corporation for the conduct of the new owner, and this in actions to which the purchaser is not a party, and whose knowledge of the suit and judgment may come with the seizure of the property to satisfy the judgment. For, it is said, 'there must always be a corporation in existence liable to the public for the duties and liabilities assumed by the grantee for the privileges conferred in the grant of the franchise.' This reasoning, it seems to us, assumes that the franchise to operate the road did not pass by the sale, \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 106]\n\u00a0\n unless such new domestic corporation is organized. As we have seen, the North Carolina statutes authorize the conveyance by mortgage of the property and the franchise to use and operate it. The decree of foreclosure undertakes to sell, and the confirmation to secure the purchaser in the use and enjoyment of, the property. The power given to mortgage the franchise of the corporation must necessarily include the power to bring it to sale with the property to make the sale effectual as a means of transferring the right to use the thing conveyed. New Orleans, S. F. & L. R. Co. v. Delamore, \n114 U.S. 501\n, 29 L. ed. 244, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1009.\n It is true the right to be a corporation is not sold. By the statute the corporation is declared to be dissolved by the sale, and under other sections of the North Carolina Code its affairs are to be wound up. But the franchise to operate and use the property has passed at the sale, and must have done so to make the purchase of any value. This principle, recognizing the distinction between the mere right or franchise to be a corporation and the franchise of maintaining and operating the railroad, was distinctly pointed out by Mr. Justice Matthews in Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Commissioners, \n112 U.S. 619\n, 28 L. ed. 841, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303:\n'The franchise of being a corporation need not be implied as necessary to secure to the mortgage bondholders or the purchasers at a foreclosure sale, the substantial rights intended to be secured. They acquire the ownership of the railroad and the property incident to it, and the franchise of maintaining and operating it as such; and the corporate existence is not essential to its use and enjoyment. All the franchises necessary or important to the beneficial use of the railroad could as well be exercised by natural persons. The essential properties of corporate existence are quite distinct from the franchises of the corporation. The franchise of being a corporation belongs to the corporators,while the powers and privileges vested in and to be exercised by the corporate body as such, are the franchises of the corporation. The latter has no power to dispose of the franchise of its members, which may survive in the mere fact of corporate existence, after the corporation has parted with all its property and all its franchises.' \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 107]\n\u00a0\n It is true the sections of the North Carolina Code herewith given clothe the purchaser with the right and privilege of organizing a corporation to operate the purchased property, but we find no requirement that he shall do so. The language of the last paragraph of  1936 is 'such purchaser or purchasers may associate with him or them any number of persons, and make and acknowledge and file articles of association as prescribed in this chapter; such purchaser or purchasers and their associates shall thereupon be a new corporation, with all the powers, privileges, and franchise, and be subject to all the provisions of this chapter.' This confers a privilege, but does not prevent the purchaser from transferring the property to a company already formed and authorized to purchase and operate a railroad. People v. Brooklyn, F. & C. I. R. Co. 89 N. Y. 75.\n\n The Southern Railway Company was authorized by its charter, among other things, to purchase or otherwise acquire the property of any railroad company organized under the laws of another state. We have been cited to no statute of the state of North Carolina forbidding the purchase of a railroad at foreclosure sale by a corporation of another state. It is said that the state requires a domestic corporation organized under, and subject to, its laws to become the purchaser of a railroad under the North Carolina statutes already cited. But the Southern Railway Company, in purchasing a franchise granted by the state of North Carolina, and undertaking to operate a railroad within the state, is subject to regulation by the law of the state. Runyan v. Coster, 14 Pet. 122, 10 L. ed. 382; American & Foreign Christian Union v. Yount, \n101 U.S. 352\n-354, 25 L. ed. 888-890. This principle is not qualified because the right of removal of suits for diverse citizenship still exists, as was held in Southern R. Co. v. Allison, \n190 U.S. 326\n, 47 L. ed. 1078, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 713. It is urged that the supreme court of North Carolina, by a course of decisions antedating the mortgage and foreclosure, had established the rule of law contended for as to the continuing liability of a railroad corporation unless a domestic corporation is organized to own and operate the property. We have examined these cases and do not find such to be the ease. The supreme court of North Carolina had held a lessor liable for the conduct and management \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 108]\n\u00a0\n of the lessee, and in Pierce v. North Carolina R. Co. 124 N. C. 83, 44 L. R. A. 316, 32 S. E. 399, decided in March, 1899, that court said:\n'The motion to dismiss the complaint and for judgment of nonsuit appears from brief of defendants' counsel to be intended to raise again the question whether the lessor company, The North Carolina Railroad Company, the defendant herein, is liable 'for all acts done by the lessee in the operation of the road,' as was held in Logan v. North Carolina R. Co. 116 N. C. 940, 21 S. E. 959, but why the counsel should feel 'encouraged to believe' that this court will retire from the position it has taken upon the question, we are not advised. We have perceived no lack of 'soundness of reasoning' therein. The decision in Logan's Case was made after full deliberation and with full appreciation and careful discussion of the important principle now again called in question, and it was held that 'a railroad company cannot escape its responsibility for negligence by leasing its road to another company, unless its charter or a subsequent act of the legislature specially exempts it from liability in such case,' and it was made in an action to which the appellant herein was the party raising the question. The same proposition had been theretofore laid down by Smith, C. J., in Aycock v. Raleigh & A. Air Line R. Co. 89 N. C. at page 330, with cases there cited, and Logan's Case upon this point has been expressly cited and sustained in Tillett v. Norfolk & W. R. Co. 118 N. C. at page 1043, 24 S. E. 113; James v. Western N. C. R. Co. 121 N. C. at page 528, 46 L. R. A. 310, 28 S. E. 538; Benton v. North Carolina R. Co. 122 N. C. 1007, 30 S. E. 333, and Norton v. Carolina C. R. Co. 122 N. C. at pages 936, 937, 29 S. E. 894. In the last two cases this point was again held against the same corporation, which is the appellant in this case; the verdicts were for considerable sums, and in Norton's Case the defendant was represented by the same counsel as in the present case.'\n\n But this is far from holding that in the case of a sale the corporate property shall remain liable for the debts of the old corporation in suits against it until a new domestic corporation is organized to take the place of the old one. The cases cited hold the lessor to a continued liability, notwithstanding a lease. In the case in hand the property and franchise have been sold, \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 109]\n\u00a0\n and there is no contractual relation between the companies nor permissive operation of the road by the new company.\n Nor can we see any room for the application of  1255 of the North Carolina Code, making liens for judgments for torts superior to mortgages of incorporated companies. In this case the tort was committed after the judgment debtor had parted with all its property and there was nothing for such judgment to operate upon. Jeffrey v. Moran, \n101 U.S. 286\n, 25 L. ed. 786.\n Objection is made to the right of the corporation to maintain this bill. To determine this question reference must be had to the attitude of the parties and the nature of the remedy sought. By the decree of the circuit court all the property of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company was ordered to be sold, and was conveyed and confirmed to the purchaser, the Southern Railway Company; it was placed in possession of the property and has operated it ever since. The judgments in controversy were obtained for acts committed more than two years after the confirmation of the sale and were rendered about four years after the court adjudicated a sale of all the property of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company. To these actions the Southern Railway Company was not a party, yet it is sought to levy upon and sell the very property conveyed to it by the decree of the Federal court, and this upon the theory set up in the answer herein that the property is still liable for the debts of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company because of the failure to organize a domestic corporation to take its place after the sale. The return of the sheriff shows that he has levied upon all this property, said to be of the value of five millions of dollars, to pay these judgments of twenty thousand dollars.\n It is not claimed that the Western North Carolina Railroad Company acquired the property by any new title, but in effect it is sought to annul the order and decree of the Federal court because it has not operated to transfer the title to the purchaser. Examining the decree under which this property was sold, we find certain provisions which are important in this connection. It is provided: \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 110]\n\u00a0\n 'The purchaser or purchasers at said sale shall, as part of the consideration for such sale, take the property purchased upon the express condition that he or they, or his or their assigns approved by the court, will pay off and satisfy any and all claims filed in this cause, but only when the court shall allow such claims and adjudge the same to be prior in lien to the mortgage foreclosed in this suit, and in accordance with the order or orders of the court allowing such claims and adjudging with respect thereto, and the purchaser or purchasers, or their approved assigns, shall be entitled to appeal from any and all orders or decrees of the court in respect to such claims or any of them, and shall have all the right in respect to such appeals which the complainant Central Trust Company of New York would have in case such appeals had been taken by it. The purchaser or purchasers at said sale shall also, as part of the consideration, in addition to the payment of the sum or sums bid, take the property purchased upon the express condition that he or they, or his or their assigns approved by the court, will pay off and satisfy all debts or obligations incurred or to be incurred by the receivers having possession of such property which have not been, or shall not be paid by said receivers, and which shall be adjudged by the court to be debts or obligations properly chargeable against the property purchased, and to be prior or superior to the lien of the mortgage foreclosed in this suit.\n'The court reserves the right to retake and resell said property in case of the failure or neglect of purchaser or purchasers, or his or their assigns approved by the court as aforesaid, to comply with any order of the court in respect to payment of prior lien claims above mentioned within twenty days after service of a copy of such order upon said purchaser or purchasers, or his or their assigns,'\n\n And in the decree affirming the sale we find:\n'Thereupon the court orders and decrees that the said report of the special master be spread at large upon the record, and be in all things approved, and the sale made by him to the said Southern Railway Company, being all and singular the railroad, equipment, property, and franchises of the Western \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 111]\n\u00a0\n North Carolina Railroad Company as described in and by the decree of foreclosure entered in this cause on May 5, 1894, at and for the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) by it bid, be and the same is in all things ratified, approved, confirmed, and made absolute, subject, however, to all the mortgages, receivers' debts and preferential claims, and to all equities reserved, and to all and singular the conditions of purchase as recited in said decree, and the continued right of the court to adjudge and declare what receivers' or corporate debts are prior in lien or in equity to the lien of the mortgage herein foreclosed, or ought to be paid out of such proceeds of sale in preference to the bonds secured thereby. And this court expressly reserves for future adjudication, and power thereby to bind the property sold, all liens and claims and equities specified in, and reserved by, the said final decree of foreclosure so as aforesaid entered on May 5, 1894.\n\n'And the court accepts the said Southern Railway Company as the purchaser of all and singular the railroad property and franchises sold under the decree in this cause, and holds it obligated as such purchaser to complete and fully pay its said bid and to comply with all the orders of the court heretofore entered, or hereafter from time to time to be entered by it obligatory on such purchaser. And the court reserves full power, notwithstanding such conveyance and delivery of possession, to retake and resell the property this day confirmed to such purchaser, if it fails or neglects fully to complete such purchase and comply with the orders of court in respect to the full payment and performance of its bid, or to pay into court in accordance with such decree of sale all such sums of money hereafter ordered by the court to be paid into its registry to discharge any and all such debts, liens, or claims as it may decree ought to be paid out of the proceeds of sale in preference to the mortgage of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company herein foreclosed.'\n\n It is obvious that by this decree of sale and confirmation it was the intention and purpose of the Federal court to retain jurisdiction over the cause so far as was necessary to determine all liens and demands to be paid by the purchaser. It accepted \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 112]\n\u00a0\n the purchaser and thereby made it a party to the suit. Blossom v. Milwaukee & C. R. Co. 1 Wall. 655, 17 L. ed. 673. The court reserved the right to retake the property if necessary to enforce any lien that might be adjudged against the same. On the other hand, the purchaser agreed to pay only such demands as the circuit court might declare and adjudge to be legally due, with the right of appeal from such judgment. These provisions make apparent the purpose of the court to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of itself settling and determining all liens and demands which the purchaser should pay as a condition of security in the title which the court had decreed to be conveyed. If the sheriff is allowed to sell the very property conveyed by the Federal decree, such action has the effect to annul and set it aside, because, in the view of the state court, it was ineffectual to pass the title to the purchaser. In such case we are of opinion that a supplemental bill may be filed in the original suit with a view to protecting the prior jurisdiction of the Federal court and to render effectual its decree. Central Trust Co. v. St. Louis, A. & T. R. Co. 59 Fed. 385; Fidelity Ins. Trust & S. D. Co. v. Norfolk & W. R. Co. 88 Fed. 815; State Trust Co. v. Kansas City, P. & G. R. Co. 110 Fed. 10.\n In such cases, where the Federal court acts in aid of its own jurisdiction and to render its decree effectual, it may, notwithstanding  720, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581), restrain all proceedings in a state court which would have the effect of defeating or impairing its jurisdiction. Sharon v. Terry, 13 Sawy. 387, 1 L. R. A. 572, 36 Fed. 337, per Mr. Justice Field; French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 22 L. ed. 857; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 U.S. 494\n, 26 L. ed. 497.\n Nor is it an answer to say that these judgments were for causes of action arising subsequent to the confirmation of sale. The Federal court by its decree reserved the right to determine what liens or claims should be charged upon the title conveyed by the court, and by the levy and sale to pay these judgments the title is charged with other liens, established in another court, in a proceeding to which the purchaser was not a party. The Federal court, in protecting the purchaser \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 113]\n\u00a0\n under such circumstances, was acting in pursuance of the jurisdiction acquired when the foreclosure proceedings were begun.\n In Re Farmers' Loan & T. Co. (original) \n129 U.S. 206\n-213, 32 L. ed. 656, 657, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, 266, Mr. Justice Miller said: 'But the doctrine that, after a decree which disposes of a principal subject of litigation and settles the rights of the parties in regard to that matter, there may subsequently arise important matters requiring the judicial action of the court in relation to the same property and some of the same rights litigated in the main suit, making necessary substantive and important orders and decrees in which the most material rights of the parties may be passed upon by the court, and which, when they partake of the nature of final decisions of those rights, may be appealed from, is well established by the decisions of this court.'\n We think this case belongs to the class instanced by the learned justice, and that the circuit court, by the order made, retained jurisdiction of the case to settle all claims against the property and to determine what burdens should be borne by the purchaser as a condition of holding the title conveyed. In such cases the jurisdiction of the court may be invoked by supplemental bill or bill in the nature of a supplemental bill, irrespective of the citizenship of the parties. Freeman v. Howe, 16 L. ed. 749-752, 24 How. 450-460. The authorities are collected in a note to  97, vol. 1, of Bates on Federal Equity Procedure, and the doctrine thus summarized: 'It would seem that the prevention of a conflict of authority between the state and Federal courts, and the protection and preservation of the jurisdiction of each, free from encroachments by the other, are considerations which lie at the very foundation of ancillary jurisdiction. A bill filed to continue a former litigation in the same court, or which relates to some matter already partly litigated in the same court, or which is an addition to a former litigation in the same court, by the same parties or their representatives standing in the same interest, or to obtain and secure the fruits, benefits, and advantages of the proceedings and judgment in a former suit in the same court by the same or additional parties, standing in the same interest, or to prevent a party from using the proceedings and judgment \n\n[193 U.S. 93, 114]\n\u00a0\n of the same court for fraudulent purposes, or to restrain a party from using a judgment to perpetrate an injustice, or obtain an inequitable advantage over other parties to the former judgment or proceeding, or to obtain any equitable relief in regard to, or connected with, or growing out of, any judgment or proceeding at law rendered in the same court, or to assert any claim, right, or title to property in the custody of the court, or for the defense of any property rights, or the collection of assets of any estate being administered by the court,-is an ancillary suit.'\n While recognizing the weight which should be given to decisions of the supreme court of a state in construing its own laws, and being disposed to follow them and accept the conclusions reached in construing local statutes in every case of doubt, we are here dealing with a right and title conferred by authority of the decree of a Federal court, which may be virtually set aside and held for naught if the property awarded can be taken upon execution in suits to which the purchaser is not a party. It is conceded that the Federal right could be set up in the state court from which the execution issued, and, if denied, the ultimate rights of the parties can be determined upon writ of error to this court. In the view we have taken of this case the Federal court had not lost its jurisdiction to protect the purchaser at its sale upon direct proceedings such as are now before us.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the same is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Sec. 701.

TREDWAY(1904)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 24, 1904Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n On August 20, 1898, Gustave Kaufman filed his petition in bankruptcy and was subsequently adjudged and decreed a bankrupt. W. T. Tredway was appointed trustee of his estate. On July 24, 1899, the trustee commenced suit in the court of common pleas, No. 3, of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, to recover from Joseph S. Kaufman the sum of $4,086.64, charged to have been given, on August 4, 1898, by the bankrupt to the defendant as a preference. The trial resulted in a judgment in favor of the trustee for $1,086.64 and interest. This judgment was affirmed on appeal by the superior court. An application for a further appeal to the supreme court of the state was denied, and thereupon this writ of error was sued out to review the judgment of the superior court. Section 60 of the bankrupt act is as follows:\n'Section 60. (a) A person shall be deemed to have given a preference if, being insolvent, he has procured or suffered a judgment to be entered against himself in favor of any person, or made a transfer of any of his property, and the effect of the* \n\n[195 U.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of such judgment or transfer will be to enable any one of his creditors to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of such creditors of the same class.\n\n'(b) If a bankrupt shall have given a preference within four months before the filing of a petition, or after the filing of the petition, and before the adjudication, and the person receiving it, or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall have had reasonable cause to believe that it was intended thereby to give a preference, it shall be viodable by the trustee, and he may recover the property or its value from such person.\n\n'(c) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterwards in good faith gives the debtor further credit, without security of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the debtor's estate, the amount of such new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be set off against the amount which would otherwise be recoverable from him.' 30 Stat. at L. 544, 562, chap. 541, July 1, 1898, U.

Hedrick v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. \n167 \nU.S. 673, 677\n, 42 S. L. ed. 320, 322, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 922; E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. \n186 \nU.S. 70, 83\n, 46 S.

It is suggested that the trial court erred in admitting testimony of transactions between the brothers some six or seven months prior to the payment by the bankrupt to the defendant; that such transactions were too remote from the time of the preference to throw light on the question of knowledge. We think that the testimony, whether of much or little value, was competent, and that it was not error for the court to admit it. Clune v. United States, \n159 U.S. 590\n- 592, 40 L. ed. 269, 270, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 125.\n We see no reason to doubt the propriety of allowing interest on the claim from the commencement of the action. Such commencement is itself a demand.\n The principal contention, however, is that the state court erred in ruling that the sum of $767, loaned by the defendant to the bankrupt on August 8, could not be considered as a set-off. If appeared that four days after he had received the money paid to him in preference the defendant handed to the bankrupt $767, on the latter's request for money to pay his employees. There was no testimony tending to show what became of this money, whether it was used in paying employees, or whether the payments, if made, were for wages earned within three months before the date of the commencement of proceedings in bakruptcy. All that appeared was the fact of the loan and the expressed purpose thereof. Under these circumstances the court instructed the jury that the defendant had not established his claim to a set-off, as author- \n\n[195 U.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n ized by paragraph c of  60. This presents a distinct question of law.\n The trial court, and its views were approved by the superior court, held that the statute required not merely that the creditor in good faith gave the debtor credit without security, and that the money or property in fact passed to the debtor, and became a part of his estate, but also that it remained such until the time of the bankruptcy, and was transferred to the trustee; or, at least, that it was used in payment of preferred debts. In its opinion, on a motion for a new trial, it said:\n'Evidence that the debtor got the money for another purpose certainly is not evidence that he turned it over to the trustee.\n\n'The most that defendant can ask-and this we would probably hold-is that money shown to have been given and used to pay a preferred debt would entitle the defendant to a set-off.'\n\n It will be noticed that the words used in paragraph c are not 'the bankrupt's estate,' but 'the debtor's estate.' 'Debtor' is also found in the preceding clause as descriptive of the one to whom the credit is given. While the same person is both debtor and bankrupt, first debtor and then bankrupt, the use of the former term is suggestive of the time of the transaction as well as the status of the recipient of the credit. The paragraph further provides that 'the amount of such new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be set off.' It is the nonpayment, and not the fact that the property remains still a part of the debtor's estate, which entitles to a set-off. It would seem that if Congress intended that which the trial court held to be the meaning of the statute, it would have said 'which becomes a part of the bankrupt's estate' or 'which becomes and remains a part of the debtor's estate until the adjudication in bankruptcy.'\n Further, Congress provided that the creditor act in good faith. Thus it excluded any arrangement by which the cred- \n\n[195 U.S. 271, 275]\n\u00a0\n itor, seeking to escape the liability occasioned by the preference he has received, passes money or property over to the debtor with a view to its secretion until after the bankruptcy proceedings have terminated, or with some other wrongful purpose. It meant that the creditor should not act in such a way as to intentionally defeat the bankrupt act, but should let the debtor have the money or property for some honest purpose. Requiring that it should become a part of the debtor's estate excluded cases in which the creditor delivered the property to a third person on the credit of the debtor, or delivered it to him with instructions to pass it on to some third party. The purpose was that the property which passed from the creditor should in fact become a part of the debtor's estate, and that the credit should be only for such property.\n Still again, to require that the creditor should not only in good faith have extended the credit, and that the money or property should have passed into, and become a part of, the debtor's estate, but that he should also show the actual disposition thereof made by the debtor, would, in many cases, practically deny the creditor the benefit of a credit which he has extended in good faith. Suppose, three months and a half before bankruptcy, the creditor, in good faith, sells and delivers a bill of goods to the debtor, a merchant; how difficult it would be to show what had become of each particular article on that bill, or what was done with the money received for those that had been sold; and the same when, as in this case, money was delivered to the debtor. If Congress had intended to require such proof it would seem that it would have used language more definite and certain. If the creditor has acted in good faith, extended credit without security, and the money or property has actually passed into the debtor's possession, why should anything more be required? Has the creditor not been already sufficiently punished when, having received money or property in payment of a just debt, he is compelled to refund that to the trustee because he believed, or had reason to believe, that the debtor, in paying that debt, preferred him? \n\n[195 U.S. 271, 276]\n\u00a0\n Why should he be punished in addition by the loss of the benefit of a credit given in good faith?\n We are of opinion that the state court erred in its construction of the statute and in peremptorily denying to the creditor the benefit of the credit. For these reasons the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEELY v. MOORE(1904)\nNo. 55\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[196 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. C. Cole, Hugh T. Taggart, and Leo Simmons for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. D. W. Baker and Wilton J. Lambert for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n This was an action of ejectment brought in the supreme court of the District by grantees of the heirs at law of William Thomson against Joseph H. Moore and the firm of Thomas J. Fisher & Company, agents of Mary Cecelia and Georgiana Hawkes Thomson, of the county of Kent, England, devisees under the will of William Thomson, to recover possession of an undivided ninety-one one hundredths of certain real estate in the city of Washington. Upon the trial it was admitted that William Thomson died in Southampton, England, in 1887, seised of the lot in question; that he was born in, and was a citizen of, the United States, leaving no issue or descendants. Plaintiffs had acquired the title of the heirs at alw, and the defendants were in possession of the lot as life tenants under his alleged will.\n The validity of the will and the due execution thereof were contested by the plaintiffs for reasons hereinafter indicated in the opinion. The trial resulted in a verdict for the defendants, upon which judgment was entered, and affirmed by the court of appeals. 22 App. D. C. 9. \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The validity of the will was attacked upon three grounds: 1st, that it has not the requisite number of witnesses to pass real estate in this District; 2d, that the testator was of unsound mind; 3d, that undue influence had been exercised by one of the designated executors, and others.\n Thomson was a resident of Washington, but, at the time of and for some years prior to his death was the American consul at Southampton, England. One John H. Cooksey, a resident merchant at Southampton, was his vice consul. The will was prepared by Walter R. Lomer, a resident solicitor, and was executed at his office February 24, 1866. By this will he devised the property in controversy to the appellees Mary Cecelia Thomson and Georgiana Hawkes Thomson, his cousins, of Kent county, England, jointly for their joint lives, and to the survivor of them, with remainder to Mary Cunningham Roberts, of London, for life, and remainder in fee to her only son. The will, which was executed in duplicate, was written upon two sheets of paper, to each of which the testator affixed his name. It was witnessed in the usual form by Lomer and by one Linthorne, a clerk in his office, who attached their signatures in the presence of and at the request of the testator, and in the presence of each other. On the day after the execution of the will Thomson again went to the office of his solicitor, Lomer, who wrote a certificate of acknowledgment in the margin of the second and last page of the will, which was signed by Cooksey, the vice consul.\n The original will, being of record in the Probate and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice in London, could not be produced, but was proved by a certificate and examined copy. The attestation clause and the certificate were as follows:\n Signed and acknowledged by the said William Thom- \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n son, the testator, as and for his last will and testament in the presence of us, both being present at the same time, who at his request in his presence, and in the presence of each other have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.\n Walter R. Lomer,\n Solicitor, Southampton, Eng.\n R. Roupe Linthorne,\n His Articled Clerk.\n I hereby certify that William Thomson, consul at Southampton for the United States of America, attended before me this 25th day of February, 1886, and acknowledged the foregoing paper-writing contained in two sheets of paper as his last will and testament and that the signature 'Wm. Thomson' at the foot thereof is in the proper handwriting of the said William Thomson.\n [Seal U. S. Consul.] John H. Cooksey,\n Vice Consul United States of America.\n The execution of the will was proved by the two subscribing witnesses, Lomer and Linthorne, and the certificate by proof of the death of Cooksey, and the genuineness of his signature. This was proper. Clarke v. Courtney, 5 Pet. 319, 8 L. ed. 140; Stebbins v. Duncan, \n108 U.S. 32\n, 27 L. ed. 641, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 313. At this time there was in force in this District the 5th section of the act of 29 Charles H., chapter 3, which had been adopted in Maryland in 1798, and carried into this District as  4, chapter 70, of the Compiled Statutes of 1894. It provided as follows: 'All devises and bequests of any lands or tenements, devisable by law, shall be in writing, and signed by the party so devising the same, or by some other person in his presence, and by his express directions, and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said devisor by three or four credible witnesses, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect.'\n The object of the certificate in question that Thomson took the will away with \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n him is not entirely clear, though from the fact after its execution, and stated that he would attend before the consul general at London and obtain the requisite certificate, it would seem that he thought the certificate was necessary to the proof of the will in another country. He did not go to London, however, but called again at Mr. Lomer's office, with the request that he prepare the requisite certificate, which he afterwards procured Mr. Cooksey to sign. The certificate was not offered as proof that the will was a copy of the original, since it was annexed to the original, and we can consider it only as proof as to what it contains. It certifies, in substance, that the testator attended before Cooksey upon the day following the date of the will, acknowledged it to be his last will and testament, and that the signature is genuine. Whether he intended to certify that Thomson acknowledged his signature to be genuine, or that he, Cooksey, certified that it was genuine, is somewhat uncertain; but if the words 'Vice Consul of the United States of America,' which are merely superfluous, were omitted, there would be no failure to comply with the statute, unless in the omission to certify that Cooksey, the certifying officer, 'attested and subscribed in the presence of the said devisor.' But as it appears that Thomson, not knowing when he would be in London, took the certificate to the vice consul, and that the latter signed it, the jury might properly draw the conclusion that it was signed in the testator's presence. This would be the usual course of business, and the presumption is that Cooksey conformed to it and to his duty as a certifying officer.\n The certificate was probably prepared under the belief that wills, like deeds, made in a foreign country, must be executed and acknowledged before some foreign official, or 'before any (some) secretary of legation or consular officer of the United States' (Rev. Stat.  1750; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1196; D. C. Comp. Stat. chap. 58,  6); but as such certificate was unofficial, and contributes nothing, as such, to the validity of the will, it can only be looked upon as the affirmation of an ordinary witness to the facts therein stated. No particular form of attestation was \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n necessary, as appears to be the case in England and in several of the United States; and if the certificate of Cooksey had been written at the foot of the will and signed by himself and by the two witnesses, Lomer and Linthorne, it would have been a sufficient attestation. How, then, can it be regarded as insufficient when an attestation in one form is signed by two witnesses and an attestation in another form by a third? Bearing in mind that the certificate, if given any force at all, must be considered an attestation, we do not think that the fact that it may have been written and signed under a mistaken impression as to its necessity and purpose vitiates it as an attestation. What use was intended to be made of it is immaterial, if it were useless for any purpose as an official certificate. The facts certified are appropriate to the attestation of the instrument, and, if true, we see no reason for holding it to be invalid as an attestation because it was signed under the impression that it was necessary for some possible purpose as a certificate.\n The case of Adams v. Norris, 23 How. 353, 16 L. ed. 539, is much in point. This was an action of ejectment for a parcel of land in California. Plaintiffs claimed through the heirs at law of one Grimes, defendants through the devisees in his will. The law required three witnesses to the validity of the will. Two of the witnesses signed in the usual manner, but above their signatures and beneath that of the testator was written: 'Before me, in the absence of the two alcaldes, Roberto T. Ridley, Sindico.' The sindico was counted among the witnesses, the court saying: 'We comprise among the witnesses to the will, Ridley, the sindico. It does not appear that a sindico was charged with any function in the preparation or execution of testaments by the law or custom of California. Nor is it clear that the sindico in the present instance expected to give any sanction to the instrument by his official character. He attests the execution of the will, and we cannot perceive why the description of himself, which he affixes to his signature, should detract from the efficacy of that attestation.' As it did no \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n appear that the sindico or the two alcaldes were charged with any special duties, it was practically held that the certificate of acknowledgment, and the official character of the sindico, might be disregarded, and the signature treated as an attestation.\n In the case of Clarke v. Turton, 11 Ves. jr. 240, the will was executed abroad. it appears that three witnesses were required, apparently under the same act of Charles II. as in this case. The third signature was, as in this case, that of the vice consul, whose attestation was considered necessary to the validity of the act. The case is insufficiently reported, but the court held that the attestation was a memorandum of the vice consul, to operate as a certificate, 'a separate act in his public character, and sealed with his official seal; and therefore it could not be said he subscribed as a witness.' The question upon that point was sent to law, but it does not appear what disposition was made of it. It appears, that the certificate was an official act, and treated as necessary, but the report fails to show what it contained, and, in the absence of such showing, the case is of little value.\n The applicability, and, to some extent, the authority, of this case, is somewhat weakened by that of Griffiths v. Griffiths, L. R. 2 Prob. & Div. 300. The will was signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses, who signed their names in his presence,-one opposite the word 'Executors' and the other opposite the word 'Witness.' There was no attestation clause to the will. The deceased intended one of the witnesses to be his executor, and asked him to sign his name in that character. Lord Penzance held that such person did not sign the will exclusively as executor, but that he also intended by his signature to affirm that the deceased executed the will in his presence, and that consequently the will was valid. Somewhat to the same effect is Pollock v. Glassell, 2 Gratt. 439.\n Conceding the general rule to be that witnesses must intend to attest the will as witnesses, the inference is strong that Cooksey did so in this case, as he certifies to the genuineness of the signature of Thomson and to the acknowledg- \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n ment of the will in his presence; and these are what would have been required by the law of this District had the instrument been a deed. It is argued that Cooksey did not intend to attest the will, but merely to sign the certificate; but the certificate of what? Only the fact that the will was acknowledged in his presence and that the signature was genuine. This is precisely the object of an attestation, and as an attestation we think it must be regarded. He may have supposed his official certificate of acknowledgment necessary to the execution of a will in a foreign country, but as he did certify personally to such acknowledgment the addition of his official title adds nothing to, and takes nothing from, the weight of his attestation. We must conclude that he intended to certify exactly what he did certify, and we are giving it exactly the effect he intended to give it.\n If the certificate were an official act and material as a separate acknowledgment of the execution of the will, as in the acknowledgment of a deed, the case would be different, since it has never been supposed that a notary, who takes an acknowledgment of a deed, could be counted as a witness to the deed without a separate signature. But here the certificate was a wholly unofficial act, and we see no objection to disregarding the words 'Vice Consul of the United States,' and treating it as an acknowledgment of the execution before a competent witness. The acknowledgment of a will is really a feature of the attestation. The statute did not require that the devisor should sign the will in the presence of the witness, but that the witness should sign in the presence of the testator.\n\n 2. \nThe evidence of Thomson's insanity was quite unsatisfactory. It appears that during the autumn or early winter of 1885 he was seized with an acute mania, and on December 15 was committed to a private insane asylum as a lunatic, upon the certificate of two physicians, and at the request of a cousin, named James E. Cunningham, a merchant of London, who appears to have taken temporary management of his affairs. He remained in the asylum about six weeks, and \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n on February 1, 1886, somewhat more than three weeks before he executed his will, was discharged as probably cured,-in reality granted a leave of absence on probation. The belief in his cure being justified by his subsequent conduct, a formal order of discharge was entered on the record of the asylum on June 26, 1886. Lomer and Linthorne, the witnesses who were present at the execution of the will, and Septimus Cooksey, the son of the vice consul, all testified to the mental capacity of the testator at that time.\n In this connection exception was taken to the exclusion of the application of James E. Cunningham for the admission of Thomson to the insane asylum, and of the certificate of the two physicians as to his insanity. These were properly excluded, not only because they were unsworn testimony, but because they were given in a different proceeding and upon a different issue. Thomson may have been insane to the extent of being dangerous if set at liberty, and yet may have had sufficient mental capacity to make a will, to enter into contracts, transact business, and be a witness. In the case of Leggate v. Clark, 111 Mass. 308, the admission of similar testimony was treated as error. In addition to this, however, these certificates were both dated December 14, 1885, more than two months before the will was made, and are by no means inconsistent with the other testimony that he was released from the asylum as cured February 1, 1886, and that three weeks after that, when he executed the will, he appeared to be of sound and disposing mind and memory.\n In addition to the proof of his commitment to the asylum, and of his undoubted insanity prior and for some time subsequent thereto, there was slight evidence of insane acts during the month of February, though there was no opinion expressed by anyone that he was incapable of making a valid deed or contract. The whole testimony regarding his insanity was duly submitted to the jury, who were instructed that if they found his insanity to be permanent in its nature and character, the presumptions were that it would continue, and the \n\n[196 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n burden was upon the defendant to satisfy the jury by a preponderance of testimony that he was, at the time of executing the will, of sound mind. There was no error in this instruction.\n There were also a large number of exceptions taken to the admission or exclusion of testimony and to the charge of the court, but to consider them in detail would subserve no useful purpose. We have examined them carefully, and have come to the conclusion that there was no ruling of the court of which the plaintiffs were entitled to complain. The evidence of insanity was very slight, and there was no legal testimony to show that the will was executed under the pressure of an undue influence.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEPNER v.

Wilfley for defendant in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n Solic\nitor General Hoyt \n\n\n[195 U.S. 100, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Thomas E. Kepner, a practising lawyer in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, was sharged with a violation of the law in the embezzlement of the funds of his client (estafa.) Upon trial, in November, 1901, in the court of first instance, without a jury, he was acquitted, it being the judgment of the court that he was not guilty of the offense charged. Upon appellate proceedings by the United States to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, the judgment of the court of first instance, finding the accused not guilty, was reversed, and Kepner was found guilty, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 111]\n\u00a0\n year, eight months, and twenty-one days, suspended from any public office or place of trust, and deprived of the right of suffrage.\n Error was assigned in the appellate court upon the ground that the accused had been put in jeopardy a second time by the appellate proceedings, in violation of the law against putting a person twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and contrary to the Constitution of the United States.\n The appeal was taken by the United States on December 20, 1901. A motion to dismiss the appeal was made on January 1, 1902. The motion was finally overruled on October 11, 1902; the final decision in the case, finding the accused guilty, and imposing the sentence, was rendered on December 3, 1902\n\n\n A proper consideration of the question herein made renders it necessary to notice some of the steps by which the jurisdiction of the courts in which the accused was tried was established.\n The United States acquired the Philippine Islands by cession under the treaty of peace executed at Paris, between the United States and Spain, on December 10, 1898, the final ratifications being exchanged April 11, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1754].\n The islands, after American occupation, had been under military rule prior to the creation of the Philippine Commission.\n Under the control of the military government, orders had been issued, among others, military order number 58, dated April 23, 1900, which order was in part as follows;\n'General Orders, No. 58.\n\n Manila, P. I., April 23, 1900.\n'In the interests of justice, and to safeguard the civil liberties of the inhabitants of these islands, the Criminal Code of Procedure now in force therein is hereby amended in certain of its important provisions as indicated in the following enumerated sections:\n\n ... * * \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 112]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 3. All public offenses triable in courts of first instance or in courts of similar jurisdiction, now established or that hereafter may be established, must be prosecuted by complaint or information.\n ... * *\n'Rights of accused at the trial.\n\n'Sec. 15. In all criminal prosecutions the defendant shall be entitled:\n\n'1. To appear and defend in person and by counsel at every stage of the proceedings.\n\n'2. To be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\n\n\n 3. \nTo testify as a witness in his own behalf; but if a defendant offers himself as a witness, he may be cross-examined as any other witness. His neglect or refusal to be a witness shall not in any manner prejudice or be used against him.\n'4. To be exempt from testifying against himself.\n\n'5. To be confronted at the trial by and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. Where the testimony of a witness for the prosecution has previously been taken down by question and answers in the presence of the accused or his counsel, the defense having had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the deposition of the latter may be read, upon satisfactory proof to the court that he is dead or insane, or cannot with due diligence be found in the islands.\n\n\n 6. \nTo have compulsory process issue for obtaining witnesses in his own favor.\n'7. To have a speedy and public trial.\n\n'8. To have the right of appeal in all cases.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 43. From all final judgments of the courts of first instance or courts of similar jurisdiction, and in all cases in which the law now provides for appeals from said courts, an appeal may be taken to the supreme court, as hereinafter prescribed. . . .\n\n'Sec. 44. Either party may appeal from a final judgment, \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 113]\n\u00a0\n or from an order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the appellant, or in any cases now permitted by law. The United States may also appeal from a judgment for the defendant, rendered on a demurrer to an information or complaint, and from an order dismissing a complaint or information.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 50. It shall not be necessary to forward to the supreme court the record, or any part thereof, of any case in which there shall have been an acquittal, or in which the sentence imposed does not exceed confinement in prison for one year, or a fine of 250 pesos, exclusive of costs, unless such case shall have been duly appealed. But such sentences shall be executed upon the order of the court in which the trial was had. The record in cases in which the death penalty, or imprisonment exceeding one year, or a fine exceeding 250 pesos, exclusive of costs of trial, shall have been imposed, shall be forwarded to the clerk of the criminal branch of the supreme court within twenty days, but not earlier than fifteen days after the rendition of the sentence. All cases involving sentence of death, or of imprisonment exceeding six years, or of fine exceeding 1250 pesos or in which an appeal shall have been taken, shall be submitted to the criminal branch of the supreme court, and shall thereafter take the same course as is now provided by law. Cases forwarded to the supreme court involving sentences less serious than those hereinbefore last mentioned, and not appealed, shall be referred by the clerk to the ministerio fiscal for consideration, and if the latter return the same, concurring in the sentence imposed, the record shall immediately be returned to the trial court for execution of sentence. If the ministerio fiscal shall not concur in the sentence, the case shall be submitted to the criminal branch of the supreme court, and shall thereafter take the same course as is now provided by law when that officer shall recommend a sentence in any respect more severe than that imposed by the trial judge, and for the consideration of the \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 114]\n\u00a0\n court, without the necessity of a further defense or hearing, when that officer recommends a lighter sentence.'\n\n This order was amended by an act of the Commission (No. 194), passed August 10, 1901, and is as follows: '(G) No. 194. An Act Conferring Jurisdiction on Justices of the Peace, etc.\n'Sec. 1. Every justice of the peace in the Philippine Islands is hereby invested with authority to make preliminary investigation of any crime alleged to have been committed within his municipality, jurisdiction to hear and determine which is by law now vested in the judges of courts of first instance. . . .\n\n'Sec. 4. So much of  50 of said general order No. 58 as requires courts of first instance, or clerks thereof, to forward to the supreme court or the ministerio fiscal the record of all criminal cases for revision or consideration, except where the death penalty is imposed as the judgment or part of the judgment of such court of first instance, is hereby repealed, and it shall not be necessary to forward to the supreme court or the ministerio fiscal the record, or any part thereof, of any case in which there shall have been an acquittal, or in which the penalty imposed is not death, unless such case shall have been duly appealed, as provided in such order. The records of all cases in which the death penalty shall have been imposed by any court of first instance, whether the defendant shall have appealed or not, shall be forwarded to the supreme court for investigation and judgment, as law and justice shall dictate.'\n\n Courts were established for the islands under an act passed by the Commission June 11, 1901:\n'Sec. 2. The judicial power of the government of the Philippine Islands shall be vested in a supreme court, courts of first instance, and courts of justices of the peace, together with such special jurisdictions of municipal courts and other special tribunals as now are or hereafter may be authorized by law. The two courts first named shall be courts of record.\n\n ... * * \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 115]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 16. The jurisdiction of the supreme court shall be of two kinds:\n'1. Original; and\n\n'2. Appellate.\n\n'Sec. 17. The supreme court shall have original jurisdiction to issue write of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus and quo warranto in the cases and in the manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure, and to hear and determine the controversies thus brought before it, and in other cases provided by law.\n\n'Sec. 18. The supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it from courts of first instance, and from other tribunals from whose judgment the law shall specially provide an appeal to the supreme court.\n\n'Sec. 19. The supreme court shall have power to issue writs of certiorari and all other auxiliary writs and process necessary to the complete exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 39. The existing audiencia or supreme court is hereby abolished, and the supreme court provided by this act is substituted in place thereof.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 55. The jurisdiction of courts of first instance shall be of two kinds:\n\n'1. Original; and\n\n'2. Appellate.\n\n'Sec. 56. Courts of first instance shall have original jurisdiction . . . . 6. in all criminal cases in which a penalty of more than six months' imprisonment or a fine exceeding $100 may be imposed.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 65. The existing courts of first instance are hereby abolished, and the courts of first instance provided by this act are substituted in place thereof. \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 116]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 66. There shall be courts of justice of the peace as in this section provided:\n\n'1. The existing courts of justices of the peace established by military orders since the 13th day of August, 1898, are hereby recognized and continued, and the justices of such courts shall continue to hold office during the pleasure of the Commission.\n\n'2. In every provines in which there now is, or shall hereafter be established, a court of first instance, courts of justice of the peace shall be established in every municipality thereof which shall be organized under the municipal code, or which has been organized and is being conducted as a municipality, when this act shall take effect, under and by virtue of the municipal code.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 68. A justice of the peace shall have original jurisdiction for the trial of all misdemeanors and offenses arising within the municipality of which he is a justice, in all cases where the sentence might not by law exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of $100. . . .'\n\n On July 1, 1902, Congress passed an act (32, Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369): 'Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, Temporarily to Provide for the Administration of the Affairs of Civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for Other Purposes.\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the action of the President of the United States in creating the Philippine Commission, and authorizing said Commission to exercise the powers of government to the extent, and in the manner and form, and subject to the regulation and control set forth in the instructions of the President to the Philippine Commission, dated April seventh, nineteen hundred, and in creating the offices of civil governor and vice governor of the Philippine Islands, and authorizing said civil governor and vice governor to exercise the powers of government to the extent and in the manner and form set forth in the executive \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 117]\n\u00a0\n order dated June twenty-first, nineteen hundred and one, and in establishing four executive departments of government in said islands as set forth in the act of the Philippine Commission, entitled 'An Act Providing an Organization for the Departments of the Interior, of Commerce and Police, of Finance and Justice, and of Public Instruction,' enacted September sixth, nineteen hundred and one, is hereby approved, ratified, and confirmed, and until otherwise provided by law the said islands shall continue to be governed as thereby and herein provided, and all laws passed hereafter by the Philippine Commission shall have an enacting clause as follows: 'By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine Commission.' The provisions of section eighteen hundred and ninety-one of the Revised Statutes of eighteen hundred and seventy-eight shall not apply to the Philippine Islands.\n\n'Future appointments of civil governor, vice governor, members of said Commission, and heads of executive departments shall be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 5. That no law shall be enacted in said islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.\n\n'That in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf.\n\n'That no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law; and no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment, nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\n\n'That all persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses. \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 118]\n\u00a0\n 'That no law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be enacted.\n\n'That no person shall be imprisoned for debt.\n\n'That the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless, when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be suspended by the President, or by the governor, with the approval of the Philippine Commission, wherever, during such period, the necessity for such suspension shall exist.\n\n'That no ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted.\n\n'That no law granting a title of nobility shall be enacted, and no person holding any office of profit or trust in said islands shall, without the consent of the Congress of the United States, accept any present, emolument, office, of title of any kind whatever from any king, queen, prince, or foreign state.\n\n'That excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.\n\n'That the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.\n\n'That neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist in said islands.\n\n'That no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.\n\n'That no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed.\n\n'That no money shall be paid out of the treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation by law.\n\n'That the rule of taxation in said islands shall be uniform. \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 119]\n\u00a0\n 'That no private or local bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in the title of the bill.\n\n'That no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized.\n\n'That all money collected on any tax levied or assessed for a special purpose shall be treated as a special fund in the treasury, and paid out for such purpose only.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 9. That the supreme court and the courts of first instance of the Philippine Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided, and such additional jurisdiction as shall hereafter be prescribed by the government of said islands, subject to the power of said government to change the practice and method of procedure. The municipal courts of said islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided by the Philippine Commission, subject in all matters to such alteration and amendment as may be hereafter enacted by law; and the chief justice and associate justices of the supreme court shall hereafter be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall receive the compensation heretofore prescribed by the Commission until otherwise provided by Congress. The judges of the court of first instance shall be appointed by the civil governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission: Provided, that the admiralty jurisdiction of the supreme court and courts of first instance shall not be changed except by act of Congress.\n\n'Sec. 10. That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm the final judgments and decrees of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings now pending therein or hereafter determined thereby in which the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title, right, or privilege of the United States is involved, or in causes in \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 120]\n\u00a0\n which the value in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, or in which the title or possession of real estate exceeding in value the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, to be ascertained by the oath of either party or of other competent witnesses, is involved or brought in question; and such final judgments or decrees may and can be reviewed, revised, reversed, modified, or affirmed by said Supreme Court of the United States on appeal or writ of error by the party aggrieved, in the same manner, under the same regulations, and by the same procedure, as far as applicable, as the final judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of the United States.'\n\n The act just quoted became a law before the final conviction of the accused in the supreme court of the islands.\n It is contended by the government that that part of the law under immediate consideration, which provides that no person, for the same offense, shall be twice put in jeopardy, must be construed in view of the system of laws prevailing in the islands before the same were ceded to the United States, and that the purpose of Congress was to make effectual the jurisprudence of the islands as known and established before American occupation, and that the provision against double jeopardy must be read in the light of the understanding of that expression in the civil law, or rather the Spanish law, as it was then in force.\n The citations in the brief of the learned counsel for the government seem to establish that under the Spanish law, as theretofore administered, one who had been convicted by a judgment of the court of last resort could not again be prosecuted for the same offense. We notice some of these provisions:\n In Spanish law the doctrine found expression in Fuero Real (A. D. 1255) and the Siete Partidas (A. D. 1263).\n'After a man, accused of any crime, has been acquitted by the court, no one can afterwards accuse him of the same offense (except in certain specified cases). Fuero Real, lib. iv., title XXi., 1, 13. \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 121]\n\u00a0\n 'If a man is acquitted by a valid judgment of any offense of which he has been accused, no other person can afterwards accuse him of the offense ( except in certain cases). Siete Partidas, Part vii., title i, 1. XII.'\n\n In the encyclopedia of Spanish law, published by Don Lorenzo Arrazola in 1848, it is said, in considering the persons who may be accused of crime:\n'It is another of the general exceptions that a person cannot be accused who has formerly been accused and adjudged of the same crime, since the most essential effect of all judicial decisions upon which execution can issue is to constitute unalterable law. Tomo, I., page. 511.'\n\n Under that system of law it seems that a person was not regarded as being in jeopardy in the legal sense until there had been a final judgment in the court of last resort. The lower courts were deemed examining courts, having preliminary jurisdiction, and the accused was not finally convicted or acquitted until the case had been passed upon in the audiencia, or supreme court, whose judgment was subject to review in the supreme court at Madrid for errors of law, with power to grant a new trial. The trial was regarded as one continuous proceeding, and the protection given was against a second conviction after this final trial had been concluded in due form of law. The change introduced under military order No. 58, as amended by act 194 of the Commission, made the judgment of the court of first instance final, in cases other than capital, whether the accused be convicted or acquitted, unless an appeal was prosecuted by the government or the accused in the manner pointed out.\n In order to determine what Congress meant in the language used in the act under consideration, 'No person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment,' we must look to the origin and source of the expression, and the judicial construction put upon it before the enactment in question was passed. A consideration of the events preceding this regulation makes evident the intention of Congress to \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 122]\n\u00a0\n carry some, at least, of the essential principles of American constitutional jurisprudence to these islands, and to engraft them upon the law of this people, newly subject to our jurisdiction.\n That it was the intention of the President in the instructions to the Philippine Commission to adopt a well-known part of the fundamental law of the United States, and to give much of the beneficent protection of the Bill of Rights to the people of the Philippine Islands, is not left to inference; for in his instructions, dated April 7, 1900 (see Public Laws and Resolutions of Philippine Com., 6-9), he says:\n'In all the forms of government and administrative provisions which they are authorized to prescribe, the Commission should bear in mind that the government which they are establishing is designed not for our satisfaction or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness, peace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands, and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs, their habits, and even their prejudices, to the fullest extent consistent with the accomplishment of the indispensable requisites of just and effective government.'\n\n But he was careful to add:\n'At the same time the Commission should bear in mind, and the people of the islands should be made plainly to understand, that there are certain great principles of government which have been made the basis of our governmental system, which we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom, and of which they have, unfortunately, been denied the experience possessed by us; that there are also certain practical rules of government which we have found to be essential to the preservation of these great principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and these rules of government must be established and maintained in their islands for the sake of their liberty and happiness, however much they may conflict with the customs of laws or procedure with which they are familiar. It is evident that the most \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 123]\n\u00a0\n enlightened thought of the Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of these principles and rules, and they will inevitably, within a short time, command universal assent. Upon every division and branch of the government of the Philippines, therefore, must be imposed these inviolable rules: 'That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense; that excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense or be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself; that the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except as a punishment for crime; that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed; that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or of the rights of the people to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances; that no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.'\n\n These words are not strange to the American lawyer or student of constitutional history. They are the familiar language of the Bill of Rights, slightly changed in form, but not in substance, as found in the first nine amendments to the Constitution of the United States, with the omission of the provision preserving the right to trial by jury and the right of the people to bear arms, and adding the prohibition of the 13th Amendment against slavery or involuntary servi- \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 124]\n\u00a0\n tude except as a punishment for crime, and that of article 1,  9, to the passage of bills of attainder and ex post facto laws. These principles were not taken from the Spanish law; they were carefully collated from our own Constitution, and embody almost verbatim the safeguards of that instrument for the protection of life and liberty.\n When Congress came to pass the act of July 1, 1902, it enacted, almost in the language of the President's instructions, the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. In view of the expressed declaration of the President, followed by the action of Congress, both adopting, with little alteration, the provisions of the Bill of Rights, there would seem to be no room for argument that in this form it was intended to carry to the Philippine Islands those principles of our government which the President declared to be established as rules of law for the maintenance of individual freedom, at the same time expressing regret that the inhabitants of the islands had not theretofore enjoyed their benefit.\n How can it be successfully maintained that these expressions of fundamental rights, which have been the subject of frequent adjudication in the courts of this country, and the maintenance of which has been ever deemed essential to our government, could be used by Congress in any other sense than that which has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they were taken?\n It is a well-settled rule of construction that language used in a statute which has a settled and well-known meaning, sanctioned by judicial decision, is presumed to be used in that sense by the legislative body. The Abbotsford, \n98 U.S. 440\n, 25 L. ed. 168.\n It is not necessary to determine in this case whether the jeopardy provision in the Bill of Rights would have become part of the law of the islands without congressional legislation. The power of Congress to make rules and regulations for territory incorporated in or owned by the United States is settled by an unbroken line of decisions of this court, and is no longer open to question. American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 125]\n\u00a0\n Pet. 511, 7 L. ed. 242; Murphy v. Ramsey, \n114 U.S. 15\n, 29 L. ed. 47, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747; Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S. v. United States, \n136 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 43 S., 34 L. ed. 481, 491, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 792; Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, 45 L. ed. 1088, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787. This case does not call for a discussion of the limitations of such power, nor require determination of the question whether the jeopardy clause became the law of the islands after the ratification of the treaty, without Congressional action, as the act of Congress made it the law of these possessions when the accused was tried and convicted.\n It is argued that in the act of July 1, 1902, Congress recognized the jurisdiction of the Philippine courts in  9 as follows:\n'Sec. 9. That the supreme court and the courts of first instance of the Philippine Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided, and such additional jurisdiction as shall hereafter be prescribed by the government of said islands, subject to the power of said government to change the practice and method of procedure.'\n\n The argument is, that Congress intended to leave the right of appeal as provided by military order No. 58, as amended by the Commission, in full force.\n But Congress, in  5, had already specifically provided that no person should be put twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. While  9 recognizes the established jurisdiction of the courts of the islands, it was not intended to repeal the specific guaranty of  5, which is direct legislation pertaining to the particular subject. It is a well- settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject-matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.

The language of the Constitution, as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law. 1 Kent Com. 336; Bradley, J., in Moore v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 23 S. L. ed. 346, 347.'\n\n At the common law, protection from second jeopardy for the same offense clearly included immunity from second prosecution where the court having jurisdiction had acquitted the accused of the offense. The rule is thus stated by Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, quoted by Mr. Justice Story in United States v. Gibert, 2 Sumn. 39 Fed. Cas. No. 15,204:\n'The plea (says he) of autrefois acquit is grounded on this maxim, that a man shall not be brought into danger of his life for one and the same offense more than once. From whence it is generally taken by all our books, as an undoubted consequence, that where a man is once found not guilty, on an indictment or appeal, free from error, and well commenced before any court which hath jurisdiction of the cause, he may, by the common law, in all cases, plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent indictment or appeal for the same crime.'\n\n In this court is was said by Mr. Justice Miller, in Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L. ed. 872:\n'The common law not only prohibited a second punishment for the same offense, but went further, and forbid a second trial for the same offense, whether the accused had suffered punishment or not, and whether, in the former trial, he had been acquired or convicted.'\n\n And in as late a case as Wemyss v. Hopkins, L. R. 10 Q. B. 378, it was held that a conviction before a court of competent \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 127]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, even without a jury, was a bar to a second prosecution.\n In that case the appellant had been summarily convicted before a magistrate for negligently, and by wilful misconduct, driving a carriage against a horse ridden by the respondent, and was afterwards convicted on the same facts for unlawful assault. It was held that the first conviction was a bar to the second. In the course of the opinion it was said by Blackburn, J.:\n'I think the fact that the appellant had been convicted by justices under one act of Parliament for what amounted to an assault is a bar to a conviction under another act of Parliament for the same assault. The defense does not arise on a plea of autrefois convict, but on the well- established rule at common law, that where a person has been convicted and punished for an offense by a court of competent jurisdiction, Transit in rem judicatam; that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same offense, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different punishments for the same offense. The only point raised is whether a defense in the nature of a plea of autrefois convict would extend to a conviction before two justices whose jurisdiction is created by statute. I think the fact that the jurisdiction of the justices is created by statute makes no difference. Where the conviction is by a court of competent jurisdiction it matters not whether the conviction is by a summary proceeding before justices or by trial before a jury.'\n\n In the same case it was said by Lush, J.: 'I am also of opinion that the second conviction should be quashed, upon the ground that it violated a fundamental principle of law, that no person shall be prosecuted, twice for the same offense. The act charged against the appellant on the first occasion was an assault upon the respondent while she was riding a horse on the highway, and it therefore became an offense for which the appellant might be punished under either of two \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 128]\n\u00a0\n statutes. The appellant was prosecuted for the assault, and convicted under one of the statutes, 3 and 4 Wm. IV., chap. 50,  78, and fined, and he therefore cannot be afterwards convicted again for the same act under the other statute.'\n It is true that some of the definitions given by the text-book writers, and found in the reports, limit jeopardy to a second prosecution after verdict by a jury, but the weight of authority, as well as decisions of this court, have sanctioned the rule that a person has been in jeopardy when he is regularly charged with a crime before a tribunal properly organized and competent to try him; certainly so after acquittal. Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 U.S. 509\n, 24 L. ed. 1118. Undoubtedly in those jurisdictions where a trial of one accused of crime can only be to a jury, and a verdict of acquittal or conviction must be by a jury, no legal jeopardy can attach until a jury has been called and charged with the deliverance of the accused. But, protection being against a second trial for the same offense, it is obvious that where one has been tried before a competent tribunal having jurisdiction he has been in jeopardy as much as he could have been in those tribunals where a jury is alone competent to convict or acquit. People v. Miner, 144 Ill. 308, 19 L. R. A. 342, 33 N. E. 40; State v. Bowen, 45 Minn. 145, 47 N. W. 650; State v. layne, 96 Tenn. 668, 36 S. W. 390.\n In United States v. Sanges, \n144 U.S. 310\n, 36 L. ed. 445, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, it was held that a writ of error did not lie in favor of the United States in a criminal case; Mr. Justice Gray said:\n'From the time of Lord Hale to that of Chadwick's Case [11 Q. B. 173, 205], just cited, the text-books, with hardly an exception, either assume or assert that the defendant (or his representative) is the only party who can have either a new trial or a writ of error in a criminal case; and that a judgment in his favor is final and conclusive. See 2 Hawk. P. C. chap. 47,  12; chap. 50,  10 et seq.; Bacon Abr. Trial, L. 9, Error, B.; 1 Chitty, Crim. Law, 657, 747; Starkie, Crim. Pl. 2d ed. 357, 367, 371; Archbold, Crim. Pr. & Pl. 12th Eng. and 6th Am. ed. 177, 179.\n\n'But whatever may have been, or may be, the law of \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 129]\n\u00a0\n England upon that question, it is settled by an overwhelming weight of American authority that the state has no right to sue out a writ of error upon a judgment in favor of the defendant in a criminal case, except under and in accordance with express statutes, whether that judgment was rendered upon a verdict of acquittal, or upon the determination by the court of a question of law.'\n\n In the course of the opinion Justice Gray cites, among other cases, Com. v. Cummings and Com. v. McGinnis, opinion by Chief Justice Shaw, 3 Cush. 212, 50 Am. Dec. 732. In Archbold, Crim. Pl. & Pr. Pomeroy's ed., 199, it was said: 'There is no instance of error being brought upon a judgment for a defendant, after an acquittal.'\n That the learned justice could not have intended to intimate that a second prosecution could be allowed by statute after an acquittal of the offense is shown by the subsequent decision of this court in United States v. Ball, \n163 U.S. 662\n, 41 L. ed. 300, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192, in which Mr. Justice Gray also delivered the opinion of the court. In that case an attempt was made to prosecute for the second time one Millard F. Ball, who had been acquitted upon a defective indictment, which had been held bad upon the proceedings in error prosecuted by others jointly indicted with Millard F. Ball, who had been convicted at the trial. The court below held Ball's plea of former jeopardy to be bad. But this court reversed the judgment, and in the course of the opinion it was said:\n'The Constitution of the United States, in the 5th Amendment, declares, 'Nor shall any person be subject to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial. An acquittal before a court having no jurisdiction is, of course, like all the proceedings in the case, absolutely void, and therefore no bar to subsequent indictment and trial in a court which has jurisdiction of the offense. Com. v. Peters, 12 Met. 387; 2 Hawk. P. C. \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 130]\n\u00a0\n chap. 35,  3; 1 Bishop, Crim. Law,  1028. But although the indictment was fatally defective, yet, if the court had jurisdiction of the cause and of the party, its judgment is not void, but only voidable by writ of error; and, until so avoided, cannot by collaterally impeached. If the judgment is upon a verdict of guilty, and unreversed, it stands good and warrants the punishment of the defendant accordingly, and he could not be discharged by a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n, 23 L. ed. 787. If the judgment is upon an acquittal, the defendant, indeed, will not seek to have it reversed, and the government cannot, United States v. Sanges, \n144 U.S. 310\n, 36 L. ed. 445, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609. But the fact that the judgment of a court having jurisdiction of the case is practically final affords no reason for allowing its validity and conclusiveness to be impugned in another case. . . . As to the defendant who had been acquitted by the verdict duly returned and received, the court could take no other action than to order his discharge. The verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting him twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution. However it may be in England, in this country a verdict of acquittal, although not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. United States v. Sanges, \n144 U.S. 310\n, 36 L. ed. 445, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609; Com. v. Tuck, 20 Pick. 356, 365; West v. State, 22 N. J. L. 212, 231; 1 Lead. Crim. Cas. 532.'\n\n It is, then, the settled law of this court that former jeopardy includes one who has been acquitted by a verdict duly rendered, although no judgment be entered on the verdict, and it was found upon a defective indictment. The protection is not, as the court below held, against the peril of second punishment, but against being again tried for the same offense.\n We are not here dealing with those statutes which give to the government a right of review upon the steps merely preliminary to a trial and before the accused is legally put in jeopardy, as where a discharge is had upon motion to quash, or a demurrer to the indictment is sustained before jeopardy \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 131]\n\u00a0\n has attached. Such statutes have been quite generally sustained in jurisdictions which deny the right of second trial where a competent court has convicted or acquitted the accused. People v. Webb, 38 Cal. 467. Mr. Bishop, in his work upon Criminal Law, sums up the scope and authority of such statutes as follows:\n'A legislative provision for the rehearing of criminal causes cannot be interpreted-or, at least, it cannot have force-to violate the constitutional rule under consideration, whatever be the words in which the provision is expressed. When, therefore, a defendant has been once in jeopardy, the jeopardy cannot be repeated without his consent, whatever statute may exist on the subject. Such a statute will be interpreted with the Constitution, and be held to apply only to cases where it constitutionally may. And if it undertakes to give to the state the right of appeal, to retry the party charged, after acquittal, it is invalid. And so the writ of error, or the like, allowed to the state, can authorize the state to procure the reversal of erroneous proceedings and commence anew, only in those cases in which the first proceeding did not create legal jeopardy.' 1 Bishop, Crim. Law, 5th ed.  1026.\n\n The author's conclusion has support in the case of People v. Miner, 144 Ill. 308, 19 L. R. A. 342, 33 N. E. 40, wherein a statute giving an appeal when the accused had been acquitted before a competent tribunal was held in violation of  10, article 2, of the Constitution of that state, providing that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. So in the case of People v. Webb, 38 Cal. 467, a statute undertaking to give the right of appeal to the people in criminal cases was held to be limited to the cases in which errors in the proceedings may occur before legal jeopardy has attached. In the course of a well- considered opinion it was said:\n'The question thus presented is of most grave importance, and, so far as we are advised, has never been directly passed upon by this court; hence we have given it a most patient consideration, and after a careful examination of the authorities \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 132]\n\u00a0\n as to the construction of similar provisions in the constitutions of other states, and the Constitution of the United States, we are entirely satisfied that this court has no authority in criminal cases, under our state Constitution, to order a new trial of a defendant at the instance of the prosecution for mere errors in the ruling of the court during the progress of the trial after the jury have been charged with the case, and have rendered a verdict of not guilty. No case has been called to our attention, and after a most diligent examination of authorities, we have not been able to find a single American case where a retrial has been ordered or sanctioned by an appellate court at the instance of the prosecution, after the defendant had been once put upon his trial for an alleged felony, upon a valid indictment before a competent court and jury, and acquitted by the verdict of such jury; but we find a vast number of adjudications of the highest judicial tribunals of the different states and many of the Federal courts to the effect that no such retrial is authorized by the common law, and is directly interdicted by the Constitution of the United States, and also of most of the several states. The universal maxim of the common law of England, as Sir William Blackstone expresses it, 'that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offense,' is embraced in article 5 of amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and in the Constitutions of several states, in the following language: 'Nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb$;' and in many other states the same principle is incorporated in the organic law, in language substantially the same as hereinbefore quoted from the Constitution of this state. While the Constitutions of some few states are destitute of this or any similar provision, other state Constitutions, such as of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Iowa, merely interdict a second trial for the same offense after acquittal.'\n\n The case of State v. Lee, 65 Conn. 265, 27 L. R. A. 498, 48 Am. St. Rep. 202, 30 Atl. 1110, in the reasoning of the court seems opposed to this view. But no reference \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 133]\n\u00a0\n is made in the course of the opinion to any constitutional requirement in Connecticut as to double jeopardy. An examination of the Constitution of that state and amendments as published in General Statutes of Connecticut, Revision of 1902, discloses no provision upon the subject of jeopardy, and we conclude there is none.\n The exceptional character of the decision in State v. Lee is stated by the learned editor of American State Reports in a note to the case as reported in 48 Am. St. Rep. 202, in the following language:\n'This case, in its view of former jeopardy, stands out in bold relief against the commonly understood meaning of what constitutes once in jeopardy.'\n\n And further:\n'The law almost universally prevalent is that a verdict of acquittal in a criminal case is final and conclusive, and that there can be no new trial of a criminal prosecution after an acquittal in it. People v. Corning, 2 N. Y. 9, 49 Am. Dec. 364, and note,' 48 Am. St. Rep. 213, 214.\n\n The Ball Case, \n163 U.S. 662\n, 41 L. ed. 300, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192, establishes that to try a man after a verdict of acquittal is to put him twice in jeopardy, although the verdict was not followed by judgment. That is practically the case under consideration, viewed in the most favorable aspect for the government. The court of first instance, having jurisdiction to try the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused, found Kepner not guilty; to try him again upon the merits, even in an appellate court, is to put him a second time in jeopardy for the same offense, if Congress used the terms as construed by this court in passing upon their meaning. We have no doubt that Congress must be held to have intended to have used these words in the well-settled sense, as declared and settled by the decisions of this court.\n It follows that military order No. 58, as amended by act of the Philippine Commission No. 194, in so far as it undertakes to permit an appeal by the government after acquittal, was \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 134]\n\u00a0\n repealed by the act of Congress of July, 1902, providing immunity from second jeopardy for the same criminal offense.\n This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider, if the question was presented in this case, whether the accused was entitled to the right of a trial by jury.\n Judgment reversed and prisoner discharged.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, with whom concurred Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n I regret that I am unable to agree with the decision of the majority of the court. The case is of great importance, not only in its immediate bearing upon the administration of justice in the Philippines, but, since the words used in the act of Congress are also in the Constitution, even more because the decision necessarily will carry with it an interpretation of the latter instrument. If, as is possible, the constitutional prohibition should be extended to misdemeanors (Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 173, 21 L. ed. 872, 877), we shall have fastened upon the country a doctrine covering the whole criminal law, which, it seems to me, will have serious and evil consequences. At the present time in this country there is more danger that criminals will escape justice than that they will be subjected to tyranny. But I do not stop to consider or to state the consequences in detail, as such considerations are not supposed to be entertained by judges, except as inclining them to one of two interpretations, or as a tacit last resort in case of doubt. It is more pertinent to observe that it seems to me that logically and rationally a man cannot be said to be more than once in jeopardy in the same cause, however often he may be tried. The jeopardy is one continuing jeopardy, from its beginning to the end of the cause. Everybody agrees that the principle in its origin was a rule forbidding a trial in a new and independent case where a man already had been tried once. But there is no rule that a man may not be tried twice in the same case. It has been decided by this court that he may be tried a second time, even for his life, if the jury \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 135]\n\u00a0\n disagree (United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L. ed. 165; see Simmons v. United States, \n142 U.S. 148\n, 35 L. ed. 968, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171; Logan v. United States, \n144 U.S. 263\n, 36 L. ed. 429, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617; Thompson v. United States \n155 U.S. 271\n, 39 L. ed. 146, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 73), or, notwithstanding their agreement and verdict, if the verdict is set aside on the prisoner's exceptions for error in the trial. Hopt v. Utah, \n104 \nU.S. 631, 635\n, 26 S. L. ed. 873, 874, \n110 U.S. 574\n, 28 L. ed. 262, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 202, \n114 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 29 S. L. ed. 186, 185, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 972, \n120 \nU.S. 430, 442\n, 30 S. L. ed. 708, 712, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 614; United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 672\n, 41 S. L. ed. 300, 303, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192. He even may be tried on a new indictment if the judgment on the first is arrested upon motion. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 174, 21 L. ed. 872, 878; 1 Bishop, Crim. Law, 5th ed.  998. I may refer further to the opinions of Kent and Curtis, in People v. Olcott, 2 Johns. Cas. 301; 2 Day, 507, note; United States v. Morris, 1 Curt. C. C. 23, Fed. Cas. No. 15,815, and to the well-reasoned decision in State v. Lee, 65 Conn. 265, 27 L. R. A. 498, 48 Am. St. Rep. 202, 30 Atl. 1110.\n If a statute should give the right to take exceptions to the government, I believe it would be impossible to maintain that the prisoner would be protected by the Constitution from being tried again. He no more would be put in jeopardy a second time when retried because of a mistake of law in his favor, than he would be when retried for a mistake that did him harm. It cannot matter that the prisoner procures the second trial. In a capital case, like Hopt v. Utah, a man cannot waive, and certainly will not be taken to waive without meaning it, fundamental constitutional rights. Thomspon v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 353\n, 354 S., 42 L. ed. 1061, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620. Usually no such waiver is expressed or thought of. Moreover, it cannot be imagined that the law would deny to a prisoner the correction of a fatal error unless he should waive other rights so important as to be saved by an express clause in the Constitution of the United States.\n It might be said that when the prisoner takes exceptions he only is trying to get rid of a jeopardy that already exists,-that so far as the verdict is in his favor, as when he is found guilty of manslaughter upon an indictment for murder, according to some decisions he will keep it, and can be retried only for the less offense, so that the jeopardy only is con- \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 136]\n\u00a0\n tinued to the extent that it already has been determined against him, and is continued with a chance of escape. I believe the decisions referred to to be wrong, but, assuming them to be right, we must consider his position at the moment when his exceptions are sustained. The first verdict has been set aside. The jeopardy created by that is at an end, and the question as, What shall be done with the prisoner? Since at that moment he no longer is in jeopardy from the first verdict, if a second trial in the same case is a second jeopardy even as to the less offense, he has a right to go free. In view of these difficulties it has been argued that, on principle, he has that right if a mistake of law is committed at the first trial. 1 Bishop, Crim. Law, 5th ed.  999, 1047. But even Mr. Bishop admits that the decisions are otherwise, and the point is settled in this court by the cases cited above. That fetish happily being destroyed, the necessary alternative is that the Constitution permits a second trial in the same case. The reason, however, is not the fiction that a man is not in jeopardy, in case of a misdirection, for it must be admitted that he is in jeopardy, even when the error is patent on the face of the record; as when he is tried on a defective indictment, if judgment is not arrested. United States v. Ball, \n163 U.S. 662\n, 41 L. ed. 300, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192. Moreover, if the fiction were true it would be equally true when the misdirection was in favor of the prisoner. The reason, I submit, is that there can be but one jeopardy in one case. I have seen no other, except the suggestion of waiver, and that I think cannot stand.\n If what I have said so far is correct, no additional argument is necessary to show that a statute may authorize an appeal by the government from the decision by a magistrate to a higher court, as well as an appeal by the prisoner. The latter is everyday practice, yet there is no doubt that the prisoner is in jeopardy at the trial before the magistrate, and that a conviction or acquittal not appealed from would be a bar to a second prosecution. That is what was decided, and it is all that was decided or intimated, relevant to this case, in Wemyss \n\n[195 U.S. 100, 137]\n\u00a0\n v. Hopkins, L. R. 10 Q. B. 378. For the reasons which I have stated already, a second trial in the same case must be regarded as only a continuation of the jeopardy which began with the trial below.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting:\n Under our Anglo-Saxon system of jurisprudence I have always supposed that a verdict of acquittal upon a valid indictment terminated the jeopardy, that no further proceedings for a review could be taken either in the same or in an appellate court, and that it was extremely doubtful whether even Congress could constitutionally authorize such review.\n Conceding all this, however, I think that in applying the principle to the Philippine Islands, Congress intended to use the words in the sense in which they had theretofore been understood in those islands. By that law, in which trial by jury was unknown, the jeopardy did not terminate, if appeal were taken to the audiencia or supreme court, until that body had acted upon the case. The proceedings before the court of first instance were, in all important cases, reviewable by the supreme court upon appeal which acted finally upon the case, and terminated the jeopardy. This was evidently the view of the military commander in general order No. 58, and of the Philippine Commission in the act of August 10, 1901 (No. 194), in both of which an appeal to the supreme court was contemplated, even after a judgment of acquittal. I think this also must have been the intention of Congress, particularly in view of  9 of the Philippine act of July 1, 1902, which provided that 'the supreme court and the courts of first instance of the Philippine Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided . . . subject to the power of said government to change the practice and modes of procedure.' It seems to me impossible to suppose that Congress intended to place in the hands of a single judge the great and dangerous power of finally acquitting the most notorious criminals. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKIRBY v. AMERICAN SODA FOUNTAIN CO.(1904)\nNo. 357\nArgued: Decided: April 25, 1904\n\n\n\n\n Kirby filed his first original amended petition in the district court of Dallas county, Texas, against the American Soda Fountain Company, averring that he was induced by false representations by defendant to agree to exchange his soda fountain apparatus for the soda fountain apparatus of defendant, and pay defendant $2,025 in addition, and signed a memorandum in relation thereto, which, however, plaintiff alleged did not contain all the terms of the contract; that the exchange was made, but defendant's soda fountain apparatus, instead of being superior in value by $ 2,025, was, as matter of \n\n[194 U.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n fact, less by $2,500; and plaintiff prayed for the cancelation of the obligation to pay $2,025, for $2,500 damages, and for general relief. The original petition sought damages merely, and in the sum of $1,500.\n On application of defendant the cause was removed to the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Texas.\n The case was entered in that court May 12, 1902, and on that day defendant filed its answer, denying all charges of fraud, and setting up the written contract between plaintiff and itself, which it alleged contained all the terms of the agreement between them, whereby defendant agreed to manufacture and ship to plaintiff, and plaintiff purchased of defendant, a certain soda fountain machine at the price of $3,219; and defendant agreed to take plaintiff's machine in part payment, at the sum of $1,194, leaving a balance of $2,205, which plaintiff agreed to pay, and which was secured by a mortgage lien on the property. That defendant manufactured and shipped the machine to plaintiff and set it up in his store, and fully complied with the contract, but plaintiff, after paying $ 325 on account of the $2,025, failed and refused to further comply with the contract or to pay anything more thereon.\n Defendant said plaintiff ought to take nothing by his suit, and prayed judgment for the sum of $1,700 and for foreclosure of its mortgage lien. Together with its answer defendant filed its cross complaint, setting up the facts in detail and praying for judgment in the sum of $1, 700, and interest, and for a decree establishing its mortgage lien on the property, and for foreclosure and sale, and such further relief as euqity might require.\n Subpoena on the cross complaint was issued and served May 13, 1902\n\n\n June 20, 1902, plaintiff moved to transfer the cause to the law docket; and on that date the following order was entered of record: 'Complainant coming and asking that the original bill of complaint be dismissed without prejudice, and it ap- \n\n[194 U.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n pearing to the court that said request should be granted, it is therefore ordered that the original bill of complaint herein be and the same is hereby dismissed without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to proceed further on the cause of action set forth in said bill hereafter as he may be advised. It is further ordered that the costs of the original bill and proceedings thereon herein be adjudged against complainant, for which execution may issue.'\n July 24, 1902, plaintiff, as defendant in the cross complaint, filed his plea thereto, in which he averred that the original bill filed by him had been dismissed, and that the cross bill was not within the jurisdiction of the court because the amount sought to be recovered did not exceed $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs. February 13, 1903, the plea to the jurisdiction of the court was argued and overruled, and plaintiff, defendant in the cross bill, was ordered to file an answer to said cross bill on or before the rule day of the court occurring in April, 1903. No further answer or plea to the cross bill having been interposed by the defendant therein, a decree pro confesso was rendered against him April 21.\n On May 27, 1903, the court rendered a decree on the cross bill, which recited the various proceedings; found the allegations of the cross complaint and exhibits to be true; that Kirby was justly indebted to the American Soda Fountain Company in the sum of $1,700, with interest; and that a valid mortgage lien to secure that sum existed; and decreed payment of the amount within sixty days, and that, if not paid, the property should be sold and the proceeds applied, with judgment for deficiency, if any.\n An appeal from this decree was prayed and allowed, and the question of jurisdiction was certified. The case came on in this court on motions to dismiss or affirm.\n Mr. Joseph m. McCormick for appellant.\n Mr. John J. Wced for appellee.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was brought directly to this court on a certificate of jurisdiction under  5 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549] and might, therefore, have been advanced under rule 32. The motions to dismiss or affirm may be treated as equivalent to submission under that rule, but as the motions were made, and the motion to dismiss was chiefly rested on the ground that the value of the matter in dispute was not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction, we think it proper to say that 'the act of 1891 nowhere imposes a pecuniary limit upon the appellate jurisdiction, either of this court or the circuit court of appeals, from a district or circuit court of the United States.' The Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 683\n, 44 S. L. ed. 320, 322, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290, 293.\n On this appeal no question of error in matter of equity procedure in the retaining of the cross bill after the dismissal of the bill is open for consideration, but we do not intimate in the slightest degree that any error in that particular was committed. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Third Nat. Bank, \n134 U.S. 276\n, 33 L. ed. 900, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550; Dan. Ch. Pr. 5th ed. 1553, note; Bates Eq. Proc.  386.\n The contention is that the circuit court had no jurisdiction as a court of the United States to proceed on the cross bill because of the lack of the prescribed jurisdictional amount. But we think the circuit court was right in rejecting this contention and in overruling the plea.\n In the first place, the whole record being considered, the value of the matter in dispute might well have been held to exceed $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Stinson v. Dousman, 20 How. 461, 466, 15 L. ed. 966, 969; New England Mortg. Security Co. v. Gay, \n145 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 36 S. L. ed. 646, 649, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 815; Shappirio v. Goldberg, \n192 U.S. 232\n, ante, p. 259, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; Lovell v. Cragin, \n136 U.S. 130\n, 34 L. ed. 372, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1024.\n In Stinson v. Dousman, the suit was brought to recover something less than $500 as rent of a parcel of land under a written contract for the purchase of the land \n\n[194 U.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n at $8,000, which provided that the covenantee should pay rent on failure to comply with sundry conditions prescribed, and defendant not only set up in his answer a defense to the claim for rent, but also sought a decree affirming the contract as outstanding. It was objected in this court that the matter in dispute was not of the value of $1,000, and that therefore there was no jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Campbell said: 'The objection might be well founded, if this was to be regarded merely as an action at common law. But the equitable as well as the legal considerations involved in the cause are to be considered. The effect of the judgment is to adjust the legal and equitable claims of the parties to the subject of the suit. The subject of the suit is not merely the amount of rent claimed, but the title of the respective parties to the land under the contract. The contract shows that the matter in dispute was valued by the parties at $8, 000. . . . We think this court has jurisdiction.' The case is cited and considered in New England Mortg. Security Co. v. Gay and in Shappirio v. Goldberg.\n In Lowell v. Cragin, it was held as correctly stated in the head notes: 'When the matter set up in a cross bill is directly responsive to the averments in the bill, and is directly connected with the transactions which are set up in the bill as the gravamen of the plaintiff's case, the amount claimed in the cross bill may be taken into consideration in determining the jurisdiction of this court on appeal from a decree on the bill.'\n In the present case the circuit court in its decree referred to the plaintiff's bill and the relief thereby sought, in connection with the cross bill, and, we think, was justified in doing this, as the record had not passed from under its control, and it was apparent that the decree on the cross bill disposed of the contention of plaintiff in respect of the cancelation of the contract. Taking the bill, defendant's answer, and the cross bill together, the jurisdictional amount was made out.\n In the second place, it is the general rule that when the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States has once attached \n\n[194 U.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n it will not be ousted by subsequent change in the conditions. Morgan v. Morgan, 2 Wheat. 290, 4 L. ed. 242; Clarke v. Mathewson, 12 Pet. 165, 9 L. ed. 1041; Kanouse v. Martin, 15 How. 198, 208, 14 L. ed. 660, 664; Roberts v. Nelson, 8 Blatchf. 74, Fed. Cas. No. 11,907; Cooke v. United States, 2 Wall. 218, 17 L. ed. 755.\n In Morgan v. Morgan it was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall that the jurisdiction of the circuit court, having once vested between citizens of different states, could not be devested by a change of domicil of one of the parties, and his removal into the same state as the adverse party Pendente lite. This was so ruled in Clarke v. Mathewson and other cases there cited.\n In Kanouse v. Martin, after petition to remove had been filed and bond tendered, the state court allowed the plaintiff to reduce the matter in dispute to less than the jurisdictional amount, and went on with the case. This was necessarily held to be erroneous, but the observations of Mr. Justice Curtis show that, in his opinion, the general rule to which we have referred also applied, and he cites Morgan v. Morgan and Clarke v. Mathewson.\n In Roberts v. Nelson the amount claimed was reduced after the case had been removed, and Mr. Justice Blatchford, then district judge, held that the jurisdiction of the court having once attached, no subsequent event could devest it.\n In Cooke v. United States, Mr. Chief Justice Chase said that 'jurisdiction once acquired cannot be taken away by any change in the value of the subject of controversy.'\n This action, when brought in the state court, was an action to recover $1,500 damages for deceit. Defendant demurred to and answered the original petition. Plaintiff subsequently filed his amended petition seeking to be relieved of the obligation to pay $2,025, and damages in the sum of $2,500. The matter in dispute having thus been made to exceed the sum or value of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, defendant presented his petition and bond for removal, and the cause was thereupon removed. The jurisdiction thus acquired by the circuit court was not devested by plaintiff's subsequent action.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNEPPER v. SANDS(1904)\nNo. 233\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Mr. I. S. Struble for Knepper.\n Messrs. John H. King, N. B. Davis, and King & Stearns for Sands.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This cause is before us upon questions certified by the circuit court of appeals pursuant to the judiciary act of March 3d, 1891, chap. 517 (26 Stat. at L. 826, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488).\n The controlling facts in the extended statement sent up by the judges of the circuit court of appeals, as the basis of the questions propounded, are these:\n By an act approved May 12th, 1864, chap. 84, Congress made a grant of lands to the state of Iowa for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from Sioux City to the south line of Minnesota, at such point as the state might select; the lands to be held subject to the disposal of its legislature, for that purpose only. Upon the completion of each section of ten consecutive miles of road it became the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to issue to the state patents for one hundred sections for the benefit of the constructing company; and so on, until the road was completed, when the whole of the lands granted were to be patented 'to the state for the uses aforesaid, and none other.' 13 Stat. at L. 72,  1, 2, 3.\n If the road was not completed within ten years from the acceptance of the grant by the constructing company, then the lands granted and not patented were to 'revert to the state' for the purpose of securing the completion of the road within such time, not exceeding five years, and upon such \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n terms as the state should determine,-the lands not in any manner to be disposed of or encumbered except as the same were patented under the provisions of the act, and upon the failure of the state to complete the road within five years after the above ten years, then the lands undisposed of were to 'revert to the United States.'  4.\n The state accepted the grant, April 3d, 1866, upon the conditions prescribed by Congress, and authorized the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company, a Minnesota corporation, to construct the road. The company entered upon the work of construction, and completed only five sections of ten miles each, receiving the full amount of land to which it was entitled by reason of such construction.\n In consequence of the failure of the railroad company to complete the construction of the road, the state declared, by an act approved March 16th, 1882, that, in respect of all lands and rights to land granted or intended to be granted to that company, they 'are herby absolutely and entirely resumed by the state of Iowa, and that the same be and are absolutely vested in said state as if the same had never been granted to said company.' Before the passage of that act the state, through its executive officers, ascertained by computation that the railroad company had received conveyances for all lands it was entitled to receive under the terms of the grant, and that the state then held legal title to 85,457. 41 acres pertaining to the grant, no part of which had then or ever since been earned by the company. The land in question here was a part of those unearned lands.\n Subsequently, by an act which took affect April 2d, 1884, the state relinquished to the United States all its right, title, and interest in the lands which, by the above act of 1882, were declared vested in the state.\n The land here in dispute, being section 9, township 95, north of range 42, west of the fifth principal meridian, in O'Brien county, Iowa, was open and unoccupied when the above act of April 2d, 1884, was passed. In 1885 Sands settled \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n upon it, erected thereon a house, and made improvements with a view of establishing a homestead, in accordance with the laws of the United States. He has continuously since resided upon the land, claiming it as a homestead. Shortly after he settled upon it he made application to enter it as a homestead, but his application was rejected; for what reason rejected, does not appear.\n Later, by an act approved March 3d, 1887, Congress provided for the adjustment of land grants made by Congress to aid in the construction of railroads, and for the forfeiture of unearned lands. 24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595).\n The 1st section of that act provided for the immediate adjustment, in accordance with the decisions of this court, of each of the railroad land grants which then remained unadjusted. The second section provided for the recovery by the United States of the title to lands erroneously certified or patented by the United States to, or for the use or benefit of, any company claiming by, through, or under grant from the United States, to aid in the construction of a railroad. That section made it the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to demand from such company a relinquishment or reconveyance to the United States of all such lands, whether within granted or indemnity limits, and, if the demand was not complied with, then it became the duty of the Attorney General to institute suit against the company. The third section provided that homestead or pre-emption entries of bona fide settlers, which were found to have been erroneously canceled, may be perfected upon compliance with the public land laws and certain conditions, and the settler reinstated in his rights. If the settler did not renew his application within a reasonable time, to be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior, then all such unclaimed lands were to be disposed of under the public land laws,-according a priority of right to bona fide purchasers of the unclaimed lands, if any, and if there be no such purchasers, then to bona fide settlers residing thereon. \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n The 4th section, upon the construction of which the present case mainly depends, is in these words: ' 4. That as to all lands, except those mentioned in the foregoing section, which have been so erroneously certified or patented, as aforesaid, and which have been sold, by the grantee company, to citizens of the United States, or to persons who have declared their intention to become such citizens, the person or persons, so purchasing in good faith, his heirs or assigns, shall be entitled to the land so purchased, upon making proof of the fact of such purchase, at the proper land office, within such time, and under such rules, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, after the grants, respectively, shall have been adjusted; and patents of the United States shall issue therefor, and shall relate back to the date of the original certification or patenting, and the Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the United States, shall demand payment from the company, which has so disposed of such lands, of an amount equal to the government price of similar lands; and in case of neglect or refusal of such-company to make payment, as hereafter specified, within ninety days after the demand shall have been made, the Attorney General shall cause suit or suits to be brought against such company for the said amount: Provided, That nothing in this act shall prevent any purchaser of lands erroneously withdrawn, certified, or patented, as aforesaid, from recovering the purchasemoney therefor from the grantee company, less the amount paid to the United States by such company, as by this act required. . . .' 24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595).\n As showing the nature of the title of the state under the act of 1864, reference may here be made to a suit brought by the United States against the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company, under which company, as will presently appear, the appellant claims. By the final decree in that case the title of the United States was quieted as to certain lands situated in Dickinson and O'Brien counties, and claimed by the railroad company under the act of 1864. In the \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n opinion in that case, which was decided here October 21st, 1895, the court said: 'Another contention is, that upon the issuing of the patents of 1872 and 1873 to the state for the use and benefit of the railroad company, the title vested absolutely in the company, and the lands were thereby freed from restraints of alienation, from conditions subsequent, or from liability to forfeiture. In support of this contention reference is made to Bybee v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n139 \nU.S. 663, 674\n, 676 S., 677, 35 L. ed. 305, 307, 308, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641; Van Wyck v. Knevals, \n106 U.S. 360\n, 27 L. ed. 201, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336; Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 U.S. 496\n, 33 L. ed. 687, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341; Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, \n142 U.S. 241\n, 35 L. ed. 999, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158; St. Paul & P. R. Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. \n139 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 35 S. L. ed. 77, 79, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389. But these are cases, as an examination of them will show, in which the grant was directly to the railroad company, or in which the act of Congress required that the patents for lands earned should be issued, not to the state, for the benefit of the railroad company, but directly to the company itself. In the case now before us the statute directed patents to be issued to the state for the benefit of the company. So that, until the state disposed of the lands, the title was in it, as trustee, and not in the railroad company. Schulenberg v. Harriman 21 Wall. 44, 59, 22 L. ed. 551, 554; Lake Superior Ship Canal, R. & Iron Co. v. Cunningham, \n155 U.S. 372\n, 39 L. ed. 189, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 103. See also McGregor & M. R. Co. v. Brown, 39 Iowa, 655; Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. Osceola County, 43 Iowa, 318, 321. In the case last named the Sioux City Company was relieved from the payment of taxes upon some of the lands patented to the state for its benefit, upon the ground that the legal title was in the state, and the lands for that reason were not taxable. The question is altogether different from what it would be if patents for these lands had been issued, or if the state had conveyed them directly to that company.' Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 349, 363\n, 40 S. L. ed. 177, 182, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17. It was there adjudged that the railroad company had received 2,004.89 acres more than, in any view of its rights, should have been awarded to it.\n After the decision of that case the Secretary of the Interion, \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n under date of November 18th, 1895, published a circular, in which he declared the land here in controversy and other like land subject to disposal by the Land Department. This was after the above application by Sands to enter this land as a homestead.\n Subsequently, on the 10th of March, 1896, Sands renewed his application for the land in question as a nomestead. That application was contested in the local land office by the present appellant, who asserted a right to the land in virtue of a purchase of it from the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company on June 21st, 1887, and in virtue of the provisions of the 4th section of the above adjustment act of March 3d, 1887. She had never resided upon the land in controversy, or cultivated the same, or in any manner attempted to comply with the homestead laws of the United States for the purpose of obtaining a title under them. This contest was determined at the local office in favor of Sands,-that office finding that he had, by virtue of his settlement of, and continued residence upon, and cultivation of, the land, and by full compliance with the homestead laws of the United States, become entitled to a patent. That decision was confirmed by the Commissioner of the Land Office. But, upon appeal to the Secretary of the Interior, the decisions of the local land office and of the Commissioner were reversed, and Sands's application to enter the land as a homestead was rejected. Thereupon the present suit was commenced by Sands, charging that the officers of the General Land Office, proceeding under the decision of the Secretary, were about to issue, or had issued, a patent to the present appellant solely in virtue of her alleged purchase on June 21st, 1887, from the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company, after the passage of the adjustment act of March 3d, 1887, and in virtue of its 4th section. Sands, alleging that such action, if taken, would be unlawful and contrary to law, prayed that the Commissioner be required to accept his proof showing settlement upon and continuous cultivation of the land for the period of five years or more, and that the patent \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n to appellant Knepper be either declared null and void, or for a decree declaring that she holds the legal title in trust for him.\n Such is the case made by the statement by the judges of the circuit court of appeals, who propound to this court the following questions:\n'First. In view of the provisions of the act of Congress of May 12th, 1864, by virtue of which the land in controversy was granted to the state of Iowa, did the action which was subsequently taken in manner and form aforesaid by the governor and legislature of the state of Iowa operate as a final adjustment of the grant, so far as the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company was concerned, and, by virtue of its being so adjusted, exempt or except the grant in question from the provisions of the adjustment act of March 3d, 1887?\n\n'Second. In view of the terms of the granting act of May 12th, 1864, and the action subsequently taken in manner and form aforesaid by the state of Iowa, acting through its governor and legislature, can Elmira Knepper, the appellant, be esteemed a purchaser in good faith or a bona fide purchaser of the land in controversy, within the meaning of the 4th section of the adjustment act of March 3d, 1887, as against John A. Sands, the appellee, who was in the open possession of the land in controversy, and had erected valuable improvements thereon, in manner and form aforesaid, when said purchase was made?'\n\n We have seen that the appellant claims an interest in the lands here in question in virtue of a purchase made by her from the railroad company, June 21st, 1887, after the passage of the adjustment act of March 3d, 1887. But what interest had the company at that time in these particular lands constituting a part of the 85,457.41 acres of unearned lands, no part of which the company earned or could have earned except on account of road actually constructed by it? For such road as the company had constructed, lands had been conveyed to it, and there never was a moment according to the record, when the company could have rightfully demanded from the state \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n a conveyance or patent for the lands here in dispute or for any of the unearned lands. The legal title to the lands granted by the act of 1864 was, first in the United States, next in the state (Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, \n159 U.S. 349\n, 40 L. ed. 177, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17), but never in the company until a conveyance to it by the state. The state could only have conveyed lands to the company in consideration of constructed road; and subject to that condition the company undertook to construct the road. When it abandoned the work of construction it lost the right to claim lands except for such road as it had previously constructed. The state, therefore, properly resumed, as by the act of 1882 it did resume, after the company's default, such title to the unearned lands as it had before authorizing the company to construct the road. The state, after thus resuming the title, could have used the unearned lands to aid in the construction of that portion of the road which the railroad company failed to construct. But it did not do so, and hence, by the act of April 2d, 1884,-eighteen years after it accepted, in 1866, the grant of 1864, and the completion of the road having been abandoned,-the state, by statute, formally relinquished to the United States all its right, title, and interest in the unearned lands pertaining to the Sioux City & St. Paul Railroad Company. This statute was, perhaps, unncessary, as, by the act of 1864, the title to the unearned lands granted by that act was to revert to the United States after the expiration of fifteen years from the acceptance of the grant without the completion of the road. But the relinquishment by the state saved the necessity, if there was a necessity, of formal proceedings, legislative or judicial, by the United States, to reinvest itself with full title. Thus, the title to the unearned lands was put back into the United States. So that, when the adjustment act of 1887 was passed, the title of the United States to the unearned lands, including the particular lands here in dispute, was complete and perfect. No interest then remained in the state or in the railroad company requiring an adjustment; for, as stated, the state had \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n relinquished all its claim, and the railroad company had received all the lands it was entitled to demand for constructed road. When, therefore, Congress made provision in the 4th section of the act of 1887 for the protection of those who, in good faith, had purchased from any 'grantee company,' to whom lands had been erroneously certified or patented, it could not have intended to refer to purchases made from the railroad company, after that act took effect, of lands originally certified or patented to the state, and not to the railroad company, and the legal title to which was in the United States at the date of the passage of the act. A chief purpose of the act of 1887 was to declare forfeited unearned lands, and restore them to the public domain; and not to give third parties and speculators an opportunity to purchase such lands from companies which had defaulted in the work of construction, and to whom the state had never conveyed, and thereby obtain a preference over actual settlers in possession. The policy of the government has always been favorable to actual settlers. As late as Ard v. Brandon, \n156 U.S. 537\n, 39 L. ed. 524, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406, it was said that 'the law deals tenderly with one who, in good faith, goes upon the public land with a view of making a home thereon.' See also Northern P. R. Co. v. Amacker, \n175 U.S. 564\n, 44 L. ed. 274, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236; Moss v. Dowman, \n176 U.S. 413\n, 44 L. ed. 526, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429; Rector v. Gibbon, \n111 U.S. 276\n, 28 L. ed. 427, 4 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 302.\n We are of opinion that the 4th section of the adjustment act of 1887 has no reference to any unearned lands purchased after the date of that act from a company to whom they had never been certified or patented, although, if it had kept its engagement with the state, and completed the road in due time, it could have acquired an interest in them; and that, as the state, by legislative enactment, had resumed the title it acquired from the United States, and afterwards relinquished its interest to the United States,-all before the passage of the adjustment act,-the appellant could not, within the meaning of the act, and after its passage, have become a purchaser in good faith of the lands here in dispute. The sale by the rail- \n\n[194 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n road company to the appellant was a sale of something it did not possess; a mere device to bring its purchaser within the provisions of the adjustment act of 1887, when that act was never intended to apply to such a case.\n We, therefore, answer the second question in the negative, and omit, as unnecessary, any answer to the first one.\n It will be so certified. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE v. ROBINSON(1904)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. William H. Lyles for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. D. W. Robinson for defendant in error.\n Mr. William Elliott, Jr., as amicus curioe.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action to recover land, brought by Robinson, the defendant in error, a citizen and resident of North Carolina, against Lee, a citizen and resident of South Carolina, on the ground that Robinson had purchased the land at a tax sale. \n\n[196 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n The value of the land is alleged and found to be more than $2,000. The defense is that a tender was made of the amount of the taxes before the sale. This tender included, as a part of it, revenue bond scrip of the state of South Carolina for $5, purporting on its face to be receivable in payment of taxes, and the question is whether the tender was good; or, more precisely, whether the bond scrip was receivable for taxes under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of South Carolina. The circuit court held the tender bad, on the double ground that the issue of the scrip was in contravention of the Constitution of the state and that the scrip was a bill of credit within the prohibition of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States. 122 Fed. 1012. Judgment was given for the plaintiff, Robinson, and this writ of error was brought, setting up that the contract rights of the defendant under the Constitution of the United States were impaired by the laws hereafter mentioned which excluded the reception of the scrip for the tax.\n Counsel other than those representing the parties was permitted to file a brief as amicus curioe, and urged that this was a collusive suit. But the circuit court held that it was not (122 Fed. 1010), and we accept the finding for the purposes of disposing of the case.\n The revenue bond scrip was issued under an act of March 2, 1872, entitled 'An Act to Relieve the State of South Carolina of All Liability for Its Guaranty of the Bonds of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, by Providing for the Securing and Destruction of the Same.' This act purported to authorize the issue to the amount of $1,800,000, 'which revenue bond scrip shall be signed by the state treasurer, and shall express that the sum mentioned therein is due by the state of South Carolina to the bearer thereof, and that the same will be received in payment of taxes and all other dues to the state, except special tax levied to pay interest on the public debt.' But the supreme court of the state held that the scrip constituted bills of credit within the prohibition of the Constitution of the \n\n[196 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n United States, article 1,  10. State ex rel. Shiver v. Comptroller General, 4 S. C. N. S. 185. The pledge of the state's credit and the provisions for the redemption of the scrip were repealed by the legislature, and, under the fiscal laws of the state, the scrip had not been receivable for taxes since 1873\n\n\n We are of opinion that the issue of the scrip was forbidden by the Constitution of the state. When the scrip was issued, the Constitution of South Carolina, ratified on April 16, 1868, in article 9,  10, provided as follows: 'No scrip, certificate, or other evidence of state indebtedness shall be issued except for the redemption of stock, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness previously issued, or for such debts as are expressly authorized in this Constitution.' There was also a further provision that 'any debt contracted by the state shall be by loan on state bonds, of amounts not less than $50 each, on interest payable within twenty years after the final passage of the law authorizing such debt.'\n The guaranty from which the scrip was to relieve the state was a guaranty of bonds of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, which was indorsed upon them by authority of an act approved September 15, 1868. The state long had favored this road, and had held its stock. It had authorized the guaranty of bonds in 1852, and again in 1854, repealing the former act. But the act of 1868 recited that the comptroller general of the state had not indorsed any of the bonds issued under the act of 1854, and that the conditions imposed upon such indorsement had become impossible and injudicious. So it might be assumed from the face of the statute of 1868 that there was no outstanding liability represented by the guaranty under that statute, and we see no ground for doubt that the guaranty must be considered as a new contract, made for the first time, in substance as well as form, after the Constitution of 1868 went into effect.\n The guaranty under the act of 1868 cannot be put under the head of 'such debts as are expressly authorized in this Constitution,' since it was not in the form required for debts \n\n[196 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n contracted under the Constitution of 1868. We are of opinion that it equally little satisfies the other exception in article 9,  10, quoted above, of a contract made for the redemption of an 'evidence of indebtedness previously issued.' Whether the word 'previously' refers to the date of the Constitution or to the date of issuing the guaranty, the guaranty of 1868 is not and does not purport to be made for the redemption of a previous evidence of debt.\n It is argued that, whether there was a liability or not, the acts before 1868 having purported to pledge the credit of the state to secure the bonds of the railroad company, as they did, there was color of liability, and the act of 1868, or, at any rate, the act of 1872, authorizing the bond scrip, was the adjustment of a claim against the state under article 14,  4, of the state Constitution. But the act of 1868 did not purport to be an adjustment. On the contrary, it purported, as we have said, to give new aid to the railroad, and to authorize an original issue. The act of 1872, again, dealt only with the supposed liability under the act of 1868, and provided for the satisfaction of that. If that liability did not exist, the statute no more could ratify it than it could call it into being. The liability for which scrip could be issued was required by the Constitution to be one existing before the issue was made. Moreover, the act of 1872 did not purport to be an adjustment of a matter in dispute, or an adjustment in any sense. It simply assumed that there was an outstanding liability, and provided for the satisfaction of it. The question is not whether payment of the bond scrip would be valid, but whether the bond scrip was issued under the conditions which the state Constitution imposed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEIGH v. GREEN(1904)\nNo. 119\nArgued: January 13, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n The facts essential to the determination of this case are briefly summarized as follows: Irwin Davis was the owner of certain lands in Knox county, Nebraska. On the 24th day of November, 1880, an action was begun by Algernon S. Patrick against Davis, in the district court of the county, and an attachment was issued and levied upon the lands. The case was afterwards removed to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Nebraska, on October 18, 1882, where on January 21, 1890, an order for the sale of the lands in question was made for the satisfaction of the judgment, and the same were sold on May 15, 1894, by the United States marshal to Lionel C. Burr. Burr afterwards conveyed the lands to Crawford and Peters. On June 23, 1894, Crawford and Peters conveyed the premises to Alvin L. Leigh, the plaintiff in error in the present case.\n Pending said attachment proceedings, on December 28, 1882, \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n a deed was filed for record in the clerk's office of Knox county, purporting to convey the lands to Henry A. Root on October 8, 1880. Afterwards, on May 12, 1894, a decree was rendered in the district court of Douglass county, Nebraska, in a cause wherein said Patrick was plaintiff and Davis and others were defendants, setting aside the deed from Davis to Root as fraudulent and void as against the said Patrick.\n In 1891 actions were brought in the district court of Knox county, wherein the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company was plaintiff and Henry A. Root and different subdivisions of the lands were defendants, for the foreclosure of certain tax liens, which actions, taken together, cover the lands in controversy in the present suit.\n In the same year, 1891, decrees were entered in those cases, and orders made directing the sale of the lands for the satisfaction of the amounts found due by the decrees. In pursuance of said decrees the lands were sold by the sheriff to Henry S. Green, defendant in error in the present action. The deeds of conveyance were made and delivered to him by the sheriff. Plaintiff in error claims title because of the attachment proceedings, and defendant in error bases his claim to title upon the proceedings had for the foreclosure of the tax liens. This suit was brought by the plaintiff in error Leigh, in the district court of Knox county, to quiet title to the lands in controversy.\n In that court a decree was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in error Leigh, which decree was reversed by the supreme court of Nebraska, and the cause remanded with directions to render a decree in favor of the defendant Green.\n This writ of error is prosecuted to review the judgment of the supreme court of Nebraska.\n J. M. Woolworth and W. D. McHugh for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward P. Smith and William R. Green for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion is made to dismiss because the claim of impairment of a right secured by the 14th Amendment was not made in the courts of Nebraska until the motion for rehearing was filed in the supreme court. We are unable to discover a specific claim of this character made prior to the motion for rehearing. In the motion reference is made to the failure of the Nebraska supreme court to decide the claim theretofore made, that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because of the alleged violation of the right to due process of law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Be this as it may, the supreme court of Nebraska entertained the motion and decided the Federal question raised against the contention of the plaintiff in error. In such case the question is reviewable here, although first presented in the motion for rehearing. Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 U.S. 589\n, 45 L. ed. 1015, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730.\n The Federal question presented for our consideration is briefly this: Is the Nebraska statute under which the sale was made and under which the defendant in error claims title, in failing to make provision for service of notice of the pendency of the proceedings upon a lienholder, such as Patrick, a deprivation of property of the lienholder without due process of law within the protection of the 14th Amendment?\n The statutes of Nebraska under which the conveyances were made to the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company are given in the margin. \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n The evident purpose of  4, where the owner of the land is unknown, is to permit a proceeding in rem, against the land itself, with a provision for service as in case of a nonresident. By  6 it is provided that in cases where the \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n land itself is made defendant the deed shall be an absolute bar against all persons, unless the court proceedings are void for want of jurisdiction. The object and intent of the action is defined to be 'to create a new and independent title, by virtue of the sale, entirely unconnected with all prior titles.'\n The supreme court of Nebraska has held that the term 'owner,' as used in the 4th section, applies to the owner of the fee, and does not include a person holding a lien upon the premises. It is this section (4) and  6 which are alleged to be in conflict with the 14th Amendment. The argument for the appellant concedes that the state may adopt summary or even stringent measures for the collection of taxes so long as they are 'administrative' in their character; and it is admitted that such proceedings will not devest the citizen of his property without due process of law, although had without notice of assessments or levy, or of his delinquency and the forfeiture of his lands. But the argument is, that when the state goes into court and invokes judicial power to give effect to a lien upon property, although created to secure the payment of taxes, the same principles and rules prevail which govern private citizens seeking judicial remedies, and require service on all interested parties within the jurisdiction. The right to levy and collect taxes has always been recognized as one of the supreme powers of the state, essential to its maintenance, and for the enforcement of which the legislature may resort to such remedies as it chooses, keeping within those which do not impair the constitutional rights of the citizen. Whether property is taken without due process of law depends upon the nature of each particular case. If it be such an exercise of power 'as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims prescribe \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n for the classes to which the one in question belongs,' it is due process of law. Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 506.\n The most summary methods of seizure and sale for the satisfaction of taxes and public dues have been held to be authorized, and not to amount to the taking of property without due process of law, as a seizure and sale of property upon warrant issued on ascertainment of the amount due by an administrative officer (Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 18 How. 272, 15 L. ed. 372), the seizure and forfeiture of distilled spirits for the payment of the tax (Henderson's Distilled Spirits, 14 Wall. 44, 20 L. ed. 815). The subject underwent a thorough examination in the case of Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 24 L. ed. 616, in which Mr. Justice Miller, while recognizing the difficulty of defining satisfactorily due process of law in terms which shall apply to all cases, and the desirability of judicial determination upon each case as it arises, used this language: 'That whenever, by the laws of a state, or by state authority, a tax, assessment, servitude, or other burden is imposed upon property for the public use, whether it be for the whole state or of some limited portion of the community; and those laws provide for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge thus imposed, in the ordinary courts of justice, with such notice to the person, or such proceeding in regard to the property, as is appropriate to the nature of the case,-the judgment in such proceedings cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law, however obnoxious it may be to other objections.'\n In the present case, the argument is that as the state has not seen fit to resort to the drastic remedy of summary sale of the land for delinquent taxes, but has created a lien in favor of a purchaser, at tax sale, after permitting two years to elapse in which the owner or lienholder may redeem the property, it has, in authorizing a foreclosure without actual service, taken property without due process of law, because the proceedings and sale to satisfy the tax lien do not require all lienholders within the jurisdiction of the court to be served with process. If the state may proceed summarily, we see no reason why it may not resort to such judicial proceedings as are authorized \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 89]\n\u00a0\n in this case. And if the state may do so, is the property owner injured by a transfer of such rights to the purchaser at the tax sale, who is invested with the authority of the state? In Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 24 L. ed. 616, the objection was made that the state could not delegate its power to a private corporation to do certain public work, and by statute fix the price at which the work should be done. In that connection, speaking of the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L. ed. 394, Mr. Justice Miller said: 'The right of the state to use a private corporation and confer upon it the necessary powers to carry into effect sanitary regulations was affirmed, and the decision is applicable to a similar objection in the case now before us.'\n In the statute under consideration, for the purpose of collecting the public revenue, the state has provided for the enforcement of a lien by the purchaser at a tax sale, and authorized him to proceed against the land subject to the tax, to enforce the right conferred by the state. The state has a right to adopt its own method of collecting its taxes, which can only be interfered with by Federal authority when necessary for the protection of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. In authorizing the proceedings to enforce the payment of the taxes upon lands sold to a purchaser at tax sale, the state is in exercise of its sovereign power to raise revenues essential to carry on the affairs of state and the due administration of the laws. This fact should not be overlooked in determining the nature and extent of the powers to be exercised. 'The process of taxation does not require the same kind of notice as is required in a suit at law, or even in proceedings for taking private property under the power of eminent domain. It involves no violation of due process of law when it is executed according to in subordination to the principles which underlie in subordination to the principles which underile them.' Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 239\n, 33 S. L. ed. 892, 896, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, 535.\n In authorizing the proceedings under the statute to enforce the lien of the purchaser, who has furnished the state its revenue in reliance upon the remedy given against the land assessed, the state is as much in the exercise of its sovereign power to collect the public revenues as it is in a direct proceeding \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 90]\n\u00a0\n to distrain property or subject it to sale in summary proceedings.\n Nor is the remedy given in derogation of individual rights, as long recognized in proceedings in rem, when the 14th Amendment was adopted. The statute undertakes to proceed in rem, by making the land, as such answer for the public dues. Of course, merely giving a name to an action as concerning the thing rather than personal rights in it cannot justify the procedure if in fact the property owner is deprived of his estate without due process of law. But it is to be remembered that the primary object of the statute is to reach the land which has been assessed. Of such proceedings, it is said in Cooley on Taxation, 2d ed. 527: 'Proceedings of this nature are not usually proceedings against parties; nor, in the case of lands or interests in lands belonging to persons unknown, can they be. They are proceedings which have regard to the land itself rather than to the owners of the land; and if the owners are named in the proceedings, and personal notice is provided for, it is rather from tenderness to their interests, and in order to make sure that the opportunity for a hearing shall not be lost to them, than from any necessity that the case shall assume that form.' And see Winona & St. P. Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 U.S. 537\n, 40 L. ed. 247, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 83.\n Such being the character of the proceedings, and those interested having an opportunity to be heard upon application, the notice was in such form as was reasonably calculated to bring the same to the attention of those interested in the lands. In the present case the notice was in the form given in the margin. \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 91]\n\u00a0\n This notice was to all persons interested in the property. The lienholder, the Nebraska court has held, may appear in court and set up his claim. The notice was good as against the world, and all that is necessary when the proceedings are in rem:\n'Laws exist under which property is responsible for damages done by it, for taxes imposed upon it. . . . These same laws often authorize the obligation by them imposed upon the property to be enforced by proceedings in which the property is the defendant and in which no service of process is required except upon such property. The judgment resulting from such a proceeding is in rem, and satisfaction thereof is produced by an execution authorizing the sale of the property. The sale acts upon the property, and, in so acting, necessarily affects all claimants thereto.' Freeman, Judgm.  606.\n\n When the proceedings are in personam the object is to bind the rights of persons, and in such cases the person must be served with process; in proceedings to reach the thing, service upon it and such proclamation by publication as gives opportunity to those interested to be heard upon application is sufficient to enable the court to render judgment. Cross v. Armstrong, 44 Ohio St. 613, 624, 10 N. E. 160. Where land is sought to be sold, and is described in the notice, a technical service upon it would add nothing to the procedure where the owner is unknown. The publication of notice which describes the land \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 92]\n\u00a0\n is certainly the equal in publicity of any seizure which can be made of it.\n In Tyler v. Registration Court Judges, 175 Mass. 71, 51 L. R. A. 433, 55 N. E. 812, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts upheld as constitutional an act providing for registering and confirming titles to lands, in which the original registration deprived all persons, except the registered owner, of any interest in the land, and the act gave judicial powers to the recorder after the original registration although not a judicial officer, and there was no provision for notice before registration of transfer or dealings subsequent to the original registration. The majority opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Holmes, then chief justice of Massa chusetts. In the course of the opinion, speaking of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment, he said: 'Looked at either from the point of view of history or of the necessary requirements of justice, a proceeding in rem, dealing with a tangible res, may be instituted and carried to judgment without personal service upon claimants within the state or notice by name to those outside of it, and not encounter any provision of either Constitution. Jurisdiction is secured by the power of the court over the res.'\n In Huling v. Kaw Valley R. & Improv. Co. \n130 U.S. 559\n, 32 L. ed. 1045, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603, it was held that notice by publication in proceedings to condemn land for railway purposes was sufficient notice to nonresident owners, and was due process of law as to such owners. So as to adjudications of titles of real estate within the limits of the state as against nonresident owners, brought in by publication only. Arndt v. Griggs, \n134 U.S. 316\n-327, 33 L. ed. 918-922, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557; Hamilton v. Lewis, \n161 U.S. 256\n-274, 40 L. ed. 691-699, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585.\n The principles applicable which may be deduced from the authorities we think lead to this result: Where the state seeks directly or by authorization to others to sell land for taxes upon proceedings to enforce a lien for the payment thereof, it may proceed directly against the land within the jurisdiction of the court, and a notice which permits all interested, who are 'so minded,' to ascertain that it is to be subjected to sale to answer for taxes, and to appear and be \n\n[193 U.S. 79, 93]\n\u00a0\n heard, whether to be found within the jurisdiction or not, is due process of law within the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n In the case under consideration the notice was sufficiently clear as to the lands to be sold; the lienholders investigating the title could readily have seen in the public records that the taxes were unpaid and a lien outstanding, which, after two years, might be foreclosed and the lands sold and, by the laws of the state, an indefeasible title given to the purchaser. Such lienholder had the right for two years to redeem, or, had he appeared in the foreclosure case, to set up his rights in the land. These proceedings arise in aid of the right and power of the state to collect the public revenue, and did not, in our opinion, abridge the right of the lienholder to the protection guaranteed by the Constitution against the taking of property without due process of law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 1. That any person, persons, or corporation having by virtue of any provisions of the tax or revenue laws of this state a lien upon any real property for taxes assessed thereon, may enforce such lien by an action in the nature of a foreclosure of a mortgage for the sale of so much real estate as may be necessary for that purpose and costs of suit. \n Sec. 2. That any person, persons, or corporation holding or possessing any certificate of purchase of any real estate, at public or private tax sale, or any tax deed, shall be deemed entitled to foreclose such lien under the provisions of this act, within any time not exceeding five years from the date of tax sale (not deed) upon which such lien is based; And provided, That the taking out of a tax deed shall in nowise interfere with the rights granted in this chapter.\n Sec. 3. All petitions for foreclosure or satisfaction of any such tax lien shall be filed in the district court in chancery, where the lands are situated.\n Sec. 4. Service of process in causes instituted under this chapter shall be the same as provided by law in similar causes in the district courts, and where the owner of the land is not known the action may be brought against the land itself, but in such case the service must be as in the case of a nonresident; if the action is commenced against a person who disclaims the land, the land itself may be substituted by order of court for the defendant, and the action continued for publication.\n Sec. 5. All sales of lands under this chapter, by decree of court, shall be made by a sheriff or other person authorized by the court, in the county where the premises or some part of them are situated.\n Sec. 6. Deeds shall thereupon be executed by such sheriff, which shall vest in the purchaser the same title that was vested in the defendant to the suit at time of the assessment of the tax or taxes against the same; and such deed shall be an entire bar against the defendant to such suit, and against all parties or heirs claiming under such defendants; and in case the land itself is made defendant in the suit, the deed shall be an absolute bar against all persons, unless the court proceedings are void for want of jurisdiction; the object and intent of this action being to create a new and independent title, by virtue of the sale, entirely unconnected with all prior titles.\n Sec. 7. The proceeds of every sale made under a decree, by virtue of this chapter, shall be applied to the discharge of the debt adjudged by the court to be due and of the costs awarded, and if there be any surplus it shall be brought into court for the use of the defendant, or of the person entitled thereto, subject to the order of the court.\n Sec. 8. If such surplus, or any part thereof, shall remain in court, for the period of three months, without being applied for, the court may direct the same to be put out at interest, under the direction of the court, for the benefit of the defendant, his representatives, or assigns, to be paid to them by the order of the court; the party to whom said surplus shall be loaned to be designated by the court, and the sureties, upon which said money is loaned, to be approved by the judge.\n Sec. 9. All lands sold by the sheriff by virtue of this act shall be ap- \n praised, advertised, and sold as upon execution, and the title conferred by his deed shall be entitled to all the presumptions of any judicial sale.\n Sec. 10. This act shall be construed as cumulative, and not exclusive, in respect to the remedy for enforcing liens and collecting delinquent taxes, by sale of property or otherwise, in the cases herein provided for, and shall in nowise interfere with, alter, or amend the existing revenue laws of the state. \n Legal Notice.\n In the District Court of Knox County, Nebraska.\n The Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, Plaintiff,\n vs.\n Henry A.

Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, By M. J. Sweeley, Its Attorney. \n\n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOCKHART v. LEEDS(1904)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 20, 1904Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The appellant filed his bill in this suit, in the proper court of New Mexico, for the purpose of obtaining relief against the defendants mentioned therein. The defendants demurred on several grounds, among which was that the complainant's \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n remedy, if any, was at law, and that the bill did not state a case for a court of equity. The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed, and the judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the supreme court of New Mexico, and the complainant thereupon appealed to this court. Among other things the bill averred that, about May 7, 1893, the complainant and one Johnson and the defendant Pilkey entered into an agreement in Bernalillo county, New Mexico, by which they were to become partners in the enterprise mentioned in the agreement; and that, for the consideration mentioned therein, Pilkey was to start out to discover, if possible, and to locate for the purpose of operation by the parties, any mining claim of gold, silver, or other metal; and that, in order to enable Pilkey to carry out his portion of the agreement, he was to be furnished certain tools, etc., and some money. If he discovered any such mine, it was his duty to locate the same, and to send in to the other partners specimens of the ore, in order that its value might be determined. Work was to be begun within twenty days after the signing of the agreement. Any fraud by Pilkey was to forfeit his share, which was to be one-third interest in any mine discovered and worked.\n The agreement was to continue for a year, and all discoveries and locations of any mines during that time by Pilkey were to be under the agreement mentioned. After the making of this agreement, Pilkey started out to prospect and to discover, if possible, a mining claim of the character mentioned. The parties were aware, at the time of the execution of the agreement, of the existence of the place where Pilkey went for the purpose of prospecting and discovering a mine, and that there possibly might be a valuable claim at that place. Accordingly, Pilkey at once went to the spot, and, on or about the 10th of July, 1893, he discovered the claim at that place, and it turned out to be a valuable mine. He located the mine according to the agreement, and posted the notice thereon provided by the laws of the United States and New Mexico, and proceeded to do work thereon pursuant to the provisions \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n of those laws, but did not do all the work made necessary by them. The bill then alleges that Pilkey commenced to sink a shaft or cut upon the mineral-bearing lode, and did work enough thereon to arrive at mineral- bearing ore in place, within less than ninety days from the time of taking possession of the lode; and it is then averred that the parties were ready, able, and willing in all things to comply with the laws spoken of, 'and would have so done except for the wrongful, fraudulent, and unlawful acts of the defendants hereinafter mentioned.' Some time about the 1st of October, 1893, Pilkey, while so in possession of the lode, wrongfully and fraudulently conspired, combined, and confederated with the defendants to defraud plaintiff; and they agreed that said Pilkey, in violation and fraud of the rights of the plaintiff in and to the mine, should transfer, convey, and deliver possession of the mine to the defendants, or one of them, without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff and the said Johnson. This was done. It was also agreed that they should do all other acts necessary to transfer the right to defendants. Pilkey was to have a certain proportion of interest in the mine, and the defendants, the balance. The defendants also caused and procured the defendant Pilkey to stop work upon the mine, under the agreement already referred to; and it was also agreed that Pilkey should fail and neglect to record, in the proper office, a copy of the location notice posted by him on the ground. The defendants also covered up and concealed the work which had been done on the ground by Pilkey; and they posted another notice thereon, and called the mine the 'Washington' mine, and filed a copy of the same for record, December 13, 1893, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff or his copartner, Johnson; and they made the location for the benefit of themselves as locators, under the mining laws of the United States. For the purpose of concealing the interest of Pilkey in such pretended location, it was agreed that each of the four defendants named should be entitled to a fifth interest, and that Pilkey should be entitled to the remaining fifth, which last-named interest should \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n be claimed and held by Walker in trust for Pilkey. Johnson subsequently transferred all his interest, under the agreement of copartnership between plaintiff, Johnson, and Pilkey, to the complainant, who was, at the time of the commencement of the suit, the owner of Johnson's interest under the assignment. The bill further states that, after the removal by the defendants of the original location notice posted by Pilkey, as already stated, the complainant procured a copy thereof, and had the same recorded in the office of the recorder of the county, on December 9, 1893. The complainant averred that, by virtue of the premises, he became and was, at the commencement of the suit, the equitable owner of said mine, and of the gold and silver ores therein contained, so discovered and located by Pilkey under the agreement; and that he was equitably entitled, as against the defendants, to the possession and enjoyment of the same, and to the preferential right to acquire the legal title from the United States; and that the pretended location of the mine under the name of the Washington mine, by and in the names of the defendants named, was wholly inoperative and void; and that Pilkey, by reason of his participation in a fraudulent conspiracy with the defendants, forfeited all right or interest in the said mine pursuant to the agreement made by Pilkey with complainant and Johnson; and complainant averred that he was equitably the owner of and entitled to such interest. He further averred that the defendants refused to permit complainant to enter upon the property or to work the same; and that the defendants claim title to the mining property under and by virtue of their agreement with Pilkey, and their pretended location of the same as the Washington lode. It is further averred that the defendants were engaged in mining, extracting, and converting to their own use, the ores and minerals contained in the mine, and had mined and removed ores and minerals of great value therefrom, and had converted to their own use all such mineral; and that, unless enjoined, they would remove all the ores and minerals, and thereby the entire sub- \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n stance and value of the property would be destroyed, and the complainant would sustain irreparable injury, as the defendants, or some of them, were wholly insolvent. To this bill the defendants demurred, as already stated.\n Mr. J. H. McGowan for appellant.\n Mr. W. B. Childers for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n One phase of this controversy has already been before this court in Lockhart v. Johnson, \n181 U.S. 516\n, 46 L. ed. 979, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665, which was an ac- \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n tion of ejectment brought by the plaintiff (who is the complainant herein) to recover possession of the mine above mentioned from the defendants herein. It was there held that the plaintiff could not maintain an action, as the facts showed that he had no legal title, and that the remedy he might have, if any, was in equity.\n Upon the trial of the ejectment action the plaintiff offered to prove, in substance, the same facts as are set forth in this bill in regard to Pilkey's action under the agreement with plaintiff and Johnson, and the fraudulent conspiracy entered into by the defendants for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff out of his right to such mine. The evidence was objected to and excluded on the ground that it did not show any legal title in the plaintiff, assuming its truth; that, in the courts of the United States, an action of ejectment was based upon the strict legal title, and if the plaintiff failed to show that it was in him, he must fail in such action. The defendants now contend that, if the plaintiff have any remedy, it is at law; and also that there is no cause of action stated in the bill. At the time of the trial of this suit, the ejectment action had not been decided by this court, the action having been here decided May 13, 1901. It must be regarded as determined by the decision in that case, that the complainant herein has no remedy at law, and, if he has none in this suit, he is without remedy for the gross fraud set out in the bill. All facts well pleaded in the bill are admitted by the demurrer, and the question, therefore, is whether the bill states facts sufficient to entitle him to relief in a court of equity.\n The court below has held that the bill does not state with sufficient certainty the time when plaintiff discovered the alleged fraud set forth in the bill, in that it does not appear by any certain averment that the plaintiff did not discover such fraud before the expiration of the ninety days after the discovery of the lode, in which to file a copy of the notice of location in the recorder's office, which, if he had done, he might, by himself filing the copy, have thereby fulfilled all the pro- \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n visions of the statute relating to the location and recording of the notice of claim. We entirely agree with the court below that the facts constituting the cause of action in equity must be distinctly alleged, so that the defendant may know what he has to meet, and so that he may, if he choose, put them in the issue. The rule must receive a reasonable interpretation, and must be so enforced as to further, and not obstruct, the administration of justice. We think the court below erred in holding that there was no sufficient averment as to the time of the discovery by plaintiff of the alleged fraud set forth in the bill, assuming such averment to have been necessary. He averred that Pilkey, acting under the agreement with plaintiff and Johnson, discovered the mine, and located the same by posting the requisite notice on the ground on the 10th of July, 1893. He also averred that some time about the 1st of October (the exact time, however, he could not state) the defendants entered into the conspiracy and combination referred to. This was but a few days before the expiration of the statutory time in which to file a copy of the notice of claim in the recorder's office of the county. He averred that the conspiracy and combination was secret, and that, while the plaintiff and his copartner Johnson were able and willing to comply with all the laws of the United States and territory, they failed to do so because of the wrongful, fraudulent, and unlawful acts of the defendants thereinafter mentioned. Those acts were a secret effacement of the work done by Pilkey, the taking down of the notice of claim posted on the ground by him, the failure to file a copy thereof, the posting of a claim on the part of the defendants, and the filing of a copy of such notice in the recorder's office on December 13, 1893\n\n\n We think the plain import of these averments is that the conspiracy and combination did not become known to the plaintiff until after the expiration of the ninety days from the discovery of the mine, in which to file a copy of the notice posted on the ground, in the recorder's office of the proper county. That is a sufficiently definite averment of time, and \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n it is enough to show that the failure to file a copy of the notice within the necessary time was owing to the action of the defendants.\n Under the agreement first mentioned between plaintiff, Johnson, and Pilkey, as copartners, it became the duty of Pilkey, in order to complete the location it was his duty to make, to file a copy of the notice in the recorder's office; and the parties to the agreement had the right to rely upon Pilkey to file the necessary copy for record; and it is plain that the failure to file on the part of the plaintiff was because of his ignorance of such failure on the part of Pilkey, consequent upon Pilkey's fraudulent conspiracy and agreement with the other defendants not to file it. After the discovery of the conspiracy, the plaintiff did procure a copy of the original notice posted by Pilkey on the ground, and filed the same in the office of the recorder on the 9th of December, 1893. Taking these allegations together, we think it hypercritical to hold that the bill does not, with sufficient distinctness, allege the fact that the plaintiff did not discover the fraud until after the expiration of the ninety days mentioned, and hence did not himself file the copy of the notice within that time.\n All pleadings must be construed reasonably, and not with such strictness as to refuse to adopt the natural construction of the pleading because a particular fact might have been more distinctly alleged, although its existence is fairly, naturally, and reasonably to be presumed from the averments made in the pleading.\n The agreement between the plaintiff, Pilkey, and Johnson shows it to have been the duty of Pilkey to make the necessary filing for record, in order to complete the location of the mine, which he, in the agreement, was to do. The plaintiff had the right to rely upon Pilkey carrying out that agreement, and fulfilling his duty thereunder by making the necessary filing; and plaintiff alleges that he would have done all things made necessary by law had it not been for this fraudulent combination and conspiracy on the part of the defendants. We \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n regard the allegations of the bill as sufficient in these particulars.\n Again, it is alleged that the bill prays that the location of what is called the Washington lode by the defendants be declared void, and that the plaintiff may have the possession of the claim; while the plaintiff now asks to have the defendants treated as constructive trustees, etc., which is inconsistent, as alleged, with the former prayer for relief. The bill contains a prayer for general relief in addition to the prayer for special relief, and under such prayer this relief may be given. It is objected that, under the prayer for general relief, no relief of that nature can be granted, inasmuch as it is opposed to the special relief asked for by the bill, and also because the general allegations in the bill do not justify such relief. All the facts upon which the plaintiff seeks relief from a court of equity are clearly stated in the bill. The facts constituting the fraud are set forth, and it is alleged that the parties doing the acts mentioned concealed them from the plaintiff for the purpose of defrauding plaintiff out of his interest and ownership in the mine. Having set out all the facts upon which the right to relief is based, the plaintiff asks specially for the possession, and also for the proceeds, of the mine, because, by reason of the facts, the location made by the defendants was a void location. Whether it was a void location or not was matter of law, arising from the facts appearing in the bill. Those facts were not changed in the slightest degree, nor were any inconsistent facts set up thereafter. The plaintiff now, under his prayer for general relief, contends that, although the location of the Washington lode by the defendants may have been so far valid as to create a title in the defendants, yet that, by reason of the fraud already distinctly set forth in the bill, the plaintiff was entitled to avail himself of that title, and to hold them as trustees ex maleficio, for his benefit.\n There is nothing in the intricacy of equity pleading that prevents the plaintiff from obtaining the relief under the general prayer, to which he may be entitled upon the facts plainly \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n stated in the bill. There is no reason for denying his right to relief, if the plaintiff is otherwise entitled to it, simply because it is asked under the prayer for general relief, and upon a somewhat different theory from that which is advanced under one of the special prayers. The cases of English v. Foxall, 2 Pet. 595, 7 L. ed. 531; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177, 9 L. ed. 388; Hobson v. M'Arthur, 16 Pet. 182, 10 L. ed. 930; Hayward v. Eliot Nat. Bank, \n96 U.S. 611\n, 24 L. ed. 855; Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 18 L. ed. 721, are not opposed to the views just stated.\n We agree that the relief granted under the prayer for general relief must be agreeable to the case made by the bill; and that, in substance, is what is held by the above cases. The case made by the bill consists of the material facts therein stated; and where all the facts are stated, it is no reason for denying relief under a general prayer, because it may differ from the theory of the law upon which the special prayer for relief is based, where both prayers are based upon the same facts, clearly set forth in the bill.\n The defendants contend that, if Pilkey, under the fraudulent agreement alleged, and pursuant thereto, surrendered possession to the defendants, the latter became cotenants with the plaintiff, and he could maintain an action at law to recover possession from his cotenants. We have already held that the plaintiff could not, upon the facts, maintain ejectment. When Pilkey surrendered possession to defendants unde this fraudulent agreement, and they entered and posted the notice and filed the copy, they did not enable plaintiff to maintain ejectment against them as upon his ouster of possession by defendants.\n Neither plaintiff nor Johnson had ever had anything but a constructive possession through the possession of Pilkey; and when he fraudulently surrendered it to the other defendants, and they entered and completed their location, the plaintiff could not then sustain ejectment, as we have already held. This is not in opposition to the case of Erhardt v. Boaro, \n113 U.S. 528\n, 28 L. ed. 1113, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560. The question whether the relief should be at law or in equity was not there raised. The action was commenced \n\n[195 U.S. 427, 438]\n\u00a0\n in Colorado, and was in accordance with the usual form in actions for mining claims under the procedure in Colorado, and was brought to recover possession of a mine. There was no discussion as to the forum. The complaint simply followed the usual practice. Here we have already held, in the ejectment suit (\n181 U.S. 516\n, 45 L. ed. 979, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665), that the relief is not to be had by ejectment, but must be obtained in equity if at all. Under the circumstances we think it immaterial whether Pilkey surrendered possession before or after the expiration of ninety days from the discovery of the mine, July 10, 1893. All the acts of fraud set up in the bill, committed by the defendants, are, if proved, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to treat them as trustees ex maleficio, and to recover from them, as such trustees, all the materials taken from the mine. See Saunders v. Mackey, 5 Mont. 523, 6 Pac. 361; Doherty v. Morris, 11 Colo. 12, 16 Pac. 911. Upon the case made by the bill, some of the defendants being insolvent, we think the plaintiff entitled to an injunction restraining the defendants from further mining during the pendency of the suit; an injunction to issue upon such security as may seem appropriate to the court below.\n We decide this case solely upon the questions raised by the demurrer.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of New Mexico and of the trial court must be reversed, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court, with directions to remand it to the District Court for the Second Judicial District of the Territory of New Mexico, within and for the county of Bernalillo, with directions to overrule the defendants' demurrer, and with leave to answer upon such terms as may seem proper to that court.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOWE v.

U S(1904)\nNo. 301\nArgued: December 2, 1903Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n The United States sued McCray for a statutory penalty of $50, alleging that, being a licensed retail dealer in oleomargarine, he had, in violation of the acts of Congress, knowingly purchased for resale a fifty- pound package of oleomargarine, artificially colored to look like butter, to which there was affixed internal revenue stamps at the rate of 4\/1 of a cent a pound, upon which the law required stamps at the rate of 10 cents per pound. The answer of McCray, whilst admitting the purchase of the package stamped as alleged, set up two defenses.\n First. It was averred that the oleomargarine in question was made by a duly licensed manufacturer, the Ohio Butterine Company, from a formula used by it in making a high grade oleomargarine composed of 'the following ingredients and none other, in these proportions; oleo oil, 20 pounds; natural lard, 30 pounds; creamery butter, 50 pounds; milk and cream, 30 pounds; common salt, 7 pounds.' It was asserted that whilst it was true that the oleomargarine made from the ingredients in question was of a yellow color, that this result was not caused by artificial coloration, but was solely occasioned by the fact that the butter, which was bought in open market, and used in making the oleomargarine, had a deep yellow color imparted to it (the butter) by a substance knows as Wells-Richardson's improved butter color. This preparation, it was averred, was not injurious to health, and was constantly used in the United States in the manufacture of butter made from pure milk or cream, for the purpose of imparting to it a deep yellow color. Averring that a yellow color produced in oleomargarine by the employment of butter, as an ingredient, which was artificially colored, did not amount to an artificial coloration of the oleomargarine within the meaning of the statute, it was asserted that the tax of 1\/4 of a cent per pound was a compliance with the law. \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n Second. If the act of Congress impoing the tax, when rightly construed, required stamps at the rate of 10 cents per pound upon oleomargarine, colored as described in the first defense, the act levying such tax was charged to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. As a foundation for this defense the answer contained the following averments:\n Whilst butter made from pure milk and cream in the spring season was of a deep yellow color, such butter when made at all other seasons was of a pale yellow; that the taste of consumers of butter in the United States required all butter to possess the deep color naturally belongint to butter made in the spring season, and hence it had come to pass that substantially all butter manufactured for sale in the United States, not made in the spring season, and not naturally of a deep yellow, was colored artificially so as to cause it to have the deep yellow of spring butter. It was alleged that this deep yellow coloration of natural butter was universally produced by the use of either Wells-Richardson's compound or some other coloring ingredient, which did not change the taste of the butter, none of which were injurious to health. Oleomargarine, it was alleged, derived its chief value as an article of food as a substitute for butter, and that growing out of the taste of the consumers, unless the olemargarine which was naturally white could be colored yellow, to present the appearance of butter artificially colored, there was no demand for it, and its manufacture and sale would be commercially impossible. It was then averred that to impose upon the colored oleomargarine a tax of 10 cents per pound would burden it with such a charge as to render it impossible to make and sell it in competition with butter, and therefore the result of imposing a tax of 10 cents a pound on oleomargarine when artificially colored would destroy the oleomargarine industry. From these averments it was charged that if the law imposed the tax of 10 cents upon the oleomargarine in question, the statute was repug- \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n nant to the Constitution, because it deprived the defendant of his property without due process of law; because the levy of such a burden was beyond the constitutional power of Congress, since it was an unwarranted interference by Congress 'with the police powers reserved to the several states and to the people of the United States by the Constitution of the United States;' and further, that said acts of Congress were repugnant to the Constitution, since they finally lodged in an executive officer the power to determine what constituted artificial coloration of oleomargarine, and therefore invested such officer with judicial authority; and, finally, because the attempt by Congress to levy a tax at the rate of 10 cents a pound arbitrarily discriminated against oleomargarine in favor of butter, to the extent of destroying the oleomargarine industry for the benefit of the butter industry, and was, therefore, violative of 'those fundamental principles of equality and justice which are inherent in the Constitution of the United States.'\n The government demurred to the answer on the ground that it stated no defense. The demurrer was sustained, and McCray electing to plead no further, the court found the facts alleged in the petition to be true, and adjudged that the government recover 'the sum of $50 as a penalty and costs.' Because of the questions arising under the Constitution, the case was then brought directly to this court.\nMessrs. Miller Outcalt, Charles E. Prior, William D. Guthrie, Francis J. Kearful, Delavan B. Cole, and Charles C. Carnahan for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 27, 37]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 27, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n As the controversy in every aspect involves the acts of Congress concerning the taxation of oleomargarine, a summary of those acts becomes essential.\n The original act was passed in 1886. (24 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 840, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2228.) The 1st section provided:\n'That for the purposes of this act the word 'butter' shall be understood to mean the food product usually known as butter, and which is made exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with or without common salt, and with or without additional coloring matter.'\n\n The 2d thus defined oleomargarine:\n'That for the purposes of this act certain manufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine,' namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, olemargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, vegetable oil, and annotto, and other coloring matter; intestinal fat and offal fat made in imitation of semblance of butter, or, when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter.'\n\n The 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th sections imposed \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 44]\n\u00a0\n a license on manufacturers and dealers in oleomargarine, and contained many requirements controlling the packing, marketing, and supervision of the manufacture and sale of the taxed article. The 8th section provided as follows:\n'That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured and sold, or removed for consumption or use, there shall be assessed and collected a tax of two cents per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; . . . The tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps, and the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this section.'\n\n The other provisions of the statute, not necessary to be noticed, contained many regulations looking to the enforcement and collection of the licenses and taxes which the act imposed. In 1902 further provisions were made on the subject, and the act of 1886 was, in many respects, expressly amended. (32 Stat. at L. 193, chap. 784.) The title of the act is--\n'An Act to Make Oleomargarine and Other Imitation Dairy Products Subject to the Laws of Any State er Territory or the District of Columbia into Which They Are Transported, and to Change the Tax on Oleomargarine, and to Impose a Tax, Provide for the Inspection, and Regulate the Manufacture and Sale of Certain Dairy Products, and to Amend an Act Entitled 'An Act Defining Butter, Also Imposing a Tax Upon and Regulating the Manufacture, Sale, Importation, and Exportation of Oleomargarine,' Approved August 2, 1886.'\n\n The 1st section provides that all-- 'oleomargarine, butterine, imitation, process, renovated, or adulterated butter, or imitation cheese, or any substance in the semblance of butter or cheese, not the usual product of the dairy, and not made exclusively of pure and unadulterated milk or cream, transported into any state or territory \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 45]\n\u00a0\n or the District of Columbia, and remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage therein, shall, upon the arrival within the limits of such state or territory or the District of Columbia, be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such state or territory or the District of Columbia . . . to the same extent and in the same manner as though such article or substances had been produced in such state or territory or the District of Columbia, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.'\n Section 2 amends  3 of the act of 1886 in particulars not necessary for the purposes of this case to be considered. Section 3 amends  8 of the act of 1886 by increasing the tax on oleomargarine from two (2) to ten ( 10) cents per pound, with this proviso: 'Provided, When oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be one-fourth of one cent per pound. The tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps; and the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for in this section.'\n Section 4 reiterates the definition of butter contained in the 1st section of the act of 1886, and besides gives a definition of 'adulterated butter,' 'process butter,' or 'renovated butter,' and imposes taxes upon the manufacture and sale of these articles, the tax upon adulterated butter being at the rate of 10 cents a pound.\n The section in question, as well as those following it, contains many administrative provisions for the enforcement of the taxes levied by the act, and concerning interstate and foreign commerce in the articles referred to. Bearing, then, the statutes in mind, we come to consider the assignments of error, which are as follows: \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 46]\n\u00a0\n 'The district court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the United States to the answer of plaintiff in error (defendant below).\n'The district court erred in refusing to hold that the act of Congress approved August 2, 1886, as amended by the act of Congress approved May 9, 1902, is in contravention of the Constitution of the United States of America, and of the amendments thereto, and is illegal and void, for the reasons:\n\n'(a) The act deprives the defendant of his property without due process of law.\n\n'(b) The act is an unwarranted encroachment upon, and an interference with, the police powers reserved to the several states and to the people of the United States.\n\n'(c) The act so arbitrarily discriminates against oleomargarine in favor of butter as to destroy the oleomargarine industry for the benefit of the butter industry of the United States, and is thus repugnant to those fundamental principles which are inherent in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'The district court erred in holding, if said act be not in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, that oleomargarine, which contains no artificial coloration than that imparted to it by the use of butter which itself contains coloring matter, and which therefore causes said oleomargarine to look like butter of a shade of yellow, is subject to a tax of 10 cents per pound instead of a tax of 1\/4 of 1 cent per pound.'\n\n It is to be observed that in the errors thus assigned no reference is made to the contention in the answer that the acts of Congress were void because conferring upon administrative officers the power to finally decide what constituted artificial coloration; such contention, therefore, may be put out of view. The errors relied upon embrace not only the contention that the act of Congress imposing the tax is repugnant to the Constitution, but also that the penalty was wrongfully enforced, because the one-quarter of a cent per pound which had been \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 47]\n\u00a0\n paid on the oleomargarine was the only tax to which it was liable under the act of Congress when rightly construed. As the presence of the constitutional question imposes upon us the duty of considering also the construction of the statute, we shall invert the order in which the errors have been assigned, and come to consider, first, whether the act of Congress, as properly construed, required on the oleomargarine in question a tax of 10 cents a pound; and, second, if it did, whether such act is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n 1st. The construction of the statute.\n Leaving out of view the proviso to the 8th section of the act of 1886 as amended and re-enacted by the 3d section of the act of 1902, it is beyond question that a tax of 10 cents a pound is imposed upon oleomargarine. As the product was admitted by the answer to be oleomargarine, it follows that it was subject to the tax of 10 cents a pound, unless, by the proviso, the oleomargarine was of such a character as to entitle it to the benefits of a lower rate of taxation. Now the proviso reads: 'Provided, When oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be one-fourth of one cent per pound.' As it was admitted that the oleomargarine was of a shade of yellow causing it to look like butter, and as it was also admitted that this shade of yellow had been imparted by an artificial coloring matter used to color the butter which formed one of the ingredients from which the oleomargarine was manufactured, it results, if the text of the statute be applied, that the oleomargarine was not within the proviso, because it was not free from artificial coloring matter causing it to look like butter. This necessarily follows, since the right to enjoy the lower rate of tax is made by the proviso to depend upon whether, as a matter of fact, the oleomargarine was free from artificial coloring matter, and not upon the mere method adopted for imparting the artificial color. As the oleomargarine in question was in fact not free from artificial col- \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 48]\n\u00a0\n oration, we think that a construction which would take it out of the general rule imposing the 10 cent tax upon all oleomargarine, and bring it within the exception embracing only oleomargarine free from artificial coloration, would be not an interpretation of the statute, but a disregard of its unambiguous provisions.\n But it is contended that, as  2 of the act of 1886 defined oleomargarine, for the purposes of that act, to be 'certain manufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter,' and as not only the act of 1886, but the act of 1902, defined butter, for the purposes of those acts, to mean 'the food product usually known as butter, and which is made exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with or without common salt, and with or without additional coloring matter,' therefore colored oleomargarine produced by using, as one of the ingredients of its manufacture, butter artificially colored, must be treated as free from artificial coloration within the meaning of the act of 1902, and the deduction made is that, as the statute treats butter, both with or without artificial coloration, as a legitimate ingredient of oleomargarine, the use of an authorized ingredient did not cause the manufactured product to be other than oleomargarine within the statute. But the proposition goes further, and asserts that because butter, whether artificially colored or not, was an authorized ingredient of oleomargarine, therefore the finished product, in which either of these ingredients was used, was not only oleomargarine, but necessarily also was oleomargarine free from artificial coloration. This is an obvious non sequitur. As the benefit of the lower tax depended upon the absence from the manufactured product of artificial coloration, it follows that if, in the manufacture, an authorized ingredient, which was artificially colored, was used so as to artificially color the product, whilst that product would be oleomargarine, it could not be oleomargarine free from artificial coloration within the intendment of the proviso. Nor is there force in the contention that the \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 49]\n\u00a0\n plain meaning of the statute is overcome by an amendment to which it was subjected. Before the amendment relied on, the proviso read as follows: provided, When oleomargarine is free from coloration or ingredient that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be one-fourth of one cent per pound.' By the amendment the word ingredient was stricken out, thus leaving the proviso in the form in which it was enacted. The proposition is that the elimination of the word 'ingredient' compels to the conclusion that wherever artificial coloration in the finished product of oleomargarine was produced by artificial coloration used in an authorized ingredient, that such coloration was not artificial within the statute. But this disregards the fact that butter, both when artificially colored and when not so colored, was made an authorized ingredient of oleomargarine. If, then, the word 'ingredient' had not been stricken out, it might have given rise to the contention that the imparting of a yellow color to the finished product of oleomargarine by the use in its manufacture of spring butter of a natural yellow color would have caused the product oleomargarine to be artificially colored within the statute. As the manufacturer of oleomargarine was permitted to use either butter not artificially colored or butter so colored, the effect of striking out the word 'ingredient' operated simply to render it certain that the finished product, even although of a yellow color, would be within the proviso where the color was imparted by an authorized ingredient not artificially colored. This overthrows the contention that the finished product, when not free from artificial coloration, must be treated as free from such coloration, because the color was derived from an artificially colored, though authorized, ingredient. We think, whilst the statute recognized the right of a manufacturer to use any or all of the authorized ingredients so as to make oleomargarine, and also authorized, as one of the ingredients, butter artificially colored, if the manufacturer elected to use such ingredient last mentioned, and thereby gave to \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 50]\n\u00a0\n his manufactured product artificial coloration, such product so colored, although being oleomargarine, was not within the exception created by the proviso, and therefore came under the general rule subjecting oleomargarine to the tax of 10 cents a pound.\n Nor do the other provisions of the act of 1902, as it is asserted, sustain the contention that artificially colored oleomargarine is to be treated as free from such coloration, because such color was imparted in its manufacture by the use of an artificially colored and authorized ingredient. The provision principally depended upon is  2 of the act of 1902, which provides that any person who 'sells, vends, or furnishes oleomargarine for the use and consumption of others, except to his own family table, without compensation, who shall add to or mix with such oleomargarine any artificial coloration, . . . shall also be held to be a manufacturer of oleomargarine . . .' But this section relates only to the adding to or mixing artificial coloration with oleomargarine after its manufacture, and therefore does not even remotely support the proposition that where, in the process of manufacture, oleomargarine becomes artificially colored, it must be held not to be what it in fact is,-that is, must be treated as free from artificial coloration, although such in fact is not the case.\n Indeed, the context of the statutes, particularly the provisions as to adulterated and renovated butter in the act of 1902, harmonize with and thus add cogency to the construction which we have given to the provision concerning artificial coloration.\n 2d. Did Congress, in passing the acts which are assailed, exert a power not conferred by the Constitution?\n That the acts in question on their face impose excise taxes which Congress had the power to levy is so completely established as to require only statement. Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 619\n, 46 L. ed. 719, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 U.S. 509\n, 43 L. ed. 786, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522; Re Kollock, \n165 U.S. 536\n, 41 L. ed. 816, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 444. \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 51]\n\u00a0\n The last case referred to (Re Kollock) involved the act of 1886, and the court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said (p. 536, L. ed. p. 816, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 447):\n'The act before us is, on its face, an act for levying taxes, and although it may operate in so doing to prevent deception in the sale of oleomargarine as and for butter, its primary object must be assumed to be the raising of revenue.'\n\n We might rest the answer to the contention as to the want of power in Congress to enact the laws in question upon the foregoing cases. But in view of the earnestness with which the validity of the acts are assailed in argument, and the assertion that the necessary effect of the amendment to the act of 1886 by the act of 1902 is to make both of the laws in question so peculiar as to cause them to be beyond the reach of the previous rulings of this court, we propose to review and dispose of the propositions pressed upon us at bar as indubitably demonstrating that the acts in question were beyond the power of Congress to adopt.\n The summary which follows embodies the propositions contained in the assignments of error, and the substance of the elaborate argument by which those assignments are deemed to be sustained. Not denying the general power of Congress to impose excise taxes, and conceding that the acts in question, on their face, purport to levy taxes of that character, the propositions are these:\n\n\n (a)\n That the power of internal taxation which the Constitution confers on Congress is given to that body for the purpose of raising revenue, and that the tax on artificially colored oleomargarine is void because it is of such an onerous character as to make it manifest that the purpose of Congress in levying it was not to raise revenue, but to suppress the manufacture of the taxed article.\n\n\n (b)\n The power to regulate the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine being solely reserved to the several states, it follows that the acts in question, enacted by Congress for the purpose of suppressing the manufacture and sale of oleo- \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 52]\n\u00a0\n margarine, when artificially colored, are void, because usurping the reserved power of the states, and therefore exerting an authority not delegated to Congress by the Constitution.\n\n\n (c)\n Whilst it is true-so the argument proceeds-that Congress, in exerting the taxing power conferred upon it, may use all means appropriate to the exercise of such power, a tax which is fixed at such a high rate as to suppress the production of the article taxed is not a legitimate means to the lawful end, and is therefore beyond the scope of the taxing power.\n\n\n (d)\n As the tax levied by the acts which are assailed discriminates against oleomargarine artificially colored, and in favor of butter so colored, and creates an unwarranted and unreasonable distinction between the oleomargarine which is artificially colored and that which is not, and as the necessary operation and effect of the tax is to suppress the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine, and to aid the butter industry, therefore the acts are void. And with this proposition in mind it is insisted that wherever the judiciary is called upon to determine whether a power which Congress has exerted is within the authority conferred by the Constitution, the duty is to test the validity of the act, not merely by its face, or, to use the words of the argument, 'by the label placed upon it by Congress,' but by the necessary scope and effect of the assailed enactment.\n\n\n (e)\n Admitting that the power to tax, as delegated to Congress by the Constitution as originally adopted, was subject to no limitation except as expressed in that instrument, the amendments to the Constitution, it is urged, have imposed limitations on the taxing power not expressed in the original Constitution. Under this assumption it is insisted that the acts in question are void, because the burdens which they impose are repugnant to both the 5th and 10th Amendments. To the 5th Amendment, because the amount of the tax is so out of proportion to the value of the property taxed as to destroy that property, and thus amount to a taking \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 53]\n\u00a0\n thereof without due process of law. To the 10th Amendment, because the necessary operation and effect of the acts is to destroy the oleomargarine industry, and thus exert a power not delegated to Congress, but reserved to the several states.\n\n\n (f)\n Although, as a general rule, it be ture that the power of Congress to tax, conferred by the Constitution, is unlimited, except as otherwise expressed in that instrument, and conceding, for the sake of the argument, that there is no express limitation either in the original Constitution or in the amendments thereto, by which the acts may be decided to be unconstitutional, nevertheless, it is urged that, as the burdens which the acts impose are so onerous and so unjust as to be confiscatory, the acts are void, because they amount to a violation of those fundamental rights which it is the duty of every free government to protect.\n It is clear that these propositions in many respects not only reiterate in different forms of expression the same contention, but that they also so intermingle considerations which require separate analysis as to cause it to be difficult to precisely determine their import. For instance, all of the propositions obviously rest not only on inferences drawn from the face of the acts, but also on deductions made from what it is assumed must have been the motives or purposes of Congress in passing them. To avoid confusion and repetition we shall consider these distinct contentions separately, and we hence come, first, to ascertain how far, if at all, the motives or purposes of Congress are open to judicial inquiry in considering the power of that body to enact the laws in question. Having determined the question of our right to consider motive or purpose, we shall then approach the propositions relied on by the light of the correct rule on the subject of purpose or motive.\n Whilst, as a result of our written constitution, it is axiomatic that the judicial department of the government is charged with the solemn duty of enforcing the Constitution, \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 54]\n\u00a0\n and therefore, in cases properly presented, of determining whether a given manifestation of authority has exceeded the power conferred by that instrument, no instance is afforded from the foundation of the government where an act which was within a power conferred, was declared to be repugnant to the Constitution, because it appeared to the judicial mind that the particular exertion of constitutional power was either unwise or unjust. To announce such a principle would amount to declaring that, in our constitutional system, the judiciary was not only charged with the duty of upholding the Constitution, but also with the responsibility of correcting every possible abuse arising from the exercise by the other departments of their conceded authority. So to hold would be to overthrow the entire distinction between the legislative, judicial, and executive departments of the government, upon which our system is founded, and would be a mere act of judicial usurpation.\n It is, however, argued, if a lawful power may be exerted for an unlawful purpose, and thus, by abusing the power, it may be made to accomplish a result not intended by the Constitution, all limitations of power must disappear, and the grave function lodged in the judiciary, to confine all the departments within the authority conferred by the Constitution, will be of no avail. This, when reduced to its last analysis, comes to this: that, because a particular department of the government may exert its lawful powers with the object or motive of reaching an end not justified, therefore it becomes the duty of the judiciary to restrain the exercise of a lawful power wherever it seems to the judicial mind that such lawful power has been abused. But this reduces itself to ths contention that, under our constitutional system, the abuse by one department of the government of its lawful powers is to be corrected by the abuse of its powers by another department.\n The proposition, if sustained, would destroy all distinction between the powers of the respective departments of the gov- \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 55]\n\u00a0\n ernment, would put an end to that confidence and respect for each other which it was the purpose of the Constitution to uphold, and would thus be full of danger to the permanence of our institutions. As aptly said by the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, in Kilborn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168, 190\n, 26 S. L. ed. 377, 386:\n'It is believed to be one of the chief merits of the American system of written constitutional law, that all the powers intrusted to governments, whether state or national, are divided into the three grand departments,-the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. That the functions appropriate to each of these branches of government shall be vested in a separate body of public servants, and that the perfection of the system requires that the lines which separate and divide these departments shall be broadly and clearly defined. It is also essential to the successful working of this system that the persons intrusted with power in any one of these branches shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to the others, but that each shall, by the law of its creation, be limited to the exercise of the powers appropriate to its own department, and no other.'\n\n It is, of course, true, as suggested, that if there be no authority in the judiciary to restrain a lawful exercise of power by another department of the government, where a wrong motive or purpose has impelled to the exertion of the power, that abuses of a power confended may be temporarily effectual. The remedy for this, however, lies, not in the abuse by the judicial authority of its functions, but in the people, upon whom, after all, under our institutions, reliance must be placed for the correction of abuses committed in the exercise of a lawful power. This was aptly pointed out in Champion v. Ames, \n186 U.S. 321\n, 47 L. ed. 492, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321, where, speaking through Mr. Justice Harlan, it was said ( p. 363, L. ed. p. 504, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 329):\n'But if what Congress does is within the limits of its power, and is simply unwise or injurious, the remedy is that suggested by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden [9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 23], when \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 56]\n\u00a0\n he said: 'The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments.\"\n\n The decisions of this court from the beginning lend no support whatever to the assumption that the judiciary may restrain the exercise of lawful power on the assumption that a wrongful purpose or motive has caused the power to be exerted. As we have previously said: from the beginning no case can be found announcing such a doctrine, and, on the contrary, the doctrine of a number of cases is inconsistent with its existence. As quite recently pointed out by this court in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 60\n, 44 S. L. ed. 969, 977, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, the often quoted statement of Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland [ 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L. ed. 579], that the power to tax is the power to destroy, affords no support whatever to the proposition that where there is a lawful power to impose a tax its imposition may be treated as without the power because of the destructive effect of the exertion of the authority. And this view was clearly pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in the passage from Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 23, which was repeated in the passage from the opinion in Champion v. Ames, previously cited.\n And the same doctrine has been again and again expounded. In the License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 463, 18 L. ed. 497, referring to the extensive power of taxation possessed by Congress, and the express limitations found in the Constitution, it was said (p. 471, L. ed. p. 500):\n'It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very extensive power. It is given in the Constitution, with only one exception, and only two qualifications. Congress cannot tax exports, and it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule of uniformity. Thus limited, and thus only, it reaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion.' \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 57]\n\u00a0\n In Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 19 L. ed. 95, referring to the unlimited nature of the power of taxation conferred upon Congress, it was observed (p. 443, L. ed. p. 98):\n\n'Congress may prescribe the basis, fix the rates, and require payment as it may deem proper. Within the limits of the Constitution it is supreme in its action. No power of supervision or control is lodged in either of the other departments of the government.'\n\n And after referring to the express limitations as to uniformity and articles exported from any state, it was remarked (p. 446, L. ed. p. 98):\n'With these exceptions, the exercise of the power is, in all respects, unfettered.'\n\n In Austin v. Boston, 7 Wall. 694, 19 L. ed. 224, it was again declared (p. 699, L. ed. p. 226) 'that the right of taxation, where it exists, is necessarily unlimited in its nature. It carries with it inherently the power to embarrass and destroy.'\n Yet again, in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 19 L. ed. 482, where a tax levied by Congress on the circulating notes of state banks was assailed on the ground that the tax was intended to destroy the circulation of such notes, and was, besides, the exercise of a power to tax a subject not conferred upon Congress, it was said, as to the first contention (p. 548, L. ed. p. 487):\n'It is insisted, however, that the tax in the case before us is excessive, and so excessive as to indicate a purpose on the part of Congress to destroy the franchise of the bank, and is, therefore, beyond the constitutional power of Congress.\n\n'The first answer to this is that the judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative department of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons, but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its members are elected. So, if a particular tax bears heavily upon a corporation, or a class of corporations, it cannot, for that reason only, be pronounced contrary to the Constitution.' \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 58]\n\u00a0\n True it is, as argued, that the opinion in that case rested the conclusion not alone upon the doctrine just quoted, but also upon the principle that Congress possessed the power to suppress the circulation of the notes of state banks as an incident to the authority concerning the currency delegated to Congress by the Constitution. But whilst this argument may weaken the authoritative force of the statement made in the case in question as to the want of power in the judiciary to examine into motive, it does not affect the persuasive and inherent force of the reasoning by which that view was sustained. Besides, the doctrine has since been affirmed.\n\n In Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 355\n, 31 L. ed. 767, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 926, speaking through Mr. Justice Gray, it was said:\n'In the words of Chief Justice Chase, condensing what had been said long before by Chief Justice Marshall, 'The judicial department cannot prescribe to the legislative department limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons; but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its members are elected.\"\n\n In Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, the cases which have been referred to were approvingly cited, and the doctrine which they expressed was restated.\n In Treat v. White, \n181 U.S. 264\n, 45 L. ed. 853, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611, referring to a stamp duty levied by Congress, it was observed (p. 268, L. ed. p. 855, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 613):\n'The power of Congress in this direction is unlimited. It does not come within the province of this court to consider why agreements to sell shall be subject to the stamp duty, and agreements to buy not. It is enough that Congress, in this legislation, has imposed a stamp duty upon the one, and not upon the other.'\n\n In Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n, 46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, considering another stamp duty levied by Congress, it was again said ( p. 623, L. ed. p. 720, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 499):\n'That it is no part of the function of a court to inquire into the reasonableness of the excise, either as respects the amount, or the property upon which it is imposed.' \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 59]\n\u00a0\n It being thus demonstrated that the motive or purpose of Congress in adopting the acts in question may not be inquired into, we are brought to consider the contentions relied upon to show that the acts assailed were beyond the power of Congress, putting entirely out of view all considerations based upon purpose or motive\n\n\n 1. \nUndoubtedly, in determining whether a particular act is within a granted power, its scope and effect is to be considered. Applying this rule to the acts assailed, it is self-evident that on their face they levy an excise tax. That being their necessary scope and operation, it follows that the acts are within the grant of power. The argument to the contrary rests on the proposition that, although the tax be within the power, as enforcing it will destroy or restrict the manufacture of artificially coleored oleomargarine, therefore the power to levy the tax did not obtain. This, however, is but to say that the question of power depends, not upon the authority conferred by the Constitution, but upon what may be the consequence arising from the exercise of the lawful authority.\n Since, as pointed out in all the decisions referred to, the taxing power conferred by the Constitution knows no limits except those expressly stated in that instrument, it must follow, if a tax be within the lawful power, the exertion of that power may not be judicially restrained because of the results to arise from its exercise. The proposition now relied upon was urged in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and was overruled. In that case it was insisted that, although death duties were within the power to levy excise taxation, as the effect of their extreme enforcement would involve the power to destroy the right to the passage or receipt of property on the occasion of death,-a subject within the exclusive control of the states,-therefore death duties, when imposed by Congress, must be held to be unconstitutional. In considering this contention, after referring to the statement of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in M'Culloch v. Maryland, that the power to tax involves the power to destroy, it was observed (p. 60, L. ed. p. 977, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 755): \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 60]\n\u00a0\n 'This principle is pertinent only when there is no power to tax a particular subject, and has no relation to a case where such right exists. In other words, the power to destroy, which may be the consequence of taxation, is a reason why the right to tax should be confined to subjects which may be lawfully embraced therein, even although it happens that in some particular instance no great harm may be caused by the exercise of the taxing authority as to a subject which is beyond its scope. But this reasoning has no application to a lawful tax, for if it had there would be an end of all taxation; that is to say, if a lawful tax can be defeated because the power which is manifested by its imposition may, when further exercised, be destructive, it would follow that every lawful tax would become unlawful, and therefore no taxation whatever could be levied.'\n Of course, where a state law is assailed as repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and on its face such act was seemingly within the power of the state to adopt, but its necessary effect and operation is to usurp a power granted by the Constitution to the government of the United States, it must follow, from the paramount nature of the Constitution of the United States, that the act is void. In such a case the result of the test of necessary operation and effect is to demonstrate the want of power, because of the controlling nature of the limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States on the states.\n And without attempting to review the numerous authorities cited in the argument, it suffices to say that we think it is apparent that they fall within one or the other of the categories just previously stated.\n\n 2. \nThe proposition that where a tax is imposed which is within the grant of powers, and which does not conflict with any express constitutional limitation, the courts may hold the tax to be void because it is deemed that the tax is too high, is absolutely disposed of by the opinions in the cases hitherto cited, and which expressly hold, to repeat again the language \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 61]\n\u00a0\n of one of the cases (Spencer v. Merchant) that 'The judicial department cannot prescribe to the legislative department limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons; but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its members are elected.'\n\n 3. \nWhilst undoubtedly both the 5th and 10th Amendments qualify, in so far as they are applicable, all the provisions of the Constitution, nothing in those amendments operates to take away the grant of power to tax conferred by the Constitution upon Congress. The contention on this subject rests upon the theory that the purpose and motive of Congress in exercising its undoubted powers may be inquired into by the courts, and the proposition is therefore disposed of by what has been said on that subject.\n The right of Congress to tax within its delegated power being unrestrained, except as limited by the Constitution, it was within the authority conferred on Congress to select the objects upon which an excise should be laid. It therefore follows that, in exerting its power, no want of due process of law could possibly result, because that body chose to impose an excise on artificially colored oleomargarine, and not upon natural butter artificially colored. The judicial power may not usurp the functions of the legislative in order to control that branch of the government in the performance of its lawful duties. This was aptly pointed out in the extract heretofore made from the opinion in Treat v. White, \n181 U.S. 264\n, 45 L. ed. 853, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n Bur it is urged that artificially colored oleomargarine and artificially colored natural butter are in substance and in effect one and the same thing, and from this it is deduced that to lay an excise tax only on oleomargarine artificially colored, and not on butter so colored, is violative of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, because, as there is no possible distinction between the two, the act of Congress was a mere arbitrary imposition of an excise on the one article, and not on the other, although essentially of the same class. Conceding, merely for \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 62]\n\u00a0\n the sake of argument, that the due process clause of the 5th Amendment would avoid an exertion of the taxing power which, without any basis for classification, arbitrarily taxed one article and excluded an article of the same class, such concession would be wholly inapposite to the case in hand. The distinction between natural butter artificially colored, and oleomargarine artificially colored so as to cause it to look like butter, has been pointed out in previous adjudications of this court. Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 U.S. 238\n, 46 L. ed. 171, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 120, and authorities there cited. Indeed, in the cases referred to, the distinction between the two products was held to be so marked, and the aptitude of oleomargarine when artificially colored, to deceive the public into believing it to be butter, was decided to be so great, that it was held no violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment was occasioned by state legislation absolutely forbidding the manufacture, within the state, of oleomargarine artificially colored. As it has been thuse decided that the distinction between the two products is so great as to justify the absolute prohibition of the manufacture of oleomargarine artificially colored, there is no foundation for the proposition that the difference between the two was not sufficient, under the extremest view, to justify a classification distinguishing between them.\n\n 4. \nLastly we come to consider the argument that, even though as a general rule a tax of the nature of the one in question would be within the power of Congress, in this case the tax should be held not to be within such power, because of its effect. This is based on the contention that, as the tax is so large as to destroy the business of manufacturing oleomargarine artificially colored to look like butter, it thus deprives the manufacturers of that article of their freedom to engage in a lawful pursuit, and hence, irrespective of the distribution of powers made by the Constitution, the taxing laws are void, because they violate those fundamental rights which it is the duty of every free government to safeguard, and which, therefore, should be held to be embraced by im- \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 63]\n\u00a0\n plied, though none the less potential, guaranties, or, in any event, to be within the protection of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n Let us concede, for the sake of argument only, the premise of fact upon which the proposition is based. Moreover, concede, for the sake of argument only, that even although a particular exertion of power by Congress was not restrained by any express limitation of the Constitution, if, by the perverted exercise of such power, so great an abuse was manifested as to destroy fundamental rights which no free government could consistently violate, that it would be the duty of the judiciary to hold such acts to be void upon the assumption that the Constitution, by necessary implication, forbade them.\n Such concession, however, is not controlling in this case. This follows when the nature of oleomargarine, artificially colored to look like butter, is recalled. As we have said, it has been conclusively settled by this court that the tendency of that article to deceive the public into buying it for butter is such that the states may, in the exertion of their police powers, without violating the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, absolutely prohibit the manufacture of the article. It hence results, that even although it be true that the effect of the tax in question is to repress the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine, it cannot be said that such repression destroys rights which no free government could destroy, and, therefore, no ground exists to sustain the proposition that the judiciary may invoke an implied prohibition, upon the theory that to do so is essential to save such rights from destruction. And the same considerations dispose of the contention based upon the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. That provision, as we have previously said, does not withdraw or expressly limit the grant of power to tax conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. From this it follows, as we have also previously declared, that the judiciary is without authority to avoid an act of Congress exerting the taxing power, even in a case where, to the judicial mind, \n\n[195 U.S. 27, 64]\n\u00a0\n it seems that Congress had, in putting such power in motion, abused its lawful authority by levying a tax which was unwise or oppressive, or the result of the enforcement of which might be to indirectly affect subjects not within the powers delegated to Congress.\n Let us concede that if a case was presented where the abuse of the taxing power was so extreme as to be beyond the principles which we have previously stated, and where it was plain to the judicial mind that the power had been called into play, not for revenue, but solely for the purpose of destroying rights which could not be rightfully destroyed consistently with the principles of freedom and justice upon which the Constitution rests, that it would be the duty of the courts to say that such an arbitrary act was not merely an abuse of a delegated power, but was the exercise of an authority not conferred. This concession, however, like the one previously made, must be without influence upon the decision of this cause for the reasons previously stated; that is, that the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine may be prohibited by a free government without a violation of fundamental rights.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Brown, and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCINTIRE v. MCINTIRE(1904)\nNo. 84\nArgued: December 8, 1903Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 116, 117]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William G. Johnson for Charles McIntire.\n Messrs. Charles Cowles Tucker, William Henry Dennis, and Henry E. Davis for Edwin A. McIntire et al.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are cross appeals from the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. See 14 App. D. C. 337. To avoid all questions of form there are also writs of error on the same grounds. The appeal of Charles McIntire is from the overruling of exceptions to the final account of the administrator with the will annexed of the estate of David McIntire, and presents two \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n questions, one of construction and one of administration, outside the terms of the will. The probate of the will already has been before this court. \n162 U.S. 383\n, 40 L. ed. 1009, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 814.\n The question of construction is the main one. It is whether the children of the testator's brothers, Edwin and Charles, take per capita or per stirpes under the residuary clause of the following will:\n January 7th, 1880\n\n\n This is my last will and testament.\n I david McIntire, tin-plate worker, of this city (of) do will, bequeath, or devise, to my nephews, and nieces, that is to say, from July the first. 1st eighteen hundred and fifty-four. 1854.\n To the opening of. on reading of this, paper. one thousand three hundred and fifty dollars and sixty-four cents ($1,350.64) is to be calculated at six (6) per cent. interest\n That amount whatever it may be is to be given to each of my brother Edwin's children. The remainder if any, is to be equally divided between my Brothers Edwin and Charles children. David McIntire.\n There was an addition and also an earlier document of January 1, 1880, which it is unnecessary to copy. At the date of the will the brother Charles was living and had two sons, Charles and Henry, the latter of whom died before the testator. The brother Edwin had died, leaving six children, one of whom died before the testator. The testator held promissory notes of his brother Charles for $1,350.63. The brother Charles also now is dead.\n The argument for a division per stirpes is this. Earlier in the paper the testator had used the phrase 'nephews and nieces,' which it would have been natural to repeat had he intended to make a division per capita. But instead of that he says 'my brothers Edwin and Charles children,' which is not very different from 'my brother Edwin's children and my brother Charles' children,' and orders an equal division 'between' them. 'Between,' if accurately used, imports that not more \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n than two persons or groups are set against each other (Ihrie's Estate, 162 Pa. 369, 372, 29 Atl. 750; Records v. Fields, 155 Mo. 314, 322, 55 S. W. 1021), and those groups are earmarked and shown to be regarded as groups by naming the parents from which respectively they come. The equality of division is an equality between the groups. See Hall v. Hall, 140 Mass. 267, 271, 2 N. E. 700. This mode of distribution has the recommendation that it follows the rule in cases of intestacy. Raymond v. Hillhouse, 45 Conn. 467, 474, 29 Am. Rep. 688. See, further, Alder v. Beale, 11 Gill & J. 123, explained in Plummer v. Shepherd, 94 Md. 466, 470, 51 Atl. 173. But the court is of opinion that the general rule of construction must prevail, according to which, in the case of a gift to the children of several persons described as standing in a certain relation to the testator, the objects of the gift take per capita, and not per stirpes. Walker v. Griffin, 11 Wheat. 375, 379, 6 L. ed. 498, 499; Balcom. v. Haynes, 14 Allen, 204; Hill v. Bowers, 120 Mass. 135. The fact that one of the parents was living at the date of the will is deemed sufficient to exclude a reference to the statute of distributions. Blackler v. Webb, 2 P. Wms. 383; Bryant v. Scott, 21 N. C. (1 Dev. & B. Eq.) 155, 157, 28 Am. Dec. 590. And with regard to the word 'between,' the will is an illiterate will, and as the popular use of the word is not accurate no conclusion safely can be based upon that. See Maddox v. State, 4 Harr. & J. 539; Brittain v. Carson, 46 Md. 186; Lord v. Moore, 20 Conn. 122; Pitney v. Brown, 44 Ill. 363; Farmer v. Kimball, 46 N. H. 435, 439, 88 Am. Dec. 219; Burnet v. Burnet, 30 N. J. Eq. 595; Myres v. Myres, 23 How. Pr. 410; Waller v. Forsythe, 62 N. C. (1 Phill. Eq.) 353.\n The other error assigned on behalf of Charles McIntire is that the court charged the estate with $11,500, fees paid to counsel for services in defending the will against the attack of the said Charles and his father. The amount was paid in different sums by orders of court, in several instances on the petition of the children of Edwin, one of whom was the administrator with the will annexed, and was directed to be charged against the interest of those children in the first instance, but without prejudice to an application to have it finally charged \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n against the interest of those children in the account it was charged against the estate. We are of opinion that the charge was proper. There is no contest over the amount. It was the proper business and duty of the administrator to defend the will, and he was entitled to a reasonable allowance for what he had to pay in doing so. The only just alternative would be to charge counsel fees as costs against the losing party, which would have been less favorable to the appellant. The general proposition is not disputed, but it is said that in this case the legatees retained the counsel and therefore ought to pay them. The other legatees as well as the administrator no doubt had a share in calling the counsel in. But that did not matter. The services were services to the estate in maintaining the testator's will; they were adopted by the administrator, and the usual rule must prevail. It is said that there was no application to change the original order, and no chance to be heard against it. But plainly this cannot be true. As observed by the court below, allowing the account changed the order and charged the fees on the estate. Whatever want of formality there may have been, the appellant had the right and opportunity to object and except to the account, as well on this ground as others, and he used it. The precise mode in which the allowance appeared upon the account is not material, but may be explained in a word or two. The payments were made by the solicitors of the parties while they had the assets in their hands, as will be stated in a moment. They rendered their account, crediting themselves with those payments generally. Then they turned over the assets, less these payments and their commissions, to the administrator. In the account of the latter he charges himself only with the net amount received by him, and makes no charge for the counsel fees against the legatees, and thus throws the burden on the residue of the estate.\n The foregoing considerations dispose of the appeal of Charles \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n McIntire. There is a cross appeal by the administrator from the allowance of certain exceptions to the account. The first error assigned is that he was denied commissions. The reason was this. On February 19, 1885, pending the controversy on the will and other controversies, an order was made by consent of all parties, to the effect among other things, that Edwin A. McIntire should act as administrator, 'but without any allowance for commission or other charge for his services as such administrator,' and that the assets should remain under the control of the court (they having been paid into court under another order of the same date, passed in an equity cause). The next year, all debts having been paid except a disputed note, another order was made by consent, turning over the assets to the solicitors of the parties. The funds were managed by the solicitors until the will was established, when, on petition of the administrator, offering to give an additional bond, the assets were put into his hands on July 7, 1896, upon his filing a bond for $100,000. It is argued that this restoration of the assets to the hands of the administrator, with the duty of distribution and the requirement of a new bond, relieved him of the terms of the bargain on which it was agreed that he should act, if that bargain ever was valid. We think it enough to say that we perceive no such change of situation from what was anticipated as should have that result. Whether the bargain was good or bad, the services were rendered under it, and therefore purported to be gratuitous. The law does not forbid gratuitous services, even in fiduciary relations, and if acts purport to be done gratuitously no claim for payment can be founded upon them at a later date. See Johnson v. Kimball, 172 Mass. 398, 400, 401, 52 N. E. 386.\n A partial distribution was made under an order of December 9, 1897, of $2,800 to each of the children of Edwin, and of $6,022.02 to Charles McIntire. Complaint is made because the sums paid to Edwin's children were charged against the legacies to them instead of against their share in the residue, whereas the payment to Charles was charged to his share in \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 124]\n\u00a0\n the residue, which was all he had. It is said that this mode stops the running of interest on the legacies, to the disadvantage of the legatees. But we see no ground for complaint. Of course, the liabilities of the estate in the form of legacies as well as those in the form of debts are to be satisfied before the residue exists. In the absence of a definite understanding at the time, partial payments naturally would be taken as working that satisfaction and as stopping the liability of the estate for interest. The same principle applies to another sum which four of the legatees agreed to treat as having been paid to them as stated below.\n A third error alleged concerns $500, part of the counsel fees in addition to the sums mentioned above. This was paid upon a petition of Edwin's children, stating that the counsel 'had been managing their interests,' and under an order directing the same to be charged to their distributive shares, without reserving any right to apply to have it finally charged to the estate. We are not disposed to overturn the decision that this payment must be borne by the legatees, as they were content to be charged with it in the order allowing the payment.\n The next error assigned is that the administrator was charged with interest on an item of $10,000 from April 18, 1884, to February 25, 1885. This sum was alleged to have been received by the administrator, and improperly omitted from the inventory. The matter was referred to arbitrators. In order to avoid a family quarrel, if possible, the four sisters of the administrator agreed to be charged with $2,500 each, as on a partial distribution, and gave receipts on February 25, 1885. Thereupon the administrator requested the arbitrators to find that he received and must account for the sum, and they did so. Very probably the matter of interest was overlooked, but the result of the transaction is that the administrator stands charged on the record as owing the estate $10,000 until the time of distribution to the sisters, and of course that he must pay interest at the legal rate. It is not a case of charging interest not earned against an administrator having funds in his \n\n[192 U.S. 116, 125]\n\u00a0\n hands as such, but it is a charge against him for money which he ought to have put into his account and held as an identified fund, but did not. The motives which induced his consent to charge himself are immaterial. Whatever they were, the effect of the record is the same.\n Finally, the administrator objects to being charged with interest on an item of $1,419.73, which he received in 1891. There is, perhaps, more doubt about this than concerning the more important matters, but we shall not disturb the decree. The assets had been ordered to be paid into court and then had been transferred, as above stated, to the solicitors of the parties as custodians. The administrator did not pay this sum over, but kept it in his own hands.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMETROPOLITAN R CO v. MACFARLAND(1904)\nNo. 16\nArgued: October 24, 1904Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n\n Upon this record the Metropolitan Railroad Company seeks, both by appeal and writ of error, to obtain a review of the action of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming an order of the supreme court of the District, which \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n order sustained an award against the company, contained in the verdict of a jury, rendered in condemnation proceedings, under an act of Congress. 31 Stat. at L. 668, chap. 810. The statute referred to is entitled, 'An Act Authorizing and Requiring the Metropolitan Railroad Company to Extend Its Lines on Old Sixteenth Street.' Briefly, the act authorized and required the company to extend its lines over the streets to which the act referred, and, for the purpose of enabling this to be done, directed the commissioners of the District to commence the necessary proceedings to acquire the land needed for the widening of the streets. It was directed that the condemnation proceedings should be commenced in the supreme court of the District, upon notice, under the supervision of the court, to all interested parties. A jury of seven was directed to be empaneled by the court, and this jury, after organizing and viewing the premises, were to 'proceed, in the presence of the court, if the court shall so direct, or otherwise, as the court may direct, to hear and receive such evidence as may be offered or submitted on behalf of the District of Columbia, and by any person or persons having any interest in the proceedings for the extension of said street.' The act required the jury to return a written verdict fixing the amount of damages sustained by the lot owners by reason of the taking of their property for the widening of the streets, and also to ascertain and fix the benefits which would result from the work, not only to the lot owners, but to the Metropolitan Railroad Company, and the sum of the benefits was directed to be assessed against the railroad company and the lot owners. Power was conferred upon the court to hear any objections which might be made to the verdict, and to set it aside in whole or in part if the court were satisfied that it was unjust or unreasonable.\n Section 13 of the act is as follows:\n'Sec. 13. That no appeal by any interested party from the decision of the supreme court of the District of Columbia confirming the assessment or assessments for benefits or damages herein provided for, nor any other proceedings at law or \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n in equity by such party against the confirmation of such assessment or assessments, shall delay or prevent the payment of the award to others in respect to the property condemned nor the widening of such streets: Provided, however, That upon the final determination of said appeal or other proceeding at law or in equity, the amount found to be due and payable as damages sustained by reason of the widening of the streets under the provisions hereof shall be paid as hereinbefore provided.'\n\n The transcript before us shows that in July, 1900, the commissioners of the District instituted the proceedings in condemnation, required by the act, and that, among others, the Metropolitan Railroad Company was made a party. A jury having been empaneled, they were directed by the court to view the premises, and, outside of the presence of the court, to hear such evidence as might be produced by the interested parties, and to return their verdict to the court. Soon afterwards the railroad company filed an answer praying that it might be dismissed from the proceedings, because the act of Congress requiring the company to extend its lines was unconstitutional, and because the company could not be made liable for any assessment for benefits conferred upon it by the proposed work, as it owned no property in the District embraced by the improvement. Immediately following the answer of the railroad company is set out what purports to be instructions asked by the railroad company to be given by the court to the jury. Each of these instructions is marked by the clerk as filed on a named date, and below each instruction, unaccompanied by any certificate from a judge, is the statement, 'Rejected, with permission to present later.' Following these papers is what purports to be a notice on behalf of the railroad company that, on a given day, it would present a request to the court for the giving of the refused instructions as well as of others; and the paper in question, as also the instructions referred to in it, are marked filed by the clerk on a date named, and below some of the instructions, without any \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n certificate whatever by the judge, is a recital, 'Rejected, and exception by the Railroad Company,' or 'Granted, and exception by D. C. and also by G. F. Williams, on behalf of certain property owners.'\n The transcript shows that the jury returned a verdict to the court, fixing the damages and benefits, and that there was assessed against the railroad company, for benefits, the sum of $25,000. A rule nisi was entered to confirm the verdict, and the railroad company filed the following exceptions:\n'The Metropolitan Railroad Company excepts to the finding, assessment, and award against it for alleged benefits to it from the proposed widening and extension of the said Columbia road and Sixteenth street, and for cause or ground of exception shows:\n\n'1. That the said finding, assessment, and award are without evidence to support the same.\n\n'2. That the said finding, assessment, and award are contrary to the evidence.\n\n'3. That the said finding, assessment, and award are contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n\n'4. For errors of law in the instructions given and refused by the court to the jury, over the objection and exception of the Metropolitan Railroad Company, before the said finding, assessment, and award were made, as shown by the record of the said cause.'\n\n After the filing of these exceptions the transcript shows that a paper was filed by the clerk, which is styled 'Petition of Metropolitan R. R. Co., to make of record testimony as to the benefits to Metropolitan Railroad Company.' In this petition it is recited that the evidence before the jury was taken outside of the presence of the court, and that the only testimony before the jury on the subject of the benefits to the railroad company, as shown by affidavits annexed to the petition, was that of James B. Lackey, which was reduced to writing by a stenographer. The court was asked to allow the affidavits and deposition to be filed as part of the record, 'the \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n same being essential to the hearing and determination of this respondent's exceptions to said award, filed in this cause, and it being impossible for this respondent properly to defend its rights in the premises without, in some way, causing the said evidence, and the fact that it was the only evidence in the case upon the question of said benefits to this respondent, to appear of record.' Upon this petition the following indorsement is shown: 'Let the within petition be filed. A. B. Hagner, Justice.' The transcript then sets out what purports to be the affidavits and testimony of Lackey, referred to in the petition.\n It is also shown that, upon a subsequent date, the supreme court of the District, after due notice to all interested parties, and after hearing arguments of counsel upon the exceptions to the verdict, overruled the exceptions, and entered a final decree confirming the award and assessment as found by the jury, except in a minor particular, which need not be noticed. There is nothing in the transcript showing that any exception was reserved to the overruling of the objections to the award interposed by the company, and no bill of exceptions is shown to have been allowed by the judge. Immediately at the foot of the final decree appears the following:\n'And from so much of the above decree as overrules its exceptions and confirms the verdict, award, and assessment against it, the Metropolitan Railroad Company appeals in open court, and the penalty of the appeal bond is fixed by the court at $100.\n\n'A. B. Hagner, Asso. Justice.'\n\n Next follows a stipulation signed by the attorneys for the District and for the railroad company as to what should constitute the transcript of record for the purposes of the appeal of the Metropolitan Railroad Company. Item 11 reads as follows:\n'Petition of Metropolitan Railroad Co. to make of record certain testimony, and allowance of same, filed November 24, 1900. \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n 'Motion to vacate order on said petition.'\n\n The motion last referred to, however, does not appear in the transcript.\n On the appeal of the railroad company the court of appeals affirmed the order appealed from (20 App. D. C. 421), and from its action in so doing the railroad company prayed, and was allowed, an appeal to this court. About a month afterwards the attorney for the railroad company filed in said court of appeals a motion in the cause, reading as follows:\n'And now comes the appellant, by its counsel, and shows to the court that because of the fact that the record in this cause contains what may possibly be considered a bill of exceptions, it may be that the proper remedy would be held to be a writ of error instead of an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. It therefore prays that this honorable court, in addition to the appeal which was granted to it to the Supreme Court of the United States in this cause on the 24th day of October, 1902, it may also be allowed a writ of error to said court, and that the supersedeas bond required upon said appeal may also be taken and accepted as a supersedeas bond upon said writ of error.'\n\n An entry appears in the transcript of the allowance of a writ of error, the filing of a bond conditioned for the prosecution both of the appeal and writ of error, and the transcript contains citations, as well on the writ of error as on the appeal, signed by the chief justice of the court of appeals. The consolidated proceeding, by appeal and writ of error, is the one which is now here for review.\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington and C. C. Cole for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Edward H. Thomas and Andrew B. Duvall for appellees and defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White: \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Assuming that the matters complained of are susceptible of review by this court, the first question is whether our jurisdiction is dependent upon the appeal or the writ of error.\n That a proceeding involving the exercise of the power of eminent domain is essentially but the assertion of a right legal in its nature has been determined. So, also, the decisions of this court have settled that a condemnation proceeding initiated before a court, conducted under its supervision, with power to review and set aside the verdict of the jury, and with the right of review vested in an appellate tribunal, is, in its nature, an action at law. Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367, 376\n, 23 S. L. ed. 449, 452; Searl v. School Dist. No. 2, \n124 U.S. 197\n, 31 L. ed. 415, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 460; Chappell v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 499, 513\n, 40 S. L. ed. 510, 515, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397.\n The proceedings provided for in the act of June 6, 1900, being of this character, it is, we think, manifest that the jurisdiction of this court can be exercised only by writ of error.\n When both the proceeding by appeal and that by writ of error were allowed, the jurisdiction of this court to review the judgments and decrees of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia was regulated by  233 of the Code of the District of Columbia. 31 Stat. at L. 1227, chap. 854. In effect that section was but a re-enactment of the then existing provisions of the 8th section of the act of February 9, 1893 [27 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 74, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573], which act established the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. By said section of the Code the power of this court to review by writ of error or appeal the judgments or decrees of said court of appeals, excluding certain exceptional and enumerated cases, is limited to cases where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum of $5,000; and such power to review is to be exerted only in the same manner and under the same regulations as theretofore prevailed before the organization of the court of appeals in cases \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia.\n Now, as it is settled by the authorities previously referred to that the proceeding in question was legal in its nature, and not one of equitable cognizance, and as it has also been settled that the jurisdiction of this court prior to the act of 1893, to review the final judgments or decrees of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, did not give power to review by appeal a matter not of equitable cognizance ( Ormsby v. Webb, \n134 \nU.S. 47, 64\n, 33 S. L. ed. 805, 812, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478 ), it necessarily follows that we are without jurisdiction to review the action of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia on the appeal here taken, and that appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.\n Thus disposing of the appeal, we come to consider the case on the writ of error. The errors assigned in the brief of counsel are as follows:\n'The court below erred in sustaining the trial court:\n\n'1st. In refusing to set aside the assessment because not supported by the evidence, and because contrary to the same and the weight thereof.\n\n'2d. In refusing to instruct the jury that no assessment could be made against it as a corporation, but only against such of its property, if any, as might be benefited.\n\n'3d. In refusing to instruct the jury that no assessment of benefits could be made against appellant.'\n\n In view of the condition of the record as disclosed by the statement of the case which we have made, we are of opinion that we cannot pass upon the errors embraced by these assignments.\n The inability so to do results from the fact that there is no bill of exceptions in the record showing that the supreme court of the District of Columbia was asked to and refused to give the alleged instructions upon which the second and third assignments of error depend, nor does it appear, from a bill of exceptions or in any other appropriate mode, upon what the supreme court of the District of Columbia acted \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 330]\n\u00a0\n in considering the exception expressly stated to be based upon the evidence. Not only this, but there is nothing of record exhibiting the fact that any exception was duly taken to the action of the court in overruling the objections urged by the railroad company to the confirmation of the verdict of the jury.\n True it is that the transcript contains what purport to be certain instructions asked and refused, marked filed by the clerk. True also is it that there is in the printed transcript a petition and other papers concerning the evidence given before the jury, to which we have referred in the statement of the case. And it is also true that there is in the printed transcript an agreement between counsel, reciting that the court allowed the prayer of the petition. But, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, allowed and authenticated by the judge, these documents form no part of the record in this court, which we have alone the right to consider in determining the merits of the errors assigned. Young v. Martin, 8 Wall. 357, 19 L. ed. 419; Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Sixth Presby. Church, \n91 U.S. 127\n, 23 L. ed. 260; Clune v. United States, \n159 U.S. 593\n, 40 L. ed. 270, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 125; Nelson v. Flint, \n166 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1002, 1003, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576.\n In Young v. Martin, where entries had been made by the clerk in his minutes, stating the filing of a demurrer, argument thereon, and overruling of the demurrer, and that exception had been taken by plaintiff, it was held that the exception was not available. The court said (p. 356, L. ed. p. 419):\n'These entries do not present the action of the court and the exceptions in such form that we can take any notice of them. It is no part of the duty of the clerk to note in his entries the exceptions taken, or to note any other proceedings of counsel, except as they are preliminary to, or the basis of, the orders or judgment of the court.'\n\n It may be observed in passing that whilst it is not now necessary to seal a bill of exceptions (Rev. Stat.  953, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 696), the other requisites referred to are essential.\n In Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Sixth Presby. \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 331]\n\u00a0\n Church, -a case similar in character to that under review,-the court said ( pp. 130, 131, L. ed. p. 261):\n'Neither depositions nor affidavits, though appearing in the transcript of a common-law court of errors, can ever be regarded as a part of the record unless the same are embodied in an agreed statement of facts, or are made so by a demurrer to the evidence, or are exhibited in a bill of exceptions.\n\n ... * *\n'Exceptions may be taken by the opposite party to the introduction of depositions or affidavits; and the party introducing such evidence in a subordinate court may insist that the court shall give due effect to the evidence, and, in case of refusal to comply with such a request, may except to the ruling of the court, if it be one prejudicial to his rights. Where neither party excepts to the ruling of the court, either in respect to its admissibility or legal effect, the fact that such a deposition or affidavit is exhibited in the transcript is not of the slightest importance in the appellate court, as nothing of the kind can ever constitute the proper foundation for an assignment of error. Suydam v. Williamson, 20 How. 433, 15 L. ed. 980.\n\n'Inquisitions like the present one bear a strong analogy in many respects to the report or award of referees appointed under a rule of court, to whom is referred a pending action. Referees in such cases make their report to the court; and in such a case the report, unlike an award at common law, must be confirmed before the prevailing party is entitled to the benefit of the finding of the referees. When the report is filed in court the losing party may file objections in writing to the confirmation of the report, and may introduce evidence in support of the objections; and it is well-settled law that the ruling of the court in overruling such objections is the proper subject of a bill of exceptions. York & C. R. Co. v. Myers, 18 How. 250, 15 L. ed. 382.'\n\n In Clune v. United States, in the course of the opinion the court said (\n159 U.S. 593\n, 40 L. ed. 270, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126): \n\n[195 U.S. 322, 332]\n\u00a0\n 'Finally, there is a claim of error in the instructions, but the difficulty with this is that they are not legally before us. True, there appears in the transcript that which purports to be a copy of the charge, marked by the clerk as filed in his office among the papers in the case; but it is well settled that instructions do not in this way become part of the record. They must be incorporated in a bill of exceptions, and thus authenticated by the signature of the judge. This objection is essentially different from that of the lack or the sufficiency of exceptions. An appellate court considers only such matters as appear in the record. From time immemorial that has been held to include the pleadings, the process, the verdict, and the judgment, and such other matters as, by some statutory or recognized method, have been made a part of it.'\n That parties, by their affidavits or agreements, cannot cause that to become a bill of exceptions which is not such in a legal sense, is settled. Nelson v. Flint, \n166 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1002, 1003, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Malony v. Adsit, \n175 \nU.S. 281, 285\n, 44 S. L. ed. 163, 165, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115, and cases cited.\n As it results that the record before us does not exhibit error, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia must be, and it is, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINN. & ST. LOUIS R. R. CO. v. MINNESOTA(1904)\nNo. 138\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. Albert E. Clarke for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Howard H. Dunn, W. B. Douglas, and Lafayette French for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 53, 59]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding in mandamus to compel plaintiff in error to build and maintain a station house on the line of its road at the village of Emmons, in compliance with an order of the Railroad & Warehouse Commission of the state of Minnesota.\n The order of the commission was made upon petition and upon hearing after due notice to plaintiff in error. The writ was granted by the district court of Freeborn county, where the proceedings were commenced.\n The railroad company in its answer attacks the statute under which the commission acted as follows:\n'This respondent says further, that chapter 270, General Laws 1901, approved April 13, 1901, which was enacted by the legislature of said state at its thirty-second session, which arbitrarily requires railroad carriers to provide freight and passenger rooms and depots at all villages and boroughs upon their respective roads, without regard to the necessity therefor and without regard to the location or situation of such village or boroughs, or to existing conditions, is unjust, unreasonable, contrary to public policy, and void.\n\n'It denies to the respondent the right to reasonably manage or control its own business; it takes its property without its consent.\n\n'It takes the property of this respondent arbitrarily and unnecessarily, \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 60]\n\u00a0\n for public use, without just compensation, and is, therefore, violative of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'It deprives the respondent of its property without due process of law, and denies it the equal protection of the laws, and thus violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment of the district court, the members of the court equally dividing on the facts.\n This is the second attempt of the village of Emmons to secure a depot. The first was unsuccessful (76 Minn. 469, 79 N. W. 510, 'wherein the facts are stated'), the supreme court observed; and it further observed, passing on the case at bar:\n'Mr. Associate Justice Lovely having been of counsel for the village in the former proceeding, was disqualified from sitting at the hearing of this appeal, and the cause was necessarily argued and submitted to the four remaining members of the court. We assume that Laws 1901, chapter 270, which, in express terms, requires railway companies to build and maintain depots or station houses in all villages through which their roads may pass, is in itself valid legislation, and not open to the objection that it is not within the legislative power to enact such a law. With this assumption no dispute has arisen over a construction of the act, to the effect that all incorporated villages within this state located on railway lines are prima facie entitled to depots. The commissioners have the power to order the erection and maintenance of depot buildings unless it is made to appear that such an order would be so unreasonable in its terms as to actually result in depriving the company proceeded against of its property without due process of law. The change made by the statute of 1901 simply affects or shifts the burden of proof; for, prior to its enactment, the burden was on the municipality to establish the reasonableness and necessity of a depot therein, while now a railway company appearing before the commissioners, or trying its case on appeal to the district court, bears the burden of showing that such a requirement is not called for, and that \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 61]\n\u00a0\n the building and maintenance of a depot in the village is unnecessary and unreasonable.\n\n'But, while agreeing as to this interpretation of the law, we fail to reach the same conclusion in respect to the facts. We do not question the correctness of the conclusion reached when considering the former appeal. But two members of the court, Chief Justice Start and Associate Justice Brown, are of the opinion that, from the evidence, it appears that there has since been a substantial growth in the village,-a growth which makes an altogether different showing,-and that the company did not overcome the prima facie case arising by virtue of the statute, and therefore that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. Associate Justices Collins and Lewis are unable to agree to this. Their conclusion is that the testimony fails to show that there has been a real or substantial change in the village, its needs or necessities, that the situation is practically as it was when the former proceeding was considered, and that the prima facie case made by the village has been wholly overcome by the defendant company.\n\n'With this difference of opinion the judgment appealed from must be, and hereby is, affirmed.' [87 Minn. 195, 91 N. W. 465.]\n\n The defendant in error contends by those observations the court only decided, following its former decision (76 Minn. 469, 79 N. W. 510), that under chapter 6,  388, General Statutes of 1894, the commission had the power to order the erection and maintenance of depots where public necessity or convenience reasonably required it to be done, and that the only change made by the act of 1901 was to shift the burden of proof from the municipality to the railroad company, and therefore the court, in deciding that the railroad company had not overcome the prima facie case arising from the statute, did not decide a Federal question.\n It is difficult to deal with the motion on account of the uncertainty of the contentions of plaintiff in error. In its answer in the district court it directly attacks the statute. In this court its contentions are not so sweeping and we are left in doubt by its opening and reply briefs whether the statute as construed by the supreme court is objected to or only its application \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 62]\n\u00a0\n under the facts of the case. However, as the statute was directly attacked in the answer the motion to dismiss is denied, and we will consider whether the grounds of objection to the statute are substantial and sufficient.\n\n\n (1)\n The act of 1897 provided as follows:\n'That all railroad corporations or companies operating any railroad in this state shall . . . provide at all villages and boroughs on their respective roads depots with suitable waiting rooms for the protection and accommodation of all passengers patronizing such roads, and a freight room for the storage and protection of freight. . . . Such railroad corporations or companies shall, at such depots or stations, stop their trains regularly as at other stations, to receive and discharge passengers, and, for at least one half hour before the arrival, and one half hour after the arrival, of any passenger train, cause their respective depots or waiting rooms to be open for the reception of passengers; said depots to be kept well lighted and warmed for the space of time aforesaid.'\n\n In its first opinion (76 Minn. 469, 79 N. W. 510), the court held that the word 'villages,' in the act meant incorporated villages, and that Emmons was not incorporated. The court, however, proceeded further, and said:\n'But there is no doubt of the power of the commissioners, under the general railroad and warehouse commission act, to require a railroad company to provide a suitable depot and passenger waiting room at any place, incorporated or unincorporated, where public necessity or convenience reasonably requires it to be done. But this power is neither absolute nor arbitrary. The facts must be such, having regard to the interests, not only of the particular locality, but also of the public at large and of the railroad company itself, as to justify the commissioners, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion and judgment, in ordering the railway company to provide a depot and passenger station at the place in question. Counsel for the relators admit this. The only evidence being the report of the commissioners themselves, we must refer to it to ascertain whether the facts therein stated reasonably justified their order requiring the railroad company to provide and \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 63]\n\u00a0\n maintain a depot and station at Emmons. The statute provides that, 'upon the trial of said cause [before the court, as in this case, to enforce the order of the commissioners], the findings of fact of said commission as set forth in its report shall be prima facie evidence of the matters therein stated.' (Gen. Stat. 1894,  399.)'\n\n The court then reviewed the facts, and decided that the order of the commission establishing a station at Emmons was unreasonable. The act was amended in 1901, and the court in the case at bar has decided, as we have seen, the amendment has only shifted the burden of proof. In other words, to quote from the opinion of the court, 'incorporated villages within this state (Minnesota) located on railway lines are prima facie entitled to depots,' and at a hearing before the commissioners and in the district court the railroad has the burden of showing that the establishment of a depot is unreasonable and unnecessary.\n The statute, as thus construed, does not transcend the power of the state. In other words, and meeting exactly the contention of plaintiff in error, the statute does not deny plaintiff in error the right to reasonably manage or control its property or arbitrarily take its property without its consent or without compensation or due process of law. Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. To establish stations at proper places is the first duty of a railroad company. The state can certainly provide for the enforcement of that duty. An incorporated village might be said to be such a place without an express declaration of the statute. To make it prima facie so by statute and to impose the burden of meeting the presumption thence arising, certainly does not amount to an invasion of the rights of property or an unreasonable control of property. This seems to be conceded in the reply brief of plaintiff in error. Counsel say:\n'The power of the state to require the construction and maintenance of stations at proper points is not questioned. We concede it. The power to require an unnecessary and wholly useless expenditure of money, in the construction and \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 64]\n\u00a0\n maintenance of stations where they are not needed, is denied. That is the whole case.'\n\n And stating the decision of the court in 76 Minn. counsel quotes as follows:\n'The commissioners have the power to order the erection and maintenance of depot buildings, unless it is made to appear that such an order is so unreasonable in its terms as to actually result in depriving the company proceeded against of its property without due process of law.'\n\n And counsel adds: 'This is, of necessity, a Federal question.'\n Whether it is or not, and whether it is so dependent on the facts of the case as not to be open to our review, is the next ground to be considered.\n\n\n (2)\n The charge is that the property of plaintiff in error is taken without due process of law; but whether so taken is made to depend upon a question of fact,-the requirement of 'an unnecessary and wholly useless expenditure of money.' It is well established that on error to a state court this court cannot re-examine the evidence, and when the facts are found we are concluded by such finding. Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300. But in the case at bar we are met by the circumstance that the supreme court equally divided on the question whether the facts distinguish this case from 76 Minn. The plaintiff in error, therefore, contends that there has been no judgment of the supreme court on the facts, and they are open to review here. The contention is not tenable. There is no statement of facts by the supreme court, and its decision, though by a divided court, constituted an affirmance of the finding of the district court. The finding was as follows:\n'That the respondent railroad company has no depot or station house whatever for the accommodation of the public upon its line of railroad at the village of Emmons, and that its line of road is the only railroad reaching such village.\n\n'That there is a suitable location for a depot or station house upon respondent's right of way at the point referred to and described in the order of the board of railroad and warehouse \n\n[193 U.S. 53, 65]\n\u00a0\n commissioners herein, which order is hereto attached. That it is necessary for the accommodation of the citizens of Emmons and vicinity, and the public at large, and public necessity requires that the respondent railroad company build and maintain a suitable station house at the said village of Emmons for the accommodation of the public transacting business with the respondent at that point.'\n\n The finding, like the verdict of a jury, is conclusive in this court. Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 38 L. ed. 305, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452. It follows that the order of the Warehouse Commission was not an unreasonable requirement, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K. & T.R. CO. OF TEXAS v. MAY(1904)\nNo. 185\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. James Hagerman, T. S. Miller, and J. M. Bryson for plaintiff in error. \n\n[194 U.S. 267, 268]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action to recover a penalty of $25, \n\n[194 U.S. 267, 269]\n\u00a0\n brought by the owner of a farm contiguous to the railroad of the plaintiff in error, on the ground that the latter has allowed Johnson grass to mature and go to seed upon its road. The penalty is given to contiguous owners by a Texas statute of 1901, chap. 117, directed solely against railroad companies for permitting such grass or Russian thistle to go to seed upon their right of way, subject, however, to the condition that the plaintiff has not done the same thing. The case is brought here on the ground that the statute is contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is admitted that Johnson grass is a menace to crops, that it is propagated only by seed, and that a general regulation of it for the protection of farming would be valid. It is admitted also that legislation may be directed against a class when any fair ground for the discrimination exists. But it is said that this particular subjection of railroad companies to a liability not imposed on other owners of land on which Johnson grass may grow is so arbitrary as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. There is no dispute about general principles. The question is whether this case lies on one side or the other of a line which has to be worked out between cases differing only in degree. With regard to the manner in which such a question should be approached, it is obvious that the legislature is the only judge of the policy of a proposed discrimination. The principle is similar to that which is established with regard to a decision of Congress that certain means are necessary and proper to carry out one of its express powers. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L. ed. 579. When a state legislature has declared that, in its opinion, policy requires a certain measure, its action should not be disturbed by the courts under the 14th Amendment, unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others whom it leaves untouched.\n Approaching the question in this way we feel unable to say that the law before us may not have been justified by local \n\n[194 U.S. 267, 270]\n\u00a0\n conditions. It would have been more obviously fair to extend the regulation at least to highways. But it may have been found, for all that we know, that the seed of Johnson grass is dropped from the cars in such quantities as to cause special trouble. It may be that the neglected strips occupied by railroads afford a ground where noxious weeds especially flourish, and that whereas self-interest leads the owners of farms to keep down pests, the railroad companies have done nothing in a matter which concerns their neighbors only. Other reasons may be imagined. Great constitutional provisions must be administered with caution. Some play must be allowed for the joints of the machine, and it must be remembered that legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts. Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer concurs in the judgment.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court in this case. While fully conceding that the legislature is the only judge of the policy of a proposed discrimination, it is not the only judge of its legality. Doubtless great weight will be given to its judgment in that regard, and the legislation will not be held invalid if it be founded upon a real distinction in principle between persons or corporations of the same class. Upon this principle spark arresters may be required upon locomotives when they are not required upon other smokestacks, because of their greater liability to communicate fires to adjoining property; so, although other proprietors are not bound to fence their lands, railway companies may be required to do so to prevent the straying of cattle upon their tracks. Upon the same principle gates and guards may be required at railway crosings when the same would be entirely unnecessary at the crossing of ordinary highways. Other discriminating regula- \n\n[194 U.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n tions made necessary by the peculiar business and danger incident to railway transportation may be readily imagined.\n In this case, however, the railway is not pursued as such, but merely as the proprietor of certain land alongside its track, and no reason can be conjectured why an obnoxious form of weed growing upon its land, should be more detrimental than the same weed growing upon adjoining lands. The railway is not made the sole object of the statutory prohibition by reason of the fact that it is a railway, and the discrimination against it seems to be purely arbitrary. The only distinction suggested in support of the ordinance is that the seed of Johnson grass may be dropped from the cars in such quantities as to cause special trouble; but there is not only no evidence of such fact, but it is highly improbable that the seed of a noxious grass of this kind would be carried upon the cars at all. It is also suggested that the self-interest of owners of farms to keep down pests of this kind might be relied upon to prevent their growth. But this tends merely to show that if the law were made general, it would be more readily obeyed by private land proprietors than by the railway. It may be that railways are less given to the observance of precautions required of them as neighborhood landowners than the proprietors of individual property, but that does not create a distinction in principle. It merely tends to show that if the law were made general the railway companies would be oftener prosecuted than other proprietors. If Johnson grass growing upon railway tracks be a nuisance, it is equally so when growing upon the other side of the line fence, and I think the law should be made general, to avoid the charge of an arbitrary discrimination. If the land owned by every corporation were held to this liability, while the land of individuals were exempt, the discrimination would be more conspicuously unjust in its appearance, but scarcely more so in its reality.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna also dissented. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORRIS v. HITCHCOCK(1904)\nNo. 272\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n This is an equity suit, begun in the supreme court of the Distrit of Columbia by Edwin T. Morris and nine other persons, all averred to be citizens of the United States, and not Indians, against Ethan A. Hitchcock, as Secretary of the Department of the Interior, William A. Jones, as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, J. George Wright, as Indian inspector, and J. Blair Shoenfelt, as United States Indian agent, resident at the city of Muscogee, in the Indian territory. Certain of the complainants were averred to be residents either of the state of Texas or of the state of Missouri, and others were averred to be residents of the Indian territory.\n It was alleged that each complainant was the owner in his own right of not less than 500 head of cattle and horses, of the value of not less than $15 per head, which were grazing upon land in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian territory, under contracts with individual members of said tribe, holding such lands as their approximate shares \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 385]\n\u00a0\n upon allotments to be made. The purpose of the suit was to obtain a decree perpetually enjoining said defendants from seizing, molesting, or removing the cattle and horses of plaintiffs from the Indian territory, as it was averred they threatened to do under the pretended authority of an act of the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior, which were averred to be repugnant to the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The statute and regulations referred to are copied in the margin. \n Regulations (June 3, 1902) Governing the Introduction by Noncitizens of Live Stock in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory.\n Section 29 of the act of Congress, approved June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517), ratifying the agreement with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, Indian territory, provides in part as follows:\n'It is further agreed that no act, ordinance, or resolution of the council of either the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribes, in any manner affecting the land of the tribe, or of the individuals, after allotment, or the moneys or other property of the tribe or citizens thereof (except appropriations for the regular and necessary expenses of the government of the respective tribes), or the rights of any persons to employ any kind of labor; or the rights of any persons who have taken or may take the oath of allegiance to the United States, shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States. When such acts, ordinances, or resolutions, passed by the council of either of said tribes, shall be approved by the governor thereof, then it shall be the duty of the national secretary of said tribe to forward them to the President of the United States, duly certified and sealed, who shall, within thirty days after their reception, approve or disapprove the same. Said acts, ordinances, or resolutions, when so approved, shall be published in at least two newspapers having a bona fide circulation in the tribe to be affected thereby, and when disapproved shall be returned to the tribe enacting the same.\n\n'It is further agreed, in view of the modification of legislative authority and judicial jurisdiction herein provided, and the necessity of the continuance of the tribal governments so modified, in order to carry out the requirements of this agreement, that the same shall continue for the period of eight years from the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.'\n\n Under these provisions, the following act of the Chickasaw national council, approved by the governor on May 3, 1902, was approved by the President of the United States on May 15, 1902, and entitled: \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 386]\n\u00a0\n The bill of complaint was demurred to upon the grounds following: (a) Want of jurisdiction in equity because of ade- \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 387]\n\u00a0\n quate right to relief at law; (b) defect of necessary parties, in that neither the Chickasaw Nation or tribe, or any mem- \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 388]\n\u00a0\n ber or representative thereof, was joined as a defendant; and (c) want of equity.\n After argument, the court overruled the first and second grounds of demurrer, and sustained the third ground. The complainants elected to stand upon their bill of complaint, and a decree was consequently entered, dismissing the bill. On appeal, the decree was affirmed by the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. 21 App. D. C. 565. The cause was then brought to this court.\n Messrs. Jackson H. Ralston, Frederick L. Siddons, and Davis & Garnett for appellants.\n Assistant Attorney General Campbell and Mr. A. C. Campbell for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n We think the court below was right in holding that the first and second grounds of demurrer were not well taken, but do not think it necessary to review the subject, as the opinion which we have reached on the merits of the case will dispose of the entire controversy.\n The act of Congress approved June 28, 1898, commonly known as the Curtis act (30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517), under which the act of the Chickasaw Nation and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior which are assailed were adopted, is entitled 'An Act for the Protection of the People of the Indian Territory and for Other Purposes.' The question of the validity and construction of that act was under consideration in Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 U.S. 445\n, 43 L. ed. 1041, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722, and Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 294\n, 47 L. ed. 183, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115, and in view of the rulings in those cases the constitutionality of the statute is not now open to question.\n While it is unquestioned that, by the Constitution of the United States, Congress is vested with paramount power to \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 389]\n\u00a0\n regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, yet it is also undoubted that in treaties entered into with the Chickasaw Nation, the right of that tribe to control the presence within the territory assigned to it of persons who might otherwise be regarded as intruders has been sanctioned, and the duty of the United States to protect the Indians 'from aggression by other Indians and white persons, not subject to their jurisdiction and laws,' has also been recognized. Treaty June 22, 1855, arts. 7 and 14 (11 Stat. at L. 611); Treaty April 28, 1866, art. 8 (14 Stat. at L. 769). And it is not disputed that, under the authority of these treaties, the Chickasaw Nation has exercised the power to attach conditions to the presence within its borders of persons who might otherwise not be entitled to remain within the tribal territory.\n Legislation of the same general character as that embodied in the act of the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation, here assailed as invalid, had been enacted by the Chickasaw Nation before the passage of the Curtis act. The essential provisions of one such law, passed on October 17, 1876, were recited in a report made to the Senate by the committee on the judiciary, on February 3, 1879, from which we copy the following:\n'The law in question seems to have a twofold object,-to prevent the intrusion of unauthorized persons into the territory of the Chickasaw Nation, and to raise revenue. By its terms no citizen of any state or territory of the United States can either rent land or procure employment in the Chickasaw country without entering into a contract with a Chickasaw, which contract the latter is to report to the clerk of the county where he resides, and a permit must be obtained for a time not longer than twelve months, for which the citizen is to pay the sum of $25.\n\n'Every licensed merchant, trader, and every physician, not a Chickasaw, is required to obtain a permit, for which the sum of $25 is exacted.'\n\n Declaring in substance that under the existing treaties with the tribe the Chickasaws were not prohibited from excluding \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 390]\n\u00a0\n from the territory of the nation the persons affected by the act, the committee expressed the opinion that the act which was the subject of the report was not invalid.\n Again, on December 14, 1898, the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation passed an act which, in  2, with some exemptions mentioned in a proviso, imposed the following permit taxes:\n'Sec. 2. That any noncitizen who owns horses, jacks, jennets, mules, or other cattle, and who holds them upon the public domain or within the Chickasaw Nation, shall be required to pay an annual permit tax of 25 cents per head for each horse, jack, or jennet, mule, or bovine, and 5 cents per head for each sheep and goat so held within this nation.'\n\n By the 9th section of the same act it was provided as follows:\n'Sec. 9. That any noncitizen, subject to a permit tax under the provisions of  1 of this act, and who shall refuse to pay his permit tax, after due notice for thirty days, shall be deemed an intruder by virtue of the intercourse law of the United States of America, and subject to removal; and such intruder shall be reported to the United States Indian agent (or inspector) to the Five Civilized Tribes, and shall forthwith be removed from the Chickasaw Nation, under the direction of the said United States Indian agent or inspector.'\n\n The agreement made by the commission to the Five Civilized Tribes with the commissions representing the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes of Indians on April 23, 1897, as amended by the Curtis act, was, in  29 of that act, ratified and confirmed, and made operative on December 1, 1898 [ 30 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 517].\n By that agreement certain modifications, not material to be stated, were made in the legislative authority and judicial jurisdiction of the tribal governments, and, so modified, the tribal governments were continued in force, and are to so continue until March 4, 1906. One of the clauses of the agreement reads as follows: \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 391]\n\u00a0\n 'It is further agreed that no act, ordinance, or resolution of the council of either the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribes, in any manner affecting the land of the tribe, or of the individuals, after allotment, or the moneys or other property of the tribe or citizens thereof (except appropriations for the regular and necessary expenses of the government of the respective tribes), or the rights of any persons to employ any kind of labor, or the rights of any persons who have taken or may take the oath of allegiance to the United States, shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States. When such acts, ordinances, or resolutions passed by the council of either of said tribes shall be approved by the governor thereof, then it shall be the duty of the national secretary of said tribe to forward them to the President of the United States, duly certified and sealed, who shall, within thirty days after their reception, approve or disapprove the same. Said acts, ordinances, or resolutions, when so approved, shall be published in at least two newspapers having a bona fide circulation in the tribe to be affected thereby, and when disapproved shall be returned to the tribe enacting the same.'\n On September 17, 1900, and September 21, 1901, the proper construction of the Curtis act was considered, at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, in opinions of Attorney General Griggs and Attorney General Knox, respectively. In the first of those opinions it was, in substance, held as follows:\n'Under the treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians no person not a citizen or member of a tribe, or belonging to the exempted classes, can be lawfully within the limits of the country occupied by these tribes without their permission; and they have the right to impose the terms upon which such permission will be granted.\n\n'The provisions of the act of June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. at. L. 495, chap. 517), for the organization of cities and towns in said Indian country, and the extinguishment of Indian title therein, have not yet been consummated, and it is still Indian country. This \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 392]\n\u00a0\n act does not deprive these Indians of the power to enact laws with regard to licenses or taxes, nor exempt purchasers of town or city lots from the operation of such legislation.\n\n'Purchasers of lots do so with notice of existing Indian treaties, and with full knowledge that they can only occupy them by permission from the Indians. Such lands are sold under the assumption that the purchasers will comply with the local laws.\n\n'Sections 2147 to 2150, inclusive, of the Revised Statutes, expressly confer the right to use the military forces of the United States in ejecting trespassers upon Indian lands, and the grant of this power carries with it the duty of its exercise.\n\n'It is the duty of the Department of the Interior to remove all classes forbidden by treaty or law, who are within the domain of the Five Civilized Tribes without Indian permission; to close all businesses which require permit or license, and are being conducted without the same; and to remove all cattle which are being pastured on said land without Indian permit or license.'\n\n And in the last-mentioned opinion it was, in substance, declared that, under  16 of the Curtis act, the Secretary of the Interior had authority to collect a tribal tax imposed by the laws of the Cherokee Nation of Indians upon the exportation of prairie hay from that nation, and that the tax was just as applicable to hay raised upon lands occupied by individual members of the nation, as their share of the public domain, pending allotments, as in any other case, and would be so even if the shipper was the absolute owner of the land on which the hay was raised.\n Since the rendition of these opinions of the legal advisers of the government, Congress has created an express exception in favor of owners of town lots, prohibiting their being proceeded against as intruders, but has not legislated against the enforcement of the legislation now under review, which was then operative. Thus, on May 27, 1902, in the Indian appropriation act (32 Stat. at L. 259, chap. 888), it was provided 'That it shall \n\n[194 U.S. 384, 393]\n\u00a0\n hereafter be unlawful to remove or deport any person from the Indian territory who is in lawful possession of any lots or parcels of land in any town or city in the Indian territory which has been designated as a townsite under existing laws and treaties, and no part of this appropriation shall be used for the deportation or removal of any such person from Indian territory.'\n Viewing the Curtis act in the light of the previous decisions of this court and the dealings between the Chickasaws and the United States, we are of opinion that one of the objects occasioning the adoption of that act by Congress, having in view the peace and welfare of the Chickasaws, was to permit the continued exercise, by the legislative body of the tribe, of such a power as is here complained of, subject to a veto power in the President over such legislation, as a preventive of arbitrary and injudicious action.\n The refusal to pay the permit tax in question caused the cattle and horses of the complainants to be wrongfully within the territory, and we cannot decline to recognize such fact because of the hardships which it is alleged must arise if the act and regulations are enforced. Being of opinion that the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior are valid, and that the act of the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation, approved by the governor on May 5, 1902, and sanctioned by the President of the United States on May 15, 1902, was not the exercise of arbitrary power, as claimed, and that neither the act nor the regulations in any respect violate the Constitution of the United States, it follows that the judgment below is correct, and it must, therefore, be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n An Act to Prescribe Privilege or Permit Taxes, and Defining the Manner of their Collection.\n Be it Enacted by the Legislature of the Chickasaw Nation:\n Sec. 1. That there shall be paid upon live stock owned or held by noncitizens within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation, an annual privilege or permit tax, as follows: On cattle, horses, and mules, 25 cents per head; and on sheep and goats, 5 cents per head: Provided, That there shall be exempted from the provisions of this act, when owned and used by the head of a family, two cows and calves, and one team, consisting of two horses or two mules, or one horse and one mule; and the provisions of this act shall also apply to all live stock introduced into the Chickasaw Nation since January 1, 1902, upon which the tribal taxes imposed by the laws of the Chickasaw Nation have not been paid, with like force and effect as if such cattle had been owned and held within the limits of Chickasaw Nation for one year prior to the passage and approval of this act.\n Sec. 2. That such privilege or permit taxes shall hereafter be payable to such person or persons, and collected under such rules and regulations, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.\n Sec. 3. That the expenses of collecting such privilege or permit taxes shall be deducted from the gross collections, and the balance paid quarterly into the treasury of the Chickasaw Nation.\n Sec. 4. That such privilege or permit taxes shall be due and payable annually, upon demand, and if such taxes are not paid when demanded, the live stock upon which such taxes are due shall be held to be in the Chickasaw Nation without its consent, and unlawfully upon the lands of the Chickasaws, and the presence of such live stock, and owners or holders thereof, within the limits of said nation, shall be deemed detrimental to the peace and welfare of the Chickasaw Indians.\n Sec. 5. That all acts or parts of acts in conflict herewith, be and the same are, hereby repealed; and this act shall take effect from and after its approval by the President of the United States.\n In pursuance of the above and foregoing, the following regulations are promulgated:\n Regulations Prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior Governing the Introduction or Holding of Live Stock in the Chickasaw Nation by Noncitizens.\n Sec. 1. Any person, other than a recognized citizen of the Choctaw or Chickasaw Nations, desiring to introduce or hold stock of any description within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation, Indian territory, shall first make application to the United States Indian inspector for the Indian territory, Muscogee, Indian territory, and shall pay to the United States Indian agent, Union agency, an annual tax of twenty-five (25) cents per head on all cattle, horses, and mules, and on all sheep and goats five (5) cents per \n head, provided that there shall be exempted from the provisions of these regulations, when owned and used by the head of a family, two cows and calves, and one team of horses, or two mules, or one horse and one mule.\n Sec. 2. Such tax shall be paid January 1st of each year, or prior to the time of the introduction of such stock, and accompanying such remittance there shall be furnished, under oath, a full description of such stock, including the number and brands, together with any other desired information.\n Sec. 3. Such taxes shall apply to all stock introduced within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation since January 1, 1902, upon which taxes have not already been paid to the Chickasaw Nation, and for which the owners or holders cannot produce receipts.\n Sec. 4. The tax prescribed shall be paid annually, in advance, whether such stock is held the entire succeeding twelve months or for a portion of such time.\n Sec. 5. When cattle are held by a citizen, and mortgaged to a noncitizen, not in good faith, but for the purpose of evading the payment of taxes, said cattle shall be considered as owned or held by such noncitizen, and subject to these regulations and taxes.\n Sec. 6. Parties who now hold stock within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation should remit the taxes prescribed promptly to the United States Indian agent at Muscogee, Indian territory, and such payments must be made within ten (10) days from the date of receiving notice of these regulations. If such taxes are not paid within this time remittances made thereafter will not be accepted; but such stock and any other stock found within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation after July 1, 1902, upon which taxes have not been paid, will be considered as being within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation unlawfully, and measures will be adopted looking to the removal by the United States Indian agent of such stock, together with the owners or holders thereof, without further notice.\n Sec. 7. Authorized agents of the Interior Department will make necessary investigations and reports, and see that proper remittances are forwarded, acting under the direction of the United States Indian inspector for Indian territory, but will not be authorized to receive or collect any taxes whatsoever, as all payments must be made direct to the United States Indian agent, who will furnish receipts for all payments made.\n Sec. 8. These regulations and taxes will apply to all stock as indicated, held within the limits of the Chickasaw Nation by other than recognized citizens of the Choctaw or Chickasaw Nations, whether held upon the public domain or upon lands leased from individual Indians.\n Thos. Ryan, Acting Secretary\n Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C. Approved June 3, 1902. \n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMUTUAL LIFE INS. CO. OF NEW YORK v. HILL(1904)\nNo. 166\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n On April 28, 1886, George D. Hill, at Seattle, Washington, signed a written application to the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York ( hereinafter called the insurance company) for a policy of $20,000. The application was forwarded to the home office. The insurance company accepted the application, executed a policy, and forwarded it to its local agent at Seattle, who there, on June 12, 1886, received the first premium and delivered the policy to Hill. The beneficiary named in the policy was Ellen K. Hill, the wife of the applicant. She died on February 14, 1887, leaving four children, the present defendants in error. A premium receipt for the second annual premium was, in 1887, forwarded to the local agent \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n at Seattle, presented by him to Hill, and not paid. No subsequent premiums were paid, and on December 4, 1890, Hill died.\n Thereafter this action was commenced in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Washington. The contention of the plaintiffs is that, although the annual premiums for 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890 had not been paid, the insurance company was nevertheless indebted to them for the full amount of the policy and interest, by reason of the fact that it had failed to give the notice of forfeiture prescribed by chapter 341, Laws 1876, as amended by chapter 321, Laws 1877, of the state of New York. The complaint set out a copy of the policy, alleged the payment of the first annual premium, the death of the insured, and the relationship of the plaintiffs to the beneficiary. The defendant relied upon the nonpayment of the premiums other than the first, and an abandonment of the contract. A demurrer to these defenses was sustained and a judgment entered for the plaintiffs, which was affirmed by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit. 49 L. R. A. 127, 38 C. C. A. 159, 97 Fed. 263. A writ of certiorari was issued by this court (\n178 U.S. 683\n, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1032), the judgment reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings. \n178 U.S. 347\n, 44 L. ed. 1097, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914. An amended answer and a replication were then filed by leave of the circuit court. A trial was had before the court and a jury, which resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs. This judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals. (55 C. C. A. 536, 118 Fed. 708) and the case was again brought here on certiorari. \n188 U.S. 742\n, 47 L. ed. 678, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856.\n Messrs. Julien T. Davies, Edward Lyman Short, John B. Allen, Frederic D. McKenney, and E. C. Hughes for petitioner.\n Messrs. Stanton Warburton, George Turner, Eben Smith, and Harold Preston for respondents.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n A preliminary matter is this: When the case was here before we held that, upon the record, there was disclosed an abandonment of the insurance contract by both the insured and the beneficiaries, and on that ground the judgment was reversed. It is now contended that 'the only question left open by the mandate of this court was a submission of this question;' that our decision was substantially an adjudication that the plaintiffs had a right to recover unless it was shown that there had been an abandonment of the insurance contract, and that upon this trial it was shown that there had been no such abandonment, the insured having always expressed a wish to continue the policy, the beneficiary named in the policy having died before the second premium became due, and her children, who became entitled thereafter as beneficiaries, being minors and in actual ignorance of its existence. That decision was based upon the averments of the pleadings, and these pleadings were amended after the judgment was reversed and the case returned to the trial court. Clearly, the contention of the plaintiffs is not sustainable. When a case is presented to an appellate court it is not obliged to consider and decide all the questions then suggested or which may be supposed likely to arise in the further progress of the litigation. If it finds that in one respect an error has been committed so substantial as to require a reversal of the judgment, it may order a reversal without entering into any inquiry or determination of other questions. While undoubtedly an affirmance of a judgment is to be considered an adjudication by the appellate court that none of the claims of error are well founded,-even though all are not specifically referred to in the opinion,-yet no such conclusion follows in case of a reversal. It is impossible to foretell what shape the second trial may take or what questions may then be presented. Hence the rule is that a judgment of reversal is not necessarily an adjudication by the appellate \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n court of any other than the questions in terms discussed and decided. An actual decision of any question settles the law in respect thereto for future action in the case. Here, after one judgment on the pleadings had been set aside, on amended pleadings a trial was had, quite a volume of testimony presented, and a second judgment entered. That judgment is now before us for review, and all questions which appear upon the record and have not already been decided are open for consideration.\n Previous decisions in kindred cases have established these propositions: First, the state of Washington, was the place of the contract. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Clements, \n140 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 35 S. L. ed. 497, 500, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822; Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Cohen, \n179 U.S. 262\n, 45 L. ed. 181, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106. Second, the statutory provision of the state of New York in reference to forfeitures has no extraterritorial effect, and does not of itself apply to contracts made by a New York company outside of that state. Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Cohen, \n179 U.S. 262\n, 45 L. ed. 181, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106. Third, parties contracting outside of the state of New York may, by agreement, incorporate into the contract the laws of that state and make its provisions controlling upon both parties, provided such provisions do not conflict, with the law or public policy of the state in which the contract is made. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Clements, \n140 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 35 S. L. ed. 497, 500, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822; Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Cohen, \n179 U.S. 262\n, 45 L. ed. 181, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106. If it were necessary, other cases from this and state courts might be cited in support of these propositions. Applying them, it follows that, as Washington was the place of the contract, the laws of that state control its terms and obligations, unless the parties thereto have stipulated for some other laws. Such a stipulation, it is insisted, is found in this contract. In determining the effect of such a stipulation it must be borne in mind that the applicability of other laws than those of the state of the place of contract is a matter of agreement, and that the agreement may select laws and also limit the extent of their applicability. The case is precisely like one in which \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n the parties, without mentioning laws or state, stipulate that the contract shall be determined in accordance with certain specified rules.\n This insurance policy contains these recitals:\n'In consideration of the application for this policy, which is hereby made a part of this contract, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York promises to pay at its home office in the city of New York, unto Ellen Kellogg Hill, wife of George Dana Hill, of Seattle, in the county of King, Washington territory, for her sole use, if living, in conformity with the statute, and if not living, to such of the children of their bodies as shall be living at the death of the said wife, or to their guardian for their use, $20,000; upon acceptance of satisfactory proofs at its said office, of the death of the said George Dana Hill during the continuance of this policy, upon the following condition; and subject to the provisions, requirements, and benefits stated on the back of this policy, which are hereby referred to and made part thereof:\n\n'The annual premium of $814 and-cents shall be paid in advance on the delivery of this policy, an thereafter to the company at its home office in the city of New York, on the 29th day of April in every year during the continuance of this contract.\n\n ... * *\n'Payment of premiums.-Each premium is due and payable at the home office of the company in the city of New York; but will be accepted elsewhere when duly made in exchange for the company's receipt, signed by the president or secretary. Notice that each and every such payment is due at the date named in the policy is given and accepted by the delivery and acceptance of this policy, and any further notice required by any statute is thereby expressly waived.\n\n ... * *\n'Paid-up policy.-After three full annual premiums have been paid upon this policy, the company will, upon the legal surrender thereof before default in payment of any premium, \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n or within six months thereafter, issue a paid-up policy, payable as herein provided for the amount required by the provisions of the act of May 21, 1879, chap. 347, Laws of the state of New York.'\n\n In the application are these provisions:\n'If said policy be issued, the declarations, agreements, and warranties herein contained shall be a part thereof; and the contract of insurance when made shall be held and construed at all times and places to have been made in the city of New York.\n\n ... * *\n'4th. Policyholders must not expect to be notified when their premiums will be due. It is a practice of the company to send these notices, as reminders when the address is known, but no responsibility is assumed on the part of the company in consequence of their nonreception.'\n\n The statute of New York, relied upon as controlling, forbids the forfeiture of any life insurance policy unless 'a written or printed notice stating the amount of such premium or interest due on such policy, the place where said premium or interest should be paid, and the person to whom the same is payable, shall be duly addressed and mailed to the person whose life is assured, or the assignee of the policy, if notice of the assignment has been given to the company, at his or her last known postoffice address, postage paid by the company, or by an agent of such company or person appointed by it to collect such premium. Such notice shall further state that unless the said premium or interest then due shall be paid to the company or to a duly appointed agent or other person authorized to collect such premium within thirty days after the mailing of such notice, the said policy and all payments thereon will become forfeited and void.'\n Now, to what extent were the statutes of New York made by these stipulations controlling? It is stated in the application that the contract of insurance is to 'be held and construed at all times and places to have been made in the city of New \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n York.' It might with some plausibility be contended that this general provision is limited to the matter which precedes it in the same sentence, to wit, the 'declarations, agreements, and warranties herein contained.' This contention is reinforced by the fact that elsewhere in the contract there is special mention of one statute of New York,-to wit, chap. 347, Laws 1879,-which is made controlling in reference to a single matter.\n But assuming that the general declaration that the contract is to be held and construed to have been made in the city of New York would, if there was nothing else, make controlling all the applicable statutes of that state, it is limited by other express agreements of the policy. Among these are that 'notice that each and every such payment is due at the date named in the policy is given and accepted by the delivery and acceptance of this policy, and any further notice required by any statute is thereby expressly waived,' and also that 'policyholdcrs must not expect to be notified when their premiums will be due. It is a practice of the company to send these notices, as reminders when the address is known, but no responsibility is assumed on the part of the company in consequence of their nonreception.' Language could not be clearer to the effect that the party accepting the policy admits thereby the receipt of every notice in respect to the payment of premium which can be implied from any other part of the policy or required by any statute. The contention is that this express stipulation in reference to notice is nullified by the general provision that the contract is to be construed to have been made in the city of New York. It is urged that the laws of New York control in the construction of any contract made in that state, that they require notice as a condition of forfeiture, and forbid a waiver of such notice, and therefore that the agreement in the policy in respect to notice is overthrown by the law of the state. But that assumes that the contract was made in New York, whereas it was in fact made in Washington, and the laws of New York are controlling in any re- \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n spect only because the parties have so stipulated, and, as we have indicated, the stipulation in respect thereto is to be harmonized with the other stipulations in the contract. The ordinary rule in respect to the construction of contracts is this: that where there are two clauses in any respect conflicting, that which is specially directed to a particular matter controls in respect thereto over one which is general in its terms, although within its general terms the particular may be included. Because, when the parties express themselves in reference to a particular matter, the attention is directed to that, and it must be assumed that it expresses their intent; whereas a reference to some general matter, within which the particular may be included, does not necessarily indicate that the parties had the particular matter in thought. Here, when the parties stipulate that no other notice shall be required, attention is directed to the particular matter of notice. When the stipulation is that the contract shall be construed to have been made in New York, no particular statute is referred to, and the attention may not be directed to the matter of notice or any other special feature of New York law. The special controlled the general; that which must have been in the minds of the contracting parties controls that which may not have been, although included within the language of the latter stipulation. This is the general rule in the construction of all documents,-contracts as well as statutes. Bock v. Perkins, \n139 U.S. 628\n, 35 L. ed. 314, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 677, and cases cited; Rodgers v. United States, \n185 U.S. 83\n, 46 L. ed. 816, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582, and cases cited; Winebrenner v. Forney, \n189 U.S. 148\n, 47 L. ed. 754, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590; Sedgw. Stat. & Const. Law, 2d ed. p. 360 and note; 2 Parsons, Contr. 6th ed. p. 501 and note.\n Obviously, the express stipulation in the policy as to the matter of notice must be held paramount, and to that extent limiting the provision of the New York law in reference to notice which was not specially referred to in the contract, and can be invoked only because it is one of the various statutes of New York applicable to insurance policies.\n Beyond the proposition that, by the terms of the policy, the \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n insured was bound to take notice of the time when the payment of the second premium was due, it was also shown by the testimony that the renewal receipt was forwarded to the local agent at Seattle and by him presented to the insured, so that there was notice in fact as well as notice implied from a receipt of the policy. Under those circumstances the insured failed to pay, and continued such failure for four years prior to his death. Yet, notwithstanding his failure to perform his part of the contract,-and performance by the insured underlies the obligation of the insurance company to peform on its part,-this company to perform on its part,-this by the company that would have been due if he had performed. It is simple justice between two parties to a contract containing depending stipulations that neither should be permitted to exact performance by the other without having himself first performed. It is true cases arise in which one party is enabled to take advantage of some statutory provision and exact compliance from the other without having himself first complied, and courts may not ignore the scope and efficacy of such statutory provisions; but, nevertheless, a judgment for failure to perform against one party in favor of the other, when the latter was the first delinquent, is offensive to the sense of righteousness and fair dealing. We have had before us a series of cases coming from the same jurisdiction in which, when the insured had, for a series of years, neglected to pay their insurance premiums or perform their parts of the insurance contract, their heirs or beneficiaries have, on their deaths, sought to obtain judgments against the insurance company for the amounts which would have been due on the policies if the insured had performed their stipulations in respect to the payment of premiums. Courts have always set their faces against an insurance company which, having received its premiums, has sought by technical defenses to avoid payment, and in like manner should they set their faces against an effort to exact payment from an insurance company when the premiums have deliberately been left unpaid. We cite with ap- \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n proval the decision of the supreme court of Washington in a recent case ( Lone v. Mutual L. Ins. Co.) decided December 21, 1903, and reported in 74 Pac. 689, in which, as in this case, the insured made payment of one premium and then lived years without making further payment, and in which the court said, in reference to the New York statute here relied upon, and the conduct of the insured:\n'The statute, it is true, provides that no life insurance company shall have power to declare forfeited or lapsed any policy by reason of the nonpayment of any annual premium, unless notice be given in a specified manner; but a statute must be construed, and its provisions enforced, with reference to its objects; and the legislature, taking into consideration the infirmities of memory, enacted this statute for the purpose of preventing insurance companies from taking what, in homely phrase, is termed 'snap judgment' on its patrons, thereby depriving them of the benefit of contracts by reason of slight negligence on their part, and when there was no real intention to rescind,-a beneficent and just law if enforced in the spirit of its enactment, but oppressive and unjust if construed with narrow and literal exactness.\n\n ... * *\n'We are satisfied that the thought never occurred to Rex during his lifetime that he had a claim against this company on the policy which had been issued so many years before, or, if he did, after the lapse of any appreciable time, it was a dishonest thought, for he knew that he had not performed the duties which devolved upon him under the contract, and that he had no rights thereunder; and there seems to be no just reason why his administrator should demand rights which he had virtually waived. In Shutte v. Thompson, 15 Wall. 151, 21 L. ed. 123, where a party was standing upon his statutory right in relation to the notice concerning the depositions, the court said that it was not doubted that all the provisions of the statute respecting notice to the adverse party could be waived by him; that a \n\n[193 U.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n party could waive any provision, either of a contract or of a statute, intended for his benefit; and that, if a course of action on his part had misled the other party, he ought not to be allowed to avail himself of his original rights, because, under such circumstances, he would be availing himself of what was substantially a fraud, and that he should not be allowed to reap any advantage from his own fraud.\n\n ... * *\n'From every consideration of justice and fair dealing, we think the respondent should not be allowed to recover in this case.'\n\n The judgments of the Circuit Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial and to proceed further in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Peckham took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK v. WILEY(1904)\nNo. 53\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. J. Boucher, Constantine J. Smyth, and Thomas D. Crane for plaintiff in error. \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James H. McIntosh for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action upon a judgment rendered in one of the courts of Ohio, and the question to be considered is whether the final judgment under review gave to the proceedings in the Ohio court such faith and credit as are required by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n The Constitution, art. 4,  1, provides that 'full faith \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.' The statute enacted in execution of that power (Rev. Stat.  905, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677), provides for the authentication of the records and judicial proceedings of the several states and territories and any country subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and declares that 'the said records and judicial proceedings, so authenticated, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from which they are taken.'\n The Wiley Construction Company, a Massachusetts corporation, and Wiley, the defendant in error, executed and delivered to the National Exchange Bank, the plaintiff in error, a written instrument,-being a note with warrant of attorney annexed,-dated Tiffin, Ohio, April 26th, 1884, in which, for value received, they jointly and severally promised to pay to that bank, or order, on the 1st day of October, 1884, at its office in that city, $10,000, with 8 per cent interest after maturity. The instrument authorized N. L. Brewer, or any attorney at law in the United States, or elsewhere, to appear before any court of record, after such obligation became due, waive the issuing and service of process, and confess judgment against the obligors or either of them 'in favor of the holder' for the amount then appearing to be due, together with the cost of suit; and thereupon to release all errors and writs of error, and, in behalf of the obligors or either of them, waive all right to appeal and stay of execution.\n On the 31st day of July, 1899, nearly fifteen years after the maturity of the note, the National Exchange Bank instituted suit against both obligors in the court of common pleas of Seneca county, Ohio,-a court of general jurisdiction in that state,-to recover the balance due on that obligation, which was alleged to be $5,772.70, with interest from May 9th, \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n 1887, at 8 per cent. Upon it was credited a payment of $6,311.75, as of May 9th, 1887\n\n\n It may be here stated that there was no indorsement on the note showing that it had ever been assigned or transferred by the original payee.\n With the petition in that suit were filed copies of the paper constituting the note and warrant of attorney. With it was also filed an answer, in which an attorney, assuming, by virtue of the above warrant, and not otherwise, to be the attorney of the construction company and of Wiley, confessed judgment against them for the full amount claimed by the bank.\n On the very day of the bringing of that suit judgment was entered against the defendants therein for $11,419.68, being the amount of the obligation with interest as 8 per cent from May 9th, 1887; the judgment reciting that the attorney who acted under the warrant of attorney, naming him in person, by virtue of that warrant, entered the appearance of the defendants, waived the issuing and service of process, confessed judgment, and released and waived all exceptions, errors, and right of appeal.\n The present action was by the National Exchange Bank against Wiley on the judgment rendered in the Ohio suit. The defendant disputed the plaintiff's right to recover upon several grounds, one of which was that, prior to the institution of the Ohio suit, and more than twelve years before the commencement of the present action, the note had been fully discharged, so far as he was concerned, pursuant to an agreement between him and the holder. But on this writ of error we are concerned only with the part of the defense which distinctly raises a Federal question.\n The defendant alleged that the warrant of attorney annexed to the note of April 26th, 1884, did not authorize a confession of judgment against the obligors except in favor of the 'holder;' that so far from the National Exchange Bank being such holder when it brought the Ohio suit, the Tiffin National Bank, as early as March 2, 1885, purchased, received, and \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n became the holder of the obligation, and thereafter remained and still was the holder; that, therefore, the attorney professing to act in behalf of the defendants in the Ohio suit had no authority, in virtue of such warrant of attorney, to represent them in that suit, or to confess judgment in favor of the National Exchange Bank; that the defendant was neither served with process in the Ohio suit nor had any notice thereof; that the Ohio court was entirely without authority or jurisdiction to render judgment against him in favor of the plaintiff bank; and that its authority or jurisdiction could not be upheld consistently with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The plaintiff insisted that it was the holder of the note when put in suit; further, that the court in Ohio had full power and jurisdiction to render the judgment in question, and that neither personal service of process, on nor notice to the obligors was necessary in order to give that court jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter.\n Both at the trial and in the supreme court of Nebraska the bank contended that full faith and credit, as required by the Constitution and laws of the United States, would not be given to the proceedings in the Ohio suit if the judgment in its favor was held not to be conclusive in respect of the authority of the Ohio court to render such judgment.\n It is unnecessary to set out all the instructions. It is sufficient to say that the jury were, in substance, instructed that the warrant of attorney authorized a confession of judgment in favor of the holder of the note; that it was to be presumed upon the showing made by the record of the Ohio court that it had jurisdiction to render the judgment sued on; and that such presumption continued throughout this case unless the defendant, by a preponderance of evidence, proved that the plaintiff bank was not, in fact, the holder of the note when put in suit in Ohio. The jury were also instructed that if the plaintiff was found not to be such holder, the verdict should be for the defendant. \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n The jury's verdict was for the defendant, and the judgment thereon was affirmed. Upon the issue as to the ownership of the note at the time it was sued on in Ohio there was, as the supreme court of Nebraska held, proof both ways.\n Did the Ohio court have jurisdiction to render the judgment in question? It is a settled doctrine, Chief Justice Marshall said, in Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 269, 2 L. ed. 617, that the effect of every judgment must depend upon the power of the court to render that judgment. In determining whether the Ohio court had authority to render the judgment against the obligors in the note, we must look first into the decisions of the highest court of that state.\n In Osborn v. Hawley (1850) 19 Ohio, 130, the plaintiff declared as indorsee of a promissory note, to which was attached a power of attorney to confess judgment. The report of that case is very meager, but in the course of the opinion the court said: 'The power of attorney is not negotiable, and when the legal title to the note is transferred the power of attorney becomes invalid, and no power whatever can be exercised under it, for the benefit of the indorsee; and he holds the note as if no such power had ever been attached to it.'\n In Marsden v. Soper (1860) 11 Ohio St. 503, the plaintiff declared on a note to which was attached a warrant of attorney authorizing a confession of judgment 'in favor of any holder.' A suit was brought on the note in one of the courts of Ohio by the indorsee thereof, and judgment was confessed under a warrant of attorney annexed to the note. The question was whether the court had jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants so as to authorize a judgment affecting their rights. The supreme court of Ohio said: 'It will be noticed that the plaintiff in this judgment is not the payee of the note on which judgment is taken, but an indorsee; and that the warrant of attorney under which judgment was confessed purports to authorize such confession 'in favor of any holder of this obligation,' after the same becomes due. But, it was held, in broad and general terms, in the case of Ocborn v. Hawley, 19 Ohio, \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n 130, that a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, attached to a note, and forming a part of the same instrument, is not negotiable, and when the note is transferred becomes invalid and inoperative. It is true, the report of that case does not inform us whether the warrant of attorney in that case purported to authorize the confession of a judgment in favor of the payee of the note alone, or whether its terms extended, as in this case, to any holder of the note after due. But, however this may have been in that case, we suppose that, if this judgment rested upon the confession under the warrant of attorney alone, it would be very questionable whether the court of common pleas had any rightful jurisdiction of the defendants in the judgment.'\n In Cushman v. Welsh, 19 Ohio St. 536, 539, the warrant of attorney authorized a confession of judgment 'in favor of the legal holder.' The note there in question was payable to order, and had not been regularly indorsed to the party who in fact purchased and owned it, and in whose name suit was brought. The question in the case was whether the confession under the warrant of attorney authorized judgment in favor of the purchaser. The court said: 'Though he might, as the owner of the note in equity, have brought an action thereon, under the provisions of the Code, in his own name, against the makers of the note, it does not follow that he could obtain judgment by confession of their warrant of attorney attached to the note. That depends on the extent of the power conferred by the warrant. The attorney can do nothing more than execute the power conferred by his warrant; moreover, 'all authorities of this sort must be strictly pursued.' Cowie v. Allaway, 8 T. R. 257. 'Indeed, formal instruments of this sort are ordinarily subjected to a strict interpretation, and the authority is never extended beyond that which is given in terms, or which is necessary and proper for carrying the authority so given into full effect.' Story, Agency,  68. Now, the power conferred by the terms of the instrument in this case was, to confess judgment \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n only 'in favor of the legal holder' of the note. The plaintiff below was not the 'legal' holder of the note, for the note had not been indorsed to him. He could become the 'legal holder' of the note only 'by indorsement thereon,' as authorized by the statute. Swan & C. Stat. 862; Avery v. Latimer, 14 Ohio, 542. The waiving of process, and confession of judgment in favor of the plaintiff below, was not, then, within the authority conferred by the power of attorney. Under the rule of interpretation applicable to such instruments, we must conclude that the jurisdiction of the defendants below, obtained through the warrant of attorney only, and the confession of judgment by means thereof, exceeded the authority conferred by the defendants in their power of attorney, and that the court, therefore, erred in overruling their motion to set aside the judgment, irregularly obtained against them.'\n In Watson v. Paine, 25 Ohio St. 340, which was an action upon a judgment based on a warrant of attorney attached to a promissory note, and which authorized any attorney at law to confess judgment in favor of the holder of the note, the point was made that the warrant of attorney did not authorize the waiving of process or an appearance for the defendants in an action brought by an indorsee. The members of the supreme court of Ohio were divided in opinion on that point, and it was left undecided. The case went off upon another ground, but McIlvaine, J., delivering the judgment of the court, expressed his individual opinion that a power to confess judgment in favor of any holder of the note may be exerted as well in favor of an indorsee as of the payee.\n But in Clements v. Hull, 35 Ohio St. 141-143, it was held that, under the Code of Civil Procedure, a warrant of attorney authorizing judgment to be confessed in favor of the holder of a note could be executed in favor of the equitable owner and holder, being the real party in interest. The court said: 'The scope of the power is not limited in this case as it was in the case Cushman v. Welsh, 19 Ohio St. 536, in favor of the legal holder only. The authority here given is 'to confess \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 266]\n\u00a0\n judgment in favor of the holder of said note,' and we think these words were intended, and should be construed, to embrace any holder who might lawfully prosecute an action on said note, in his own name and for his own use.'\n The latest case in the supreme court of Ohio is Spence v. Emerine, 46 Ohio St. 433, 440, 441, 15 Am. St. Rep. 634, 21 N. E. 866. There the note was payable to a named person or bearer, and the warrant of attorney authorized any attorney to appear for the obligor in any court of record in Ohio, and confess judgment for the amount then due, and to release all errors and the right of appeal. The confession was in favor of one to whom the note had been transferred by delivery merely. The question was as to the power of the court to render the judgment. The supreme court of Ohio, after referring to its prior adjudications, said: 'Whether the warrant of attorney can be executed for the benefit of a holder of the note other than the payee must depend upon the language of the warrant itself. But it is an established principle that an authority given by warrant of attorney to confess a judgment against the maker of the note must be clear and explicit and strictly pursued, and we cannot supply any supposed omissions of the parties. Cushman v. Welsh, 19 Ohio St. 536; Cowie v. Allaway, 8 T. R. 257; Henshall v. Matthew, 1 Dowl. P. C. 217; Foster v. Claggett, 6 Dowl. P. C. 524; Manufacturers' & M. Bank v. St. John, 5 Hill, 497. The power of attorney attached to the note in controversy does not, in express language, authorize a confession of judgment in favor of anyone, not even of the payee; but if such authority might be implied as to the payee, we cannot, under the rule of a strict interpretation, extend that implication in favor of the defendant in error, to whom the note was transferred by delivery. . . . It will thus be seen that where it has been adjudged by the court that a power of attorney to confess a judgment may be executed in favor of a party other than the payee, it has been in cases where authority was expressly conferred to confess a judgment in favor of a legal \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 267]\n\u00a0\n holder or holder of the note. The decisions have all been based upon a strict interpretation of the power granted, without aiding any omission or defect in its terms by liberal intendment or construction. In accordance with the views which we have expressed, our conclusion is, that the warrant of attorney attached to the note sued on did not authorize a confession of judgment in favor of defendant in error, and, there having been no summons or other notice to the plaintiff in error of the bringing of the original action, the court of common pleas acquired no jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff in error, and erred in rendering a judgment against him.'\n Looking at the face of the note, the National Exchange Bank insists that, being payee, it was also the holder within the meaning of the warrant of attorney, however strictly construed; that nothing else appearing than the note and warrant, a confession of judgment in its favor was in conformity with law and usage in Ohio, as declared by the highest court of that state. We incline to think that that position is justified by the above cases, when carefully considered; and assuming such to be the law as administered in Ohio,-which is the view most favorable to the plaintiff in error,-the question still remains whether the judgment, when sued on in another state, may be collaterally attacked upon the ground that the party in whose behalf it was rendered was not in fact the holder, because not the real owner of the note? This question must, we think, be answered in the affirmative. It can be so answered without doing violence to the Constitution or the laws of the United States. While the words of the warrant of attorney might be held to embrace any holder, even the equitable owner, who might rightfully prosecute an action on the note in his own name and for his own use (Clements v. Hull, 35 Ohio St. 141), yet if it was true, as alleged, that in 1885 the Tiffin National Bank purchased, received, and became the owner of the note, then the National Exchange Bank could not thereafter rightfully sue on it in \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 268]\n\u00a0\n its name and for its own use. Here, the confession of judgment was in behalf of the payee bank, which was not entitled to sue for its own use or to receive the proceeds if it sold the note in 1885, and never afterwards became the owner. The words, in the warrant of attorney, 'in favor of the holder of this instrument,' ought not, as between the National Exchange Bank and the obligors, to be construed as embracing the former after it ceased to be the owner of the note, but, at most, as only authorizing a confession of judgment in favor of the party who had become its real owner. It should not be supposed that the obligors intended, or that the payee bank ever understood them as intending, to authorize a confession of judgment in favor of one who was not entitled, or right, to demand payment from the obligors. That view accords with justice, and, not being inconsistent with the words in the warrant of attorney, it should be adopted.\n Byles on Bills says that 'holder is a general word, applied to anyone in actual or constructive possession of the bill, and entitled at law to recover or receive its contents from the parties to it.' Sharswood's ed. 66. So in 1 Persons on Bills & Notes it is said that 'by the holder of negotiable paper is meant, in law, the owner of it; for if it be in his possession without title or interest he is, in general, considered only as the agent of the owner.' p. 253. So that proof that the payee bank was not the owner of the note when it brought suit in Ohio tended to show that it was not in law the 'holder' of the instrument within what must be regarded as the true meaning of the warrant of attorney, and, therefore, that the court was without authority to enter judgment by confession in its favor against the obligor. In other words, the defendant Wiley could show collaterally that he was not legally before the court-as he was not, in any just sense-if his appearance was entered and judgment confessed by one who had, in fact, at the time, no authority to do either; and, consequently, that the court was without jurisdiction to proceed except on legal notice to him, or without his appearance in \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 269]\n\u00a0\n person or by an attorney authorized to represent him. If law and usage in Ohio were to the contrary, then such law and usage would be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States; for it is thoroughly settled that a personal judgment against one not before the court by actual service of process, or who did not appear in person or by an authorized attorney, would be invalid as not being in conformity with due process of law.\n This whole subject was carefully considered in Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 463, 469, 21 L. ed. 897, 899, 901. That was an action of trespass, brought in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York for taking and carrying away a certain sloop. The defendant, a New Jersey sheriff, had seized the vessel, pursuant, as he claimed, to a statute of New Jersey relating to the raking of clams, and proceeded against it before two justices of Monmouth county, New Jersey, by whom it was condemned and ordered to be sold. Those justices had no jurisdiction, under the statute, to act in the premises, unless the seizure and the offense both occurred in that county. The record of the case recited that the offense was committed and the seizure made in Monmouth county, and the contention was that the record was conclusive, both as to the jurisdiction of the court and the merits of the case. In that case it was held to be competent for the complaining party to prove collaterally that the vessel was not seized in Monmouth county, and therefore that the facts necessary to the exercise of jurisdiction by the New Jersey justices did not exist, although their existence was recited or affirmed in the official record made by them. Speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, this court adjudged, in the language ofStory, that the Constitution 'did not make the judgments of other states domestic judgments to all intents and purposes, but only gave a general validity, faith, and credit to them, as evidence;' and, upon an elaborate review of previous cases, that 'the jurisdiction of the court by which a judgment is rendered in any state may be questioned in a collateral \n\n[195 U.S. 257, 270]\n\u00a0\n proceeding in another state, notwithstanding the provision of the 4th article of the Constitution and law of 1790 [Rev. Stat.  905, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 677 et seq.], and notwithstanding the averments contained in the record of the judgment itself.' There has been no departure in the decisions of this court from the doctrines announced in Thompson v. Whitman, whether the question related to courts of general or to courts of limited or special jurisdiction. It has been repeatedly affirmed. Knowles v. Logansport Gaslight & Coke Co. 19 Wall. 58, 61, 22 L. ed. 70, 72; Hall v. Lanning, \n91 \nU.S. 160, 165\n, 23 S. L. ed. 271, 273; Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 732\n, 24 S.

Andrews, \n188 \nU.S. 14, 34\n, 47 S. L. ed. 366, 370, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237. The general jurisdiction of the Ohio court undoubtedly embraced such a cause of action as was set forth in the suit on the note. But we are of opinion that that court had not authority or jurisdiction to render judgment against the obligors if the National Exchange Bank had in fact sold the note, and ceased, before the commencement of that suit, to own it or to be entitled to receive the proceeds to its own use. It was, in such case, in legal effect, a personal judgment without service of process upon the defendants, and without their appearance in person or by an authorized attorney. The proceedings were wanting in due process of law. The obligors never consented to judgment by confession in favor of one who was not the owner of the note or entitled to receive its proceeds, and the warrant of attorney cannot be held to have authorized such a confession.\n Perceiving no error of law in the record the judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL MUT.

The action was brought under  2348 of the Code of the state of 1892, which provides as follows:\n'The legal rate of interest on all notes, accounts, and contracts shall be 6 per centum per annum; but contracts may be made, in writing, for the payment of a rate of interest as great as 10 per centum per annum. And if a greater rate of interest than 10 per centum shall be stipulated for, or received in any case, all interest shall be forfeited, and may be recovered back, whether the contract be executed or executory; but this section shall not apply to a building and loan association domiciled in this state, dealing only with its members.' \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 636]\n\u00a0\n The case was tried to a jury, which, under the instructions of the court, returned a verdict for the defendant in error, upon which judgment was duly entered. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 80 Miss, 407, 57 L. R. A. 793, 31 So. 840. This writ of error was then sued out.\n\n The plaintiff in error is a building and loan association, incorporated under chapter 123 of the Laws of the state of New York, passed April 10, 1815, entitled 'An Act for the Incorporation of Building, Mutual Loan and Accumulating Fund Associations,' and the acts amendatory thereof, to wit,-chap. 564, passed June 9, 1875; chap. 96, passed April 1, 1878\n\n\n The purpose of the association is to make loans only to its members, and for the further purpose of accumulating a fund to be returned to its members who do not receive advances on their shares.\n The management of the association is vested in a board of directors, who have power to make by-laws. There is a president and other officers and a standing committee. The latter passes on all applications for loans. Membership is obtained by holding five or more shares of the associations and subscribing for membership. Shares are divided into three classes,- instalment shares, paid-up shares, and interest-bearing paid-up shares. We are only directly concerned with the first class. They are described in the articles of the association as follows:\n'Sec. 2. Instalment shares.-Instalment shares shall be issued in monthly series, and shall be dated the first business day of the month, and shall be due and become payable whenever the amount in the loan fund to the credit of such shares, consisting of monthly dues and profits apportioned to such shares, shall equal the face value of the shares.'\n\n It is provided, article 10, that dues on cach instalment share shall be 60 cents per month until the maturity of the shares. There is also a provision for fines and for The loan fund and loans are provided for as follows:\n'Sec. 1. The loan fund of the association shall consist of \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 637]\n\u00a0\n 50 cents of the monthly dues paid in on each share, interest, premiums, fines, and forfeitures, and the profits derived therefrom, and shall be loaned to members of the association by the board of directors upon approved applications for loans in the order in which they have been filed.\n\n'Sec. 2. Interest at the rate of not more than 6 per cent per annum will be charged upon all loans, which interest must be paid monthly, with the monthly dues, on or before the last business day of each month, until the maturity of the pledged shares, and a premium of not more than 50 cents per month will be charged on each $100 borrowed, which premium must be paid on or before the last business day of the month, for a period of eight years, or until the maturity of the pledged shares, should they mature before the expiration of the eight years. The premium for the first six months to be paid in advance.\n\n'Sec. 3. A member may pay such loan at any time after one year, on giving thirty days' notice in writing to the secretary, upon the payment of the amount borrowed, with interest and premium thereon, and a redemption fee of 50 cents per share. No redemption fee shall be charged on matured shares.'\n\n It is also provided that loans on real estate shall be secured by a first mortgage on the property offered for security, by promissory notes, bonds, mortgages, and deeds of trust of the applicant, or such other instruments as may be required, 'and for every loan of $100 he shall, in addition thereto, transfer to the association at least one share thereof as collateral security.'\n In 1892 the plaintiff in error had an agent in the city of Meridian, Miss., who was authorized to receive applications for stock and loans, and to receive payment of dues, interest, and premiums, and to transmit the applications and payments to plaintiff in error at its office in New York. The domicil of the plaintiff in error was and is New York. The defendant in error in 1892 was a citizen of the city of Meridian, and made application, through the agent of plaintiff in error \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 638]\n\u00a0\n at Meridian, for a loan of $2,500, and to subscribe for twenty-five shares of stock, as required by articles of plaintiff in error. The loan was granted by the executive committee, under the terms and according to the conditions of the articles of association. Defendant in error made the following payments 'as dues, interest, premium, and fines on said stock and loan, to wit: Advance premium sent the association at New York, $66.25; paid defendant's agent at Meridian, as shown by the receipt book hereto attached, $668.75, and $2,500 paid the association in New York by draft sent them on November 7, 1893, in full payment of said loan of May 21, 1892.'\n Defendant in error repaid this loan, but retained his twenty-five shares of stock, and paid his dues thereon for the months of December, 1893, to August, 1894, exclusive, amounting to the sum of $135.\n In October, 1894, he withdrew five shares and received from plaintiff in error $73.90, the withdrawal value thereof.\n In June, 1894, he withdrew five shares for another loan on his twenty shares, whcih was forwarded to plaintiff in error in New York by C. F. Woods It  agent. The loan was granted by the executive committee, and in consideration of the loan he executed to plaintiff in error a bond, assignment of shares, and mortgage of real estate.\n The loan was repaid by crediting thereon the sum of $649.70, the withdrawal value of his shares, payment by draft on New York of the sum of $ 1,473.96; interest, dues, fines, and premiums, $868. Part of the latter was paid through the agent and part was sent directly to plaintiff in error.\n The bond and mortgage given by defendant in error to secure the loan recited that they were given in consideration of such loan, and expressed, as one of their conditions, that defendant in error would repay the sum loaned to plaintiff in error 'at its office in New York city, with interest for the same at the rate of 6 per cent per annum until paid, together with a monthly premium of ten dollars and no cents for eight years, or until the earlier maturity of said shares, should they mature \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 639]\n\u00a0\n before the expiration of the eight years, and in addition thereto the sum of twelve dollars and no cents for the monthly dues on the said twenty shares, which interest, premium, and dues are payable monthly on or before the last business day of every month, at the office of the association in New York city, until the maturity of the said shares, except the said monthly premium, which is to be paid for eight years only, and also all fines which may be imposed by the said association for default in payment of said interest, premium, or dues.'\n To the declaration of defendant in error, plaintiff in error filed the general issue, with notice thereunder that plaintiff in error would give in evidence and prove the facts substantially as above stated. Subsequently, April, 1901, and August, 1901, plaintiff in error made motions for leave to amend its notice under the general issue. The amendments claimed rights under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, also under  10 of article 1 of that instrument, and under  1, article 4.\n Defendant in error moved to strike out the amendments on the ground that they were filed without leave of the court. The motion was granted.\n Testimony was introduced and at its conclusion defendant in error asked the court to direct the jury to find for him the excess paid over 6 per cent on both loans. The instruction was refused. The court, on the contrary, instructed the jury, at the request of plaintiff in error, that the first loan was not usurious. But the court charged the jury that the second loan was usurious, and directed them to find for defendant in error the sum paid by him in excess of 6 per cent on the loan ($2,000), with interest at 6 per cent per annum from July 1899, to date of trial.\n Plaintiff in error asked the court to instruct the jury sustantially as follows:\n\n 1. \nDefendant in error, as a borrowing shareholder, was entitled to and did share in the profits of the association, and the contract was, therefore, valid, and not usurious. \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 640]\n\u00a0\n 2. The contracts were made and consummated in new York, and performable there, and are to be construed by the laws of New York, and under those laws the contract is valid, and not usurious.\n\n 3. \nUnder the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, defendant in error had a right to become a member and shareholder of the association, to be a borrower from it upon the terms and conditions of its articles, and made contracts with it performable in the state of New York, and reciprocally, plaintiff in error had the right to make the loan, and entitled under said amendments to have the 'contracts considered and their validity determined by the laws of the state of New York,' where they were performable; and under  1, article 4, of the Constitution of the United States, was entitled to have the court give full faith and credit in determining the validity of the contracts with defendant in error, to the public records and judicial proceedings of the state of New York, especially the laws under which the plaintiff in error was incorporated, and the acts amending the same, and the decision in the case of Concordia Sav. & Aid Asso. v. Read, 93 N. Y. 474, and other decisions, which hold that the contracts are valid, and not usurious, under the laws of New York.\n\n 4. \nThe contract is not usurious under the laws of Mississippi.\n\n 5. \nSection 2348 of the Annotated Code of Mississippi, as sought to be applied, impairs the obligation of the said contracts, in violation of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n 6. \nThe decision of the supreme court of Mississippi in Sokoloski v. New South Bldg. & L. Asso. 77 Miss. 155, 26 So. 361, and the decisions following it having been rendered long after the making of said contracts, in so far as they define the public policy of Mississippi in regard to foreign building and loan associations are tantamount to judicial legislation, and in violation of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 641]\n\u00a0\n 7. The evidence shows that both loans have been voluntarily paid and settled by defendant in error with full knowledge of all the facts.\n\n 8. \nAs to the loan of 1894, the evidence shows that defendant in error, being a shareholder in the association, had a right to demand and receive advances or loans upon his shares upon the terms and conditions set out in the articles of the association, and the association was obliged to grant the same, and the said contract was made in pursuance of said right and application, and that the Code of Mississippi does not govern said contract, and is, as to said contract, 'both ex post facto, and impairing the obligation of said contract, and in violation of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States; and under  1, article 4, of said Constitution and the laws of New York and the 14th Amendment to said Constitution the said contract of August 30, 1894, is valid and enforceable, and not usurious.'\n The instruction was refused, and plaintiff in error excepted. The jury found for defendant in error for the sum of $677.96, being amount paid in excess of the loan, and for the sum of $93.79 interest. Judgment was entered upon the verdict. It was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, as we have said.\n Messrs. Albert S. Bozeman, J. S. Sexton, M. Green, and G. M. Thompson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 635, 643]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward Mayes and R. C. Beckctt for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 635, 646]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n It is objected that the Federal questions presented cannot be considered 'because they were not raised in time and the proper way,' and that the supreme court did nothing more than decline to pass on the questions because they had not been raised in the trial court, as required by the state practice.\n The supreme court considered that plaintiff in error, by the motions to amend the notice, attempted to 'inject' a Federal question into the record, and that the instruction asked by the plaintiff in error had the same purpose. The court said: 'It was another ingenious but unsuccessful effort to inject the Federal question into the record. If the court had allowed the amended notice and pleas to be filed, which presented nothing on the merits, but simply the alleged Federal question, then there would have been an issue involving the Federal question, to which an instruction would have been appropriate.'\n Upon the ruling of the court upon the amendments to the notice we are not called upon to express an opinion; but, we think, it is very clear that plaintiff in error was entitled to claim rights under the Constitution of the United States, based upon the case as presented. And if the rights asserted actually existed, plaintiff in error was entitled to an instruction directing a verdict in its favor. The claim was, therefore, made in time. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. v. Patten Paper Co. \n172 U.S. 58\n, 43 L. ed. 364, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 97; Rothschild v. Knight, \n184 U.S. 334\n, 46 L. ed. 573, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Meyer v.

Des Moines, \n173 U.S. 193\n, 43 L. ed. 665, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 379. It was also sufficient in form. \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 647]\n\u00a0\n The Federal questions presented by the record are reducible to two,- to wit: (1) That the decision of the supreme court of Mississippi was in effect an impairment of the contract between plaintiff in error and defendant in error. (2) That full faith and credit were not given to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of the state of New York.\n\n 1. \nThis contention is untenable. We said in Bacon v. Texas, \n163 U.S. 207\n, 41 L. ed. 132, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1023:\n'Where the Federal question upon which the jurisdiction of this court is based grows out of an alleged impairment of the obligation of a contract, it is now definitely settled that the contract can only be impaired within the meaning of this clause in the Constitution, so as to give this court jurisdiction on writ of error to a state court, by some subsequent statute of the state which has been upheld or effect given it by the state court. Lehigh Water Co. v. Easton, \n121 U.S. 388\n, 30 L. ed. 1059, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 916; New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Ref. Co. \n125 U.S. 18\n, 31 L. ed. 607, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741; Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 109\n, 40 S. L. ed. 91, 93, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80.'\n\n In the case at bar there was no subsequent statute. There was a change in decision, it is contended, but against a change of decision merely  10, article 1, cannot be invoked.\n\n 2. \nIf the contract between plaintiff in error and defendant in error cannot be regarded as controlled by the law of New York, there is no foundation for the contention that full faith and credit were not given to the public acts and records of New York.\n A similar question was presented in the case of New York L. Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n, 44 L. ed. 1116, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962. The plaintiff in error in that case was a New York corporation, having its principal place of business in the state of New York. It maintained agents and examiners in the state of Missouri. One of these agents solicited Cravens, at his residence in Missouri, to insure his life in the company. Cravens assented, and made a written application for the policy sued on. The application was made part of the policy and contained the following provisions: \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 648]\n\u00a0\n 'That inasmuch as only the officers of the home office of the said company in the city of New York have authority to determine whether or not a policy shall issue on any application, and as they act on the written statements and representations referred to, no statements, representations, promises, or information made or given by or to the person soliciting or taking this application for a policy, or by or to any other person, shall be binding on said company, or in any manner affect its rights, unless such statements, representations, promises, or information be reduced to writing and presented to the officers of said company, at the home office, in this application.\n'That the contract contained in such policy and in this application shall be construed according to the laws of the state of New York, the place of said contract being agreed to be the home office of said company in the city of New York.'\n\n Four annual premiums were paid in Missouri. The fifth was not paid. Cravens died, and proof thereof was duly made. A controversy arose between the widow of Cravens and the company as to the amount due on the policy. Applying the law of New York, the company contended that there was due only the sum of $2,670 of paid-up insurance, and tendered that amount. The widow contended, applying the law of Missouri, for $10,000, less the amount of unpaid premiums, which left a balance of $8,749.21, with interest at 6 per cent from the date of the death of Cravens, and suit was brought for that amount. She recovered judgment according to her claim, and the case was brought here.\n Describing the contentions of the company, we said that they were reducible to one form,-to wit, that the statute of Missouri had been made by the supreme court of Missouri the measure of the rights and obligations of the parties against the agreement of the parties that the contract should be considered as having been made in New York, and should be construed and interpreted according to the laws of that state. The supreme court of Missouri decided that the statute expressed a condition upon which the company, as a foreign corporation, \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 649]\n\u00a0\n was permitted to do business in the state, and also expressed the public policy of the state which parties could not, by their contracts, contravene. We accepted that interpretation of the statute and affirmed the judgment.\n In the case at bar the supreme court of Mississippi gave the same effect to the statute of that state as the supreme court of Missouri gave to the Missouri statute. The court applied and followed the doctrine of Shannon v. Georgia State Bldg. & L. Asso. 78 Miss. 955, 57 L. R. A. 800, 30 So. 51, expressed as follows:\n'It must be remembered that the state has the power to prescribe the terms on which foreign corporations may do business. It is declared in  849 of the Code of 1892, last clause, 'such foreign corporations shall not do or commit any act in this state contrary to the laws or policy thereof, and shall not be allowed to recover on any contract made in violation of law or public policy.' This is the plain mandate of our law, which must be rigidly enforced by the courts. And the Code otherwise provides that ( 2348) domestic building and loan associations are excluded from the operation of the usury laws, but foreign building and loan associations are subject to them, and to enforce this public policy, thus declared by the statute, is not to give extraterritorial operation to our statutes. On the contrary, this corporation has come into the state, localized its business here through local boards scattered all over the state, and must submit such business thus localized to the operation of the laws of the state. To hold otherwise would operate the grossest injustice to our citizens, and would virtually abrogate our statutes against usury.' And again, on p. 974: 'Foreign corporations wishing to do business wit our citizens, and localizing that business vithin our state through local boards, must comply with the laws of this state. They cannot, under such circumstances, enforce here stipulations in contracts allowed by the law of the state which created them, if these stipulations violate our laws or our public policy. Such laws of such foreign states can have, ex proprio vigore, no extraterritorial effect, and it is not \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 650]\n\u00a0\n competent for a foreign corporation whose business has been localized in this state, or the borrower, or both, to abrogate, by attempted contract stipulations whose purpose it is to evade our laws against usury, the laws of this state on that subject.\n\n'This holding in no way interferes with the right of a foreign corporation whose business has not been localized here to make contracts with borrowers, to be governed by the laws of the state of their domicil, if there be no purpose therein to evade the usury laws of this state. Such liberty of contracting, exercised in good faith, is not herein interfered with. The authorities cited to that point by counsel for appellee are not pertinent to cases like the one before us. All the cases are admirably collected in a note to Bank of Newport v. Cook, 46 Am. St. Rep. 171. In that note the learned editor points out, on page 202, the distinction to be observed, saying:\n\n\"The proper answer to this argument is that mere shams and evasions are not permitted to counteract and annul the law, and where it appears that the purpose of the parties in making the obligation payable in another state was to evade the law against usury of the state in which it was executed, it will be regarded as infected with usury.\"\n\n These remarks bring the case at bar within the ruling of New York L. Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n, 44 L. ed. 1116, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962. The decision of the supreme court is, that plaintiff in error had become 'localized' in the state, had accepted the laws of the state as a condition of doing business there, and could not, nor could defendant in error, 'abrogate, by attempted contract stipulations,' those laws. See John Hancock Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Warren, \n181 U.S. 73\n, 45 L. ed. 755, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 535.\n In Chattanooga Nat. Bldg. & L. Asso. v. Denson, \n189 U.S. 408\n, 47 L. ed. 870, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630, we recognized the right of a state to impose conditions upon foreign corporations doing business in the state to the extent of holding the contracts of the corporation void which were entered into in violation of the conditions.\n There is nothing inconsistent with these views in Bedford \n\n[193 U.S. 635, 651]\n\u00a0\n v. Eastern Bldg. & L. Asso. \n181 U.S. 227\n, 45 L. ed. 834, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 597. In that case there was a consummated contract, and we held invalid a law enacted subsequently that made the enforcement of the contract depend upon the performance of onerous conditions. There was a question of usury in the case, but Tennessee, under the statute of which state usury was claimed, did not prohibit contracts which made the laws of another state applicable thereto. In that case, therefore, the law of the contract stipulated by the parties could be applied.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW v. TERRITORY OF OKL.(1904)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hugh T. Taggart and Culp & Giddings for plaintiff in error. \n\n[195 U.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Percy C. Simons for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n John T. New was tried on an indictment for murder in the district court of Wichita county, Oklahoma territory, found guilty, and his punishment fixed by the jury at imprisonment for life.\n The crimes act of Oklahoma provided that every person convicted of murder should 'suffer death or imprisonment at hard labor in the territorial penitentiary for life, at the discretion of the jury.' Okla. Stat. 1893, chap. 25,  13, p. 456; Okla. Stat. 1890, chap. 25, art. 17,  13.\n Judgment was entered on the verdict, and New was sentenced accordingly. He carried the case to the supreme court of the territory, and the judgment was affirmed. This writ of error was then allowed, and the objection is made that this court has no jurisdiction to review the judgments of the supreme court of Oklahoma in criminal cases, for want of statutory provision to that effect.\n By the 'Act to Provide a Temporary Government for the Territory of Oklahoma,' approved May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 182), 'the legislative power and authority of said territory' was vested in the governor and legislative assembly, and the power extended 'to all rightful subjects of legislation not \n\n[195 U.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.'\n Section 28 provided: 'That the Constitution and all the laws of the United States not locally inapplicable shall, except so far as modified by this act, have the same force and effect as elsewhere within the United States; and all acts and parts of acts in conflict with the provisions of this act are, as to their effect in said territory of Oklahoma, hereby repealed;' and by a proviso  1850 of the Revised Statutes, requiring the submission of territorial laws to Congress, was made inapplicable to Oklahoma.\n By  11 certain enumerated 'chapters and provisions of the Compiled Laws of the state of Nebraska, in force November 1, 1889, in so far as they are locally applicable, and not in conflict with the laws of the United States or with this act, are hereby extended to and put in force in the territory of Oklahoma until after the adjournment of the first session of the legislative assembly of said territory, namely: . . . and of part three thereof, entitled 'Criminal Code.\"\n This temporary provision was supplanted some months subsequently by laws passed by the Oklahoma legislative assembly. Okla. Stat. 1890. These statutes were elaborate and comprehensive, and embraced a crimes act, with due provision for procedure.\n Section 9 of the organic act reads as follows:\n'Sec. 9. That the judicial power of said territory shall be vested in a supreme court, district courts, probate courts, and justices of the peace.\n\n'. . . and the said supreme and district courts, respectively, shall possess chancery as well as common-law jurisdiction and authority for redress of all wrongs committed against the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the territory, affecting persons or property. . . . Writs of error, bills of exception, and appeals shall be allowed in all cases from the final decisions of said district courts to the \n\n[195 U.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n supreme court, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law, but in no case removed to the supreme court shall trial by jury be allowed in said court. Writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of said supreme court shall be allowed and may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the same manner and under the same regulations as from the circuit courts of the United States, where the value of the property or the amount in controversy, to be ascertained by oath or affirmation of either party or other competent witness, shall exceed $5, 000.'\n\n So far as review by this court is concerned, this is the usual provision, and is limited to civil cases. We are then brought to inquire whether any other statute may be invoked to sustain our jurisdiction.\n Section 5 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), provided that appeals or writs of error might be taken from the district and circuit courts directly to this court in certain enumerated classes of cases, among which were 'cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime.' By amendment the words 'or otherwise infamous' were stricken out, and it was declared that cases of convictions for an infamous crime not capital might be carried to the circuit courts of appeals. 29 Stat. at L. 492, chap. 68, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 556.\n By  6, the judgments of the circuit courts of appeals are made final in cases arising under the criminal laws.\n And  15 provides: 'That the circuit court of appeal in cases in which the judgments of the circuit courts of appeal are made final by this act shall have the same appellate jurisdiction, by writ of error or appeal, to review the judgments, orders, and decrees of the supreme courts of the several territories as by this act they may have to review the judgments, orders, and decrees of the district court and circuit courts; and for that purpose the several territories shall, by orders of the supreme court, to be made from time to time, be assigned to particular eircuits.'\n But the case before us is a capital case, and not included in \n\n[195 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n the criminal cases to which the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of appeals extends. It is suggested that, as it follows that if this court has no jurisdiction, convictions for crimes not capital are reviewable on a second appeal, while convictions for a capital crime are not, this involves an absurdity, hardship or injustice presumably not intended. We held, however, in Folsom v. United States, \n160 U.S. 121\n, 40 L. ed. 363, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222, that the intention was plain, and that the statute must be taken as it read.\n There remains the act of February 6, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 655, chap. 113, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 569), by the 6th section of which it was provided that 'in all cases of conviction of crime, the punishment of which provided by law is death, tried before any court of the United States, the final judgment of such court against the respondent shall, upon the application of the respondent, spondent, be re-examined, reversed, or affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States upon a writ of error.' As to this, however, it was ruled in Cross v. United States, \n145 U.S. 571\n, 36 L. ed. 821, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 842, that, in view of the terms of the whole section, the allowance of a writ of error to any appellate tribunal was not contemplated, but merely to review the judgment of the trial court.\n It is thus seen that there is no statute giving appellate jurisdiction to this court over the judgments of the supreme court of Oklahoma in capital cases.\n Reference is made to Queenan v. Oklahoma, \n190 U.S. 548\n, 47 L. ed. 1175, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762, in which we entertained jurisdiction in the absence of any suggestion as to the want of it. United States v. Simms, 1 Cranch, 252, 2 L. ed. 98, is an instance of similar inadvertence, and when cited in United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 172, 2 L. ed. 397, 401, Chief Justice Marshall disposed of it in these words: 'No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case.'\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK COUNTY NAT BANK v.

Massey, and Hill, Sturcke, & Andrews for appellee. \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, reversing the order of the \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n district court affirming the order of the referee in bankruptcy, allowing a claim against the estate of Stege & Brother. This claim was allowed against the contention of the trustee of the bankrupt, that it could not be proved until the bank should surrender a certain alleged preference given to them in contravention of the bankrupt act. The circuit court of appeals reversed the order of the district court, holding that the bank must first surrender the preference before it could be allowed to prove its claim. 54 C. C. A. 116, 116 Fed. 342. The circuit court of appeals made the following findings of fact:\n'For a number of years past the bankrupts, George H. Stege and Frederick H. Stege, were engaged, in the city and county of New York, in the business of dealing in butter, eggs, etc., at wholesale, under the firm name and style of Stege & Brother. On January 27, 1900, they filed a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in the district court, with liabilities of $67,232.49 and assets of $20,729.66, and upon the same day were duly adjudicated bankrupts. Among their liabilities there was an indebtedness of $40,000 to the New York County National Bank for money loaned upon four promissory notes for $10,000 each. The money was loaned to the bankrupts and the notes were originally given as follows:\n\n'April 26, 1899, $10,000, 6 months, due October 26, 1899.

'None of these notes were paid when they fell due, but were all renewed as follows: 'October 26, 1899, $10,000, 3 months, due January 26, 1900. 'November 26, 1899, $10,000, 75 days, due February 9, 1900. 'October 26, 1899, $10,000, 3 months, due January 26, 1900. 'December 2, 1899, $10,000, 69 days, due February 9, 1900\n\n\n\n'On January 23, 1900, in the morning, the bankrupts went to the New York County National Bank and asked the officers to have the two notes of $ 10,000 each, which fell due on January 26, extended. The bankrupts at that time informed the \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n bank officers that they were unable to pay the notes then about to fall due. In the afternoon of the same day, January 23, 1900, the bankrupts again called upon the bank officers, and at that time they delivered to them a statement of their assets and liabilities, which statement was not delivered until after the deposit of $3,884.47 had been made on that day. This statement as of January 22, 1900, showed their assets to be $19,095. 67 and their liabilities $65,864.61.\n\n'The bankrupts kept their bank account in the New York County National Bank since May 6, 1899. On January 22, 1900, their balance in the bank was $218.50. On the same day they deposited in that account $536.83; on January 23, 1900, $3,884.47; on January 25, 1900, $1,803.95, making a total of $6,225.25 deposited in the three days mentioned. Of this amount there was left in the bank account on the day of the adjudication in bankruptcy, January 27, 1900, the sum of $6,209.25, the bank having honored a check of Stege Brothers after the date of all these deposits.\n\n'At the first meeting of creditors, February 9, 1900, the New York County National Bank filed its claim for $33,790.25.\n\n'In its proof of claim the bank credited upon one of the notes which became due on January 26, 1900, the deposit of $6,209.25. The claim was allowed by the referee in the sum of $33,750.25, being $40,000 less the amount on deposit in bank ($6,209.25) and a small rebate of interest on the unmatured notes. Some of the creditors at this meeting reserved the right to move to reconsider the claim of the New York County National Bank; the referee granted this request. Afterwards the trustee, as the representative of the creditors, moved before the referee to disallow and to expunge from his list of claims the claim of the New York County National Bank unless it surrendered the amount of the deposit, namely, $6, 209.25, which had been credited by the bank upon one of the notes. The referee denied that motion, and an appropriate order was made and entered. The trustee thereupon duly filed his petition to have the question certified to the District Judge. The District Judge on \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n the 25th day of November, 1901, made an order affirming the order of the referee. From that order an appeal was duly taken by the trustee to the circuit court of appeals. The deposits were made in the usual course of business; at the time they were made Stege Brothers were insolvent.'\n\n As a conclusion of law, the court of appeals held that the deposit would amount to a transfer enabling the bank to obtain a greater percentage of the debt due to it than other creditors of the same class, and that allowance of the claim should be refused unless the preference was surrendered. This case requires an examination of certain provisions of the bankrupt law. Section 68 of that law provides:\n'Sec. 68. Set-offs and counterclaims:\n\n'(a.) In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor, the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set-off against the other and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.\n\n'(b.) A set-off or counterclaim shall not be allowed in favor of any debtor of the bankrupt which (1) is not provable against the estate, or (2) was purchased by or transferred to him after the filing of the petition or within four months before such filing, with a view to such use and with knowledge or notice that such bankrupt was insolvent or had committed an act of bankruptcy.'\n\n Section 60 provides (prior to the amendment of February 5, 1903):\n'Sec. 60. Preferred creditors: a. A person shall be deemed to have given a preference if, being insolvent, he has . . . made a transfer of any of his property, and the effect of the . . . transfer will be to enable any one of his creditors to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of such creditors of the same class.'\n\n Section 57g provides (prior to amendment of February 5, 1903): 'Claims of creditors who have received preferences shall not be allowed unless such creditors shall surrender their preferences.' [30 Stat. at L. 560, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3443.] \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n Considering, for the moment,  68, apart from the other sections, subdivisionsa contemplates a set-off of mutual debts or credits between the estate of the bankrupt and the creditor, with an account to be stated and the balance only to be allowed and paid. Subdivision b makes certain specific exceptions to this allowance of set-off, and provides that it shall not be allowed in favor of the debtor of the bankrupt upon an unproved claim or one transferred to the debtor after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, or within four months before the filing thereof, with a view to its use for the purpose of set-off, with knowledge or notice that the bankrupt was insolvent or had committed an act of bankruptcy. Obviously, the present case does not come within the exceptions to the general rule made by subdivision b. It cannot be doubted that, except under special circumstances, or where there is a statute to the contrary, a deposit of money upon general account with a bank creates the relation of debtor and creditor. The money deposited becomes a part of the general fund of the bank, to be dealt with by it as other moneys, to be lent to customers, and parted with at the will of the bank, and the right of the depositor is to have this debt repaid in whole or in part by honoring checks drawn against the deposits. It creates an ordinary debt, not a privilege or right of a fiduciary character. National Bank v. Millard, 10 Wall. 152, 19 L. ed. 897. Or, as defined by Mr. Justice White, in the case of Davis v. Elmira Sav. Bank, \n161 U.S. 288\n, 40 L. ed. 702, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 505: 'The deposit of money by a customer with his banker is one of loan, with the superadded obligation that the money is to be paid, when demanded, by a check.' Scammon v. Kimball, \n92 U.S. 369\n, 23 L. ed. 485. It is true that the findings of fact in this case establish that at the time these deposits were made the assets of the depositors were considerably less than their liabilities, and that they were insolvent, but there is nothing in the findings to show that the deposit created other than the ordinary relation between the bank and its depositor. The check of the depositor was honored after this deposit was made, and for aught that appears Stege Brothers \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n might have required the amount of the entire account without objection from the bank, notwithstanding their financial condition.\n We are to interpret statutes, not to make them. Unless other sections of the law are controlling, or, in order to give a harmonious construction to the whole act, a different interpretation is required, it would seem clear that the parties stood in the relation defined in  68a, with the right to set off mutual debts, the creditor being allowed to prove but the balance of the debt.\n Section 68a of the bankruptcy act of 1898 is almost a literal reproduction of  20 of the act of 1867. [14 Stat. at L. 526, chap. 176.] So far as we have been able to discover the holdings were uniform under that act that set-off should be allowed as between a bank and a depositor becoming bankrupt. Re Petrie, 7 Nat. Bankr. Reg. 332, 5 Ben. 110, Fed. Cas. No. 11,040; Blair v. Allen, 3 Dill. 101, Fed. Cas. No. 1,483; Scammon v. Kimball, \n92 U.S. 362\n, 23 L. ed. 483. In Traders' Nat. Bank v. Campbell, 14 Wall. 87, 20 L. ed. 832, the right of set-off was not relied upon, but a deposit was seized on a judgment which was a preference.\n But it is urged that under  60a this transaction amounts to giving a preference to the bank, by enabling it to receive a greater precentage of its debts than other creditors of the same class. A transfer is defined in  1(25) of the act to include the sale and every other and different method of disposing of or parting with property, or the possession of property, absolutely or conditionally, as a payment, pledge, mortgage, gift, or security. While these sections are not to be narrowly construed so as to defeat their purpose, no more can they be enlarged by judicial construction to include transactions not within the scope and purpose of the act. This section, 1(25), read with  57g and 60a, requires the surrender of preferences having the effect of transfers of property 'as payment, pledge, mortgage, gift, or security which operate to diminish the estate of the bankrupt and prefer one creditor over another.' \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n The law requires the surrender of such preferences given to the creditor within the time limited in the act before he can prove his claim. These transfers of property, amounting to preferences, contemplate the parting with the bankrupt's property for the benefit of the creditor, and the consequent diminution of the bankrupt's estate. It is such transactions, operating to defeat the purposes of the act, which, under its terms, are preferences.\n As we have seen, a deposit of money to one's credit in a bank does not operate to diminish the estate of the depositor, for when he parts with the money he creates at the same time, on the part of the bank, an obligation to pay the amount of the deposit as soon as the depositor may see fit to draw a check against it. It is not a transfer of property as a payment, pledge, mortgage, gift, or security. It is true that it creates a debt, which, if the creditor may set it off under  68, amounts to permitting a creditor of that class to obtain more from the bankrupt's estate than creditors who are not in the same situation, and do not hold any debts of the bankrupt subject to set-off. But this does not, in our opinion, operate to enlarge the scope of the statute defining preferences so as to prevent set-off in cases coming within the terms of  68a. If this argument were to prevail, it would, in cases of insolvency, defeat the right of set-off recognized and enforced in the law, as every creditor of the bankrupt holding a claim against the estate subject to reduction to the full amount of a debt due the bankrupt receives a preference in the fact that, to the extent of the set-off, he is paid in full.\n It is insisted that this court in the case of Pirie v. Chicago Title & T. Co. \n182 U.S. 438\n, 48 L. ed. 1171, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 906, held a payment of money to be a transfer of property within the terms of the bankrupt act, and when made by an insolvent within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, to amount to a preference, and that case is claimed to be decisive of this. In the Pirie Case the turning question was whether the payment of money was a transfer within the meaning of the law, and it was held \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n that it was. There the payment of the money within the time named in the bankrupt law was a parting with so much of the bankrupt's estate, for which he received no obligation of the debtor but a credit for the amount on his debt. This was held to be a transfer of property within the meaning of the law. It is not necessary to depart from the ruling made in that case, that such payment was within the operation of the law, while a deposit of money upon an open account subject to check, not amounting to a payment, but creating an obligation upon the part of the bank to repay upon the order of the depositor, would not be. Of the case of Pirie v. Chicago Title & T. Co., it was said in Jaquith v. Alden, \n189 \nU.S. 78, 82\n, 47 S. L. ed. 717, 719, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649, 650: 'The judgment below was affirmed by this court, and it was held that a payment of money was a transfer of property, and when made on an antecedent debt by an insolvent was a preference within  60a, although the creditor was ignorant of the insolvency, and had no reasonable cause to believe that a preference was intended. The estate of the insolvent, as it existed at the date of the insolvency, was diminished by the payment, and the creditor who received it was enabled to obtain a greater precentage of his debt than any other of the creditors of the same class.'\n In other words, the Pirie Case, under the facts stated, shows a transfer of property to be applied upon the debt, made at the time of insolvency of the debtor, creating a preference under the terms of the bankrupt law. That case turned upon entirely different facts, and is not decisive of the one now before us. It is true, as we have seen, that in a sense the bank is permitted to obtain a greater percentage of its claim against the bankrupt than other creditors of the same class, but this indirect result is not brought about by the transfer of property within the meaning of the law. There is nothing in the findings to show fraud or collusion between the bankrupt and the bank with a view to create a preferential transfer of the bankrupt's property to the bank, and in the absence of such showing we cannot regard the deposit as having other effect than \n\n[192 U.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n to create a debt to the bankrupt, and not a diminution of his estate.\n In our opinion the referee and the district court were right in holding that the amount of the deposit could be set off against the claim of the bank, allowing it to prove for the balance, and the circuit court of appeals, in holding that this deposit amounted to a preference, to be surrendered before proving the debt, committed error.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed; cause remanded to latter court.\n Mr. Justice McKenna dissents. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEWBURYPORT WATER CO v. CITY OF NEWBURYPORT(1904)\n\nArgued: March 16, 1904Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n The Newburyport Water Company, appellant, is a Massachusetts corporation created by special act on April 23, 1880, which act was subject to alteration, amendment, or repeal at the pleasure of the legislature.\n As authorized by its charter, the water company established a water supply system in the city of Newburyport. On August 17, 1880, the water company entered into a contract with the city to furnish water for fire purposes during a term of twenty years, with the privilege to the city of purchasing the waterworks property after the expiration of ten years.\n In the year 1893 the legislature passed an act (chapter 471) conferring power upon the city, if sanctioned by popular vote, to provide its own water plant, to supply itself and its inhabitants with water, and, if also approved by the voters, to acquire, by agreement with the water company, its plant. The voters of the city, however, decided not to purchase the plant, but to establish and maintain an independent water supply system. On June 14, 1894, an act, designated as chapter 474, was passed by the legislature, forbidding the city of Newburyport, in the event that the water company, within thirty days after the passage of the act, elected to offer its property for sale to the city, from acting under the authority of chapter 471 of \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n the acts of 1893, unless the city first purchased the plant of the company. A copy of the act is inserted in the margin. \n Availing themselves of the privilege conferred by this act, \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n the stockholders of the water company voted to sell to the city, and served notice to that effect upon the mayor. The city, by popular vote, decided to buy. The water company thereupon, on January 20, 1895, executed and delivered to the city a deed of all its property, both corporeal and incorporeal. In accepting the deed, however, the city served upon the water company the notice printed in the margin. \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n Under the deed of the water company the city took possession of the plant. The parties being unable to agree as to the sum to be paid, the water company petitioned the supreme judicial court for the county of Essex, to appoint three commissioners to fix the amount, which was done. Hearings were had and the commissioners made an award of $275,000, but no allowance was made for the franchise or right of the water company to lay and maintain pipes in the streets, and for its right to collect water rates, or for the profits which the company might have made on the contract for furnishing water to the city for fire purposes, had not the sale of the plant to the city taken place. It is stipulated by counsel that the commissioners did not value such contract, 'it being their opinion that the same in law could not be valued,' and that, although the water company offered the contract before the commissioners, 'no evidence of the quantity of water supplied to the city under the contract, nor any direct evidence of the cost of performing the contract, or of its value to the company,' was introduced. The stipulation also recites--\n'That counsel for the city, in his closing argument, asked counsel for the water company if he had waived the claim to have the contract valued, and the latter replied that he did not waive it, and was not prepared to say what use he should make of it. That thereupon counsel for the city proceeded to argue that the contract should not be valued; that the counsel for the water company, in his closing argument, mentioned the contract as one of the items of property which the company had parted with to the city, and urged, but not in this connection, that it was the duty of the commissioners to estimate the value of all of the property of the company as one whole.'\n\n The report on the award made by the commissioners was \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n heard before a single justice of the supreme judicial court, who reserved for the full court whether the award should be recommitted or be accepted. The full court affirmed and accepted the award of the commissioners. 168 Mass. 541, 47 N. E. 533. A rehearing was applied for, but while the petition was pending the water company brought the present suit in equity in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts. After the bringing of such equity suit the petition for rehearing was dismissed.\n In the bill of complaint the foregoing facts, except as to the recited provisions referred to as embraced in the stipulation, were set out with much amplitude, and it was alleged that no claim was made before the commissioners or in the state courts (except in the petition for rehearing) that the act of 1894 was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n In substance, the grounds for relief propounded in the bill were that as the act of the legislature which gave the privilege to the water company to sell had been construed by the supreme judicial court as not entitling that company, on the sale by it made to the city, to compensation for its franchises and other valuable incorporeal rights, that act as construed amounted to a taking of the property of the water company against its consent, without due process of law, and in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The bill based this contention upon the charge that, as the legislative act which gave the company the privilege to sell to the city, if it chose to do so, was coupled with the right conferred upon the city, if the company did not sell, to erect a water plant of its own, the sale by the company was compulsory, since the execution by the city of the authority to erect its own plant would have worked the ruin of the water company. In addition, it was charged in the bill that the failure under the legislative act, of which the company had availed itself, to value the future profits which the company might have derived from its contract to furnish the city with water, impaired the obligation of the contract arising from the \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n charter, in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. Charging that it was the intention of the city to issue bonds for the purpose of raising funds with which to pay the award in question, the bill prayed an injunction and the appointment of a receiver to manage the property claimed by the water company, which it had conveyed to the city, until the controversy was finally determined. The ultimate and substantial relief sought by the bill was, first, a restoration to the water company of the property which it had conveyed to the city, with damages for its detention, and, in the alternative, that full compensation be awarded. The city, appearing specially for the purpose, moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. This, after hearing, was overruled. Thereupon a demurrer was filed to the bill, which, after argument, was overruled. Application was next made for a rehearing on the demurrer, and pending action thereon an answer and replication were filed. The application for a rehearing on the demurrer was overruled. A motion was then made for leave to file a special demurrer to that portion of the bill and prayer in which a right to a decree for compensation was asserted. This was refused, and thereafter, by consent of parties, the following order was made by the court:\n'Ordered: That the constitutional question, to wit, whether or not the plaintiff has been deprived of its property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, be first heard; and that all questions as to plaintiff's relief, if any (including questions of valuation of the property alleged to have been taken) await the determination of the constitutional question.'\n\n Soon afterwards a hearing was had upon the question referred to in said order, and the decision of the court was adverse to the water company. 103 Fed. 584. After this the court heard argument upon the contention of the water company that the act of 1894 impaired the obligation of its contract with the city, and in consequence violated  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. It was decided that the \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 568]\n\u00a0\n failure to value the contract in question 'does not tend to prove that the act of 1894 was repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution.' The court, having thus decided all the constitutional questions raised by the water company against that company, entered a final decree dismissing the bill. This appeal, directly to this court, was then taken.\n Messrs. Robert M. Morse and Lauriston L. Scaife for appellant.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 561, 571]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert E. Pillsbury, and George H. O'Connell for appellee.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 561, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n At the threshold we are met with the objection, raised below and urged at bar, that the circuit court was without jurisdiction, because the bill on its face did not state a case arising \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 576]\n\u00a0\n under the Constitution or laws of the United States, within the intendment of the act of August 13, 1888. 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508). As the case is here on direct appeal from the decree of the circuit court of the United States, the solution of this question necessarily involves also deciding whether the cause was properly brought to this court. As the existence of the constitutional question is the only basis of the right to the direct appeal, if there was no such question in the court below there was and is no such issue by which the direct appeal to this court can be sustained. Under these circumstances, if the contention as to want of jurisdiction of the court below, arising from the alleged absence of constitutional questions, be well founded, our duty is not simply to dismiss the appeal, but to reverse the decree below, with instructions to the circuit court to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, ante, p. 63, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63.\n If jurisdiction is to be determined by the mere fact that the bill alleged constitutional questions, there was, of course, jurisdiction. But that is not the sole criterion. On the contrary, it is settled that jurisdiction does not arise simply because an averment is made as to the existence of a constitutional question, if it plainly appears that such averment is not real and substantial, but is without color of merit. Underground R. Co. v. New York, 193 U. S. -, ante, 494, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494; Arbuckle v. Blackburn, \n191 U.S. 405\n, ante, p. 148, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co. \n191 U.S. 358\n, ante, p. 82, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 82; Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, ante, p. 63, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63; Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 U.S. 487\n, 46 L. ed. 1005, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783; McCain v. Des Moines, \n174 \nU.S. 168, 181\n, 43 S. L. ed. 936, 941, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644, and cases cited. Whether the Constitution of the United States was and is, in a real and substantial sense, involved, depends upon apparently two considerations: First, the proposition that the sale made by the company to the city was compulsory, and hence there was a taking of the property in disregard of due process of law; and, second, that the failure of the commissioners to value the future profits arising from the contract for the furnishing for fires of a water supply to the city impaired the obligations of the company's contract. We \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 577]\n\u00a0\n say apparently two, since the questions are virtually one, depending both on the same considerations.\n Now, it is conceded that the charter of the water company was not exclusive, and was subject to repeal, alteration, or amendment at the will of the legislature. This being the case, it is evident that no deprivation of property without due process of law or impairment of the obligations of a contract did or could arise from the act of the legislature empowering the city to erect its own waterworks. Having this power, the legislature could therefore have exercised it without compelling the city to buy the plant of the water company, and the bill proceeds upon the theory that if this right had been exerted by the legislature the company would have been ruined, and the value of its property in effect entirely destroyed. This follows, because the averments are based upon the assumption that the conveyance by the company of its property to the city was not voluntary, since, if it had not so conveyed, the exercise by the city of the right to construct its own plant would have destroyed the company's property. The contentions, therefore, as to the Constitution of the United States, are based solely upon the proposition that because the legislature sought to protect the company and save its property from ruin by conferring upon it the privilege of selling its property to the city, if it chose to do so, thereby compulsion and consequent violation of the Constitution of the United States arose. In other words, that because there was conferred a benefit upon the corporation, which the legislature need not have bestowed, and which the company availed of, that its property was taken from it forcibly and without its consent. When the contention is thus reduced to its ultimate analysis, it comes to this,-that the property of the company was taken from it without its consent, because, by the action of the legislature, for the benefit of the company, it was enabled to sell its plant to the city and thus escape a serious loss. Indeed, in reason, the theory upon which the bill is based could not be maintained without deciding that the company had an exclusive contract, and there- \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 578]\n\u00a0\n fore, that there was a want of power in the legislature to authorize the city to erect its own plant; or, what is tantamount thereto, declaring that, although there was no exclusive right and therefore power in the legislature to give the city the right to erect its own plant, that body must have abstained from the exercise of its lawful authority unless it determined to exert it so as to destroy and ruin the company. The power being in the legislature, it was competent for that body to exert it for the benefit and in the interest of the water company, to enable that company, if it chose, to sell its plant upon the terms stipulated, and thus avoid the loss which otherwise, the bill avers, would have been entailed. And these considerations take this case out of the reach of the authorities which are relied upon as establishing that one cannot enforce a contract benefit derived from, or advantage gained over, another, by coercing his will by means of threats, even of the doing of a lawful act. The advantage resulting from the power conferred upon the company to sell enured to its benefit, since it saved it from a ruin which otherwise would have been occasioned. No compulsion in any legal sense can be said to have been exerted on the company by the option given it, because the exercise by the company of the option, upon its own theory of the case, saved its property from destruction. To indulge in the assumption that the action of the company was not voluntary would require the assumption that the company would have willingly suffered a most grievous wrong when, by accepting as it did the benefits of the act, such consequences were averted. The supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in passing upon the award made by the commissioners, aptly said (168 Mass. 554, 47 N. E. 533):\n'It must be remembered that the transaction before us springs out of a voluntary offer by the petitioner to sell upon the statutory terms, and therefore there is no reason to try to bend those terms in its favor. Of course, an offer by a water company, made under a threat of municipal competition, and to avoid ruin, might be voluntary only in name. But we have \n\n[193 U.S. 561, 579]\n\u00a0\n no reason to assume in this case that the petitioner is the victim of robbery, and must treat it as having acted of its free choice in fact as well as in form.'\n\n It is to be observed that in the legislative act which the company accepted, and in furtherance of which it voluntarily conveyed its property to the city, it was expressly stipulated that the value of such property 'should be estimated without enhancement on account of future earning capacity or good will, or on account of the franchise of said company.' It is also worthy of note that before the state courts the only question presented for consideration was the proper interpretation of the statute in question, and whether or not it provided for payment for certain incorporeal rights and franchises which the water company contended should have been allowed for by the commissioners. Having accepted the statute, conveyed its property to the city, provoked the state proceedings to value the property, and derived the benefits resulting from the legislation of the state of Massachusetts, the water company may not now, because of disappointment at the result of the interpretation which the statute received at the hands of the state court, change its position and cause its voluntary acceptance to become an involuntary one in order to assail the constitutionality of the legislation in question.\n Concluding, for the foregoing reasons, that the rights asserted in the bill under the Constitution of the United States, upon which the jurisdiction of this court depends and upon which, also, the jurisdiction of the lower court depended, were so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit, our duty is to direct that the decree of the Circuit Court be reversed at appellant's costs, and that the case be remanded to that court with instructions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n Chapter 474.\n An Act to Provide for the Purchase of the Property of the Newburyport Water Company by the City of Newburyport.\n Be it enacted, etc., as follows: Sec. 1. If, within thirty days after the passage of this act, the Newburyport Water Company shall notify the mayor of the city of Newburyport, in writing, that it desires to sell to said city all the rights, privileges, easements, lands, waters, water rights, dams, reservoirs, pipes, engines, boilers, machinery, fixtures, hydrants, tools, and all apparatus and appliances owned by said company and used in supplying said city and the inhabitants thereof with water, said city shall not proceed to supply water to itself or its inhabitants under the authority of chapter 471 of the acts of the year 1893, unless it shall have first purchased of said company the property aforesaid; and said company is authorized to make sale of said property to said city; and said city is authorized to purchase the same. Whenever said city shall, by a majority vote of the legal voters of said city present and voting thereon at a meeting called for that purpose, vote to purchase said property, notice of the desire of said company to sell the same having been given as hereinbefore provided, said company shall, within twenty days after the vote aforesaid, execute and deliver to said city proper deeds and instruments in writing, conveying to said city the property aforesaid, and said property thus conveyed shall thereupon become the property of said city, and said city shall pay to said company the fair value thereof, to be ascertained as hereinafter provided. If, at the first meeting, a majority of the voters present and voting do not vote to purchase said property, other meetings may be called and held therefor. In case the said city and the said company shall be unable to agree upon the value of said property, the supreme judicial court shall, upon application of either party and notice to the other, appoint three commissioners, two of whom shall be skilled engineers and the third learned in the law, who shall determine the fair value of said property for the purposes of its use by said city, and whose award, when accepted by the court, shall be final. Such value shall be estimated without enhancement on account of future earning capacity or good will, or account of the franchise of said company.\n Sec. 2. In case said Newburyport Water Company shall convey its property to the city of Newburyport, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding section, said city shall manage and use the property thus conveyed for the purposes and under the provisions of chapter 471 of the acts of the year 1893.\n Sec. 3. The said city may, for the purpose of paying the necessary expenses and liabilities incurred under the provisions of this act, issue from time to time bonds, notes, or scrip to an amount sufficient for such purpose; such bonds, notes, or scrip shall bear on their face the words 'Newburyport water loan,' shall be payable at the expiration of periods not exceeding thirty years from the date of issue, shall bear interest payable semiannually at a rate not exceeding 6 per centum per annum, and shall be signed by the treasurer of the city and countersigned by the water commissioners provided for by chapter 471 of the acts of the year 1893. The said city may sell such securities at public or private sale, or pledge the same for money borrowed for the purposes of this act, upon such terms and conditions as it may deem proper, provided that such securities shall not be sold for less than the par value thereof. The city shall provide at the time of contracting said loan for the establishment of a sinking fund, and shall annually contribute to such fund a sum sufficient, with the accumulations thereof, to pay the principal of \n such loan at maturity. The said sinking fund shall remain inviolate and pledged to the payment of said loan, and shall be used for no other purpose.\n Sec. 4. In case said city shall, in violation of 1 of this act, proceed to supply itself or its inhabitants with water before making the purchase aforesaid, the supreme judicial court shall, upon petition of said company, have jurisdiction in equity to enjoin said city from so doing until it shall have made such purchase.\n Sec. 5. This act shall take effect upon its passage.\n Approved June 14, 1894.\n To the Newburyport Water Company:\n In accepting the conveyance made to the city of Newburyport by the Newburyport Water Company, dated January 29, 1895, and delivered to the mayor on that day by the clerk of that corporation for examination, it is not admitted, on behalf of the city, that any franchise is acquired by the said city under such conveyance, or that the city is under any obligation to make payment on account of any franchise of said corporation by reason thereof.\n It is further not admitted or claimed that the four filters, with their gates, pipes, appliances, and appurtenances, described in item 2 of said deed as situated upon the second lot of land described in item 1 therein, are used in supplying said city or its inhabitants with water, or that the city is bound to pay for the same or any part thereof.\n It is further not admitted or claimed that the Newburyport Water Company has any right or authority to convey by said conveyance, or the city Newburyport to accept or make payment for anything whatever, except according to provisions of chapter 474 of the act of 1894.\n Adopted by a unanimous yea vote, six aldermen present and voting. \n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC R CO v. AMERICAN TRADING CO(1904)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n The Northern Pacific Railroad Company made a certain mortgage which was foreclosed, and the Northern Pacific Railway Company purchased the property of the former company under the mortgage at the foreclosure sale, and, by the order of the court, the purchaser was required to pay all boligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the court's receivers, who had been appointed in the foreclosure suit. The American Trading Company, the appellee herein, intervened in that suit, and, by its petition, asked that, by virtue of the decree in foreclosure, the purchaser, the Northern Pacific Railway Company, be required to pay damages for the failure of the receivers to perform a special contract for the transportation of goods from Newark, New Jersey, to Yokohama, in Japan. The case was tried before the United States circuit court, in New York city, which dismissed the petition. This decision was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, and the railroad company was directed to pay the damages therein stated to the American Trading Company, the intervening petitioner. The railroad company has appealed from such decree or order to this court. The case was tried upon the agreed statement of facts which follows:\n\n 1. \nIn September, 1894, Thomas F. Oakes, Henry C. Payne, and Henry C. Rouse were receivers of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, under an order made in a suit bearing the same title as the present suit, in the United States circuit \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n court for the eastern district of Wisconsin, to which this suit is ancillary. Under that order the receivers were authorized to continue, and were continuing, to carry on the business of the railroad in their charge.\n\n 2. \nThe line of railroad in the possession of the receivers extended from Duluth, Minnesota, to Tacoma, Washington. The receivers had contracts with various carriers reaching points on their line, by which through bills of lading were issued from and to points not upon the line of the receivers' railroad, where the freight passed over some part of that line in transit. Among the carriers with whom the receivers had such arrangements was the Northern Pacific Steamship Company. This was an English company, operating a line of steamers between Tacoma and points in Japan and China, including Yokohama. The contract between the steamship company and the receivers was the contract originally made on March 30, 1892, between the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, and ratified and adopted by the receivers, under the authority of an order of the circuit court of the United States, made on September 13, 1893\n\n\n The receivers held no stock in the steamship company, and had no other express contract relation with the steamship company. This stipulation is not to be accepted as an admission by the railroad company, or the receivers, or their counsel, that there were any relations between the receivers and the steamship company other than those growing out of the facts herein agreed upon.\n For convenience in transacting their freight business in the eastern part of the United States, the receivers maintained an office in the city of New York, which was, in September, 1894, in charge of one George R. Fitch, who was their general eastern agent, and made arrangements for the transportation of freight over the receivers' line of railway and connections, including transportation to China and Japan.\n At the time of the transactions referred to in this state- \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n ment of facts, the said Fitch had not received, nor did he receive, any direct or independent appointment or authority from the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, to act as agent of that company. His only authority as agent of the steamship company was that created by, or arising from, the contract, exhibit A. Fitch knew that an arrangement had been concluded by the receivers and the steamship company, by which contracts for through shipment to Yokohama might be made by the agents of the receivers, and through bills of lading issued, and he had been instructed by the receivers to solicit freight for through transportation upon bills of lading, of which exhibit C, hereto annexed, is a copy; but Fitch did not know the terms of the contract between the steamship company and the receivers, and the trading company did not know what company operated the steamships between Tacoma and Yokohama, or that the steamship company was a separate and independent company or that there was any contract between the receivers and the steamship company.\n It is further stipulated that Fitch had no express general authority to make contracts for through transportation, except as provided by the said bills of lading, and no authority to make the contract in question, unless such express authority be found in the telegrams, of which copies are hereinafter set forth; that the American Trading Company did not know the terms of his express authority, and that this stipulation is not to be taken as an admission by the railroad company, or the receivers, or their counsel, that his implied authority was greater than his express authority.\n\n 4. \nThe American Trading Company is, and was in September, 1894, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Connecticut, having its principal office in the city of New York, and carried on a general commercial business with Asiatic ports.\n\n 5. \nIn September, 1894, the trading company applied to Fitch for a rate upon a proposed shipment of pig lead from New York to Yokohama, Japan, and informed him that it \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n was of vital importance that the lead should be transported promptly, and go forward by the earliest possible steamer, without delay, in order to enable the trading company to fulfil a proposed agreement, which it was about to make for the sale of the lead in Japan, and which would require its delivery there at a fixed date. Fitch thereupon named a rate, and undertook to forward the lead from New York on or before September 29th, and via the Northern Pacific steamer Tacoma, sailing from Tacoma October 30, 1894.\n\n 6. \nThereupon the trading company cabled to its agents at Yokohama, naming a price, and a date at which the lead could be delivered there; and thereupon its agents in Yokohama made a contract for the sale of the lead, which contract provided that it should be delivered in Yokohama by overland route, and the most direct connection at San Francisco, Tacoma, or Vancouver, and that, in case of unusual or extraordinary delay in transit, the contract should be null and void. Neither Fitch nor the receivers knew, until September 24th, that any contract for the sale of lead in Japan had been concluded by the trading company, and, except as hereinbefore and hereinafter stated, they never received any information in regard to its terms, as made or proposed. Upon the conclusion of its Japanese contract, the trading company purchased 200 tons of pig lead in bond, from the Balbeck Smelting & Refining Company.\n\n 7. \nOn September 19, 1894, Fitch, in confirmation of his previous statement, wrote and sent to the trading company the following letter:\n Northern Pacific Railroad Company.\n Thomas F. Oakes, Henry C. Payne, Henry C. Rouse, Receivers.\n Geo. R. Fitch, General Eastern Agent, 319 Broadway.\n Traffic Department.\n New York City, Sept. 19, 1894.\n American Trading Co. 182 Front St., City.\n Gentlemen:--\n I hereby confirm rate quoted you this day, \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n and accepted by you on shipment of pig lead for export to Japan, as follows:\n Pig lead, New York to Yokohama, Japan, $15.00 per ton of 2000 lbs., shipment not to consist of less than 400,000 lbs., and to be forwarded from New York on or before Sept. 29th, in accordance with shipping instructions given you by me, and to be forwarded from Tacoma, Wash., via Northern Pacific steamer sailing from thence October 30th. Kindly forward your acceptance of the above as early as possible. Thanking you for the favor, I remain,\n Yours truly,\n Geo. R. Fitch,\n G. E. Agent.\n The trading company wrote and sent in reply (accepting the proposition) the following letter:\n Sept. 20th, 1894.\n The Northern Pacific R. R. Co., New York City.\n Dear Sirs:--\n In reply to your esteemed favor, Sept. 19th, we beg to accept the rate quoted to us in your letter of Sept. 19th, namely, on 200 tons of pig lead, N. Y. to Yokomaha, Japan, $15,00 per ton of 2,000 lbs., shipment not to consist of less than 400,000 lbs., to be forwarded from N. Y. on or before September 29th, in accordance with shipping instructions to be given by you, and to be forwarded from Tacoma, Washington, via Northern Pacific Steamer sailing from that port Oct. 30th. Kindly let us know as soon as possible the shipping instructions, so that we can forward them to our supplier, and oblige, with best respects,\n Very truly yours,\n The American Trading Co.\n (Signed) Frank P. Ball.\n On September 22, 1894, Fitch wrote and sent to the trading company the following letter, giving shipping instructions: \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n Northern Pacific Railroad Company.\n Thomas F. Oakes, Henry C. Payne, Henry C. Rouse, Receivers.\n Geo. R. Fitch, General Eastern Agent, 319 Broadway.\n Traffic Department.\n New York City, Sept. 22, 1894.\n American Trading Co., No. 182 Front St., City.\n Dear Sir:--\n I hereby confirm routing given you over the telephone yesterday on your shipment of pig lead for export to Yokohama, Japan, as follows: To be shipped from Newark, N.

Please advise me, as soon as possible, who the shippers will be, that I may order the cars, and also see that same are rushed through without delay to connect with our steamer at Tacoma.\n Yours truly,\n Geo. R. Fitch, G. E. Agent.\n A. H. P.\n\n 8. \nBefore naming a rate for the transportation of the lead, Fitch had expressed some doubt as to whether it might not be excluded from transportation as contraband, in view of the war then existing between China and Japan. In fact the shipment of pig lead was not prohibited by the Treasury Department at Washington during the war between China and Japan, and on September 25th, 1894, the trading company made another shipment of pig lead via Pacific Mail steamer sailing from San Francisco, which was, without trouble or delay, transported and delivered in Yokohama.\n\n 9. \nIn September, 1894, J. B. Baird was the second assistant general freight agent of the receivers and J. M. Hannaford was the general freight agent of the receivers; and telegrams of which the following are copies, relating to proposed shipments of pig lead, including the shipment in question, passed between the said Fitch and Baird and Hannaford, but were not disclosed to the American Trading Company: \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n New York, September 14, 1894.\n J. B. Baird, second A. G. F. A.:--\n Please wire quick lowest rate one hundred ton lots pig lead from Chicago and Duluth to Yokohama.\n George R. Fitch.\n September 14, 1894.\n Geo. R. Fitch, 319 Broadway, New York, N. Y.:--\n You may quote as low as sixty cents from Duluth and seventy cents from Chicago to Yokohama on pig lead in one hundred ton lots. Get more if possible.\n J. B.

New York, September 22, 1894. J. B. Baird, N. P. R'y, St. Paul, Minn.:-- Wire best rate two hundred fifty tons pig lead Duluth to Shanghai. Geo. R. Fitch. \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 447]\n\u00a0\n September 22, 1894.\n G. R. Fitch, 319 Broadway, New York:--\n N. P. Steamship Co. have now declined to handle lead for Yokohama, Kobe, Hong Kong, or Shanghai. Please cancel your quotation.\n 0.900.\n J. B. Baird. WDB.\n On September 24, 1894, Fitch informed the trading company that he declined to ship the lead upon the ground that it might be contraband of war, and thereupon on the same day, the trading company wrote him a letter stating that they would hold his company responsible for any loss from failure to fulfil the contract, which letter is as follows:\n September 24th, 1894.\n Geo. R. Fitch, Esq., General Eastern Agent N. P. R. R., No. 319 Broadway, City.\n Dear Sir:--\n Respecting your notice just received by us through your Mr. Post, that your company now decline to ship for us, via Tacoma, the 200 tons of pig lead specified in your contract with us, under date Sept. 19th, and confirmed by us under date Sept. 20th, we beg to advise that we shall hold your company responsible for any loss or damage we may suffer from the nonfulfilment of this contract with you.\n We remain, dear sirs,\n Very truly yours,\n The American Trading Co.\n (Gigned) Wm. H. Stevens, Treas.\n Thereupon, telegrams, of which the following are copies, were sent and received as indicated, in relation to the shipment in question, but were not disclosed to the trading company:\n New York, Sept. 24, 1894.\n J. B. Baird, N. P. R'y, St. Paul, Minn.:--\n Shipment, lead to Yokohama, is now being made; shippers \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 448]\n\u00a0\n refuse to accept withdrawal; we have given shippers written contract.\n Geo. R. Fitch.\n New York, Sept. 24, 1894.\n J. M. Hannaford, N. P. R'y, St. Paul, Minn.:--\n Have notified American Trading Co. that shipment will be refused. They state they will hold us to contract. They are shipping hundred tons from Denver to Yokohama by steamer City of Rio from San Francisco, Oct. fourth, and expect to forward this shipment same was; will charge us difference in rate. Advise quick.\n Geo. R. Fitch.\n Sept. 25, 1894.\n G. R. Fitch, 319 Broadway, New York:--\n Your wire this date to Mr. Hannaford: Dodwell, Carlill, & Co. have consented to accept the lead already contracted. Do not contract for any more. Advise quick number of pounds contracted by you and say how it will be routed. Think we should receipt for lead subject to delay.\n 0\/900.\n J. B. Baird. WDB.\n Dodwell, Carlill, & Co., mentioned in the last telegram, represented the steamship company.\n 10. Thereupon the refusal to accept the shipment was withdrawn, and the shipment was made under the contract, and the lead, consisting of 200 tons, was, in accordance with the shipping instructions given in Fitch's letter of September 22, 1894, shipped at Newark, new Jersey, in September 27th, 1894, by the Balbeck Smelting & Refining Company for the account of the American Trading Company. This was the first shipment ever made by the American Trading Company over the line of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and its connecting carriers. The shipment was made in bond, for exportation at Tacoma, and was secured upon the cars by government locks and customs seals. On the after- \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 449]\n\u00a0\n noon of September 27, 1894, the shipment left Newark, and started on its journey, and was transferred via the Anchor Line, a carrier operating between eastern points and points on the Lakes, to Duluth, and carried from Duluth via the receivers' railroad to Tacoma, which it reached in time for shipment by the steamship company's steamer, Tacoma, sailing October 30, 1894. On September 28th, a check for the freight upon the lead from Newark to Yokohama was handed by the trading company to Fitch, of which check, with its indorsements, the following is a copy:\n The American Trading Co.\n Check.\n New York, Sept. 28\", 1894. No. 6096.\n The National Bank of North America.\n Pay to the order of the Northern Pacific R. R. $3,360.05. Thirty- three hundred and sixty & 05\/100 dollars.\n The American Trading Co.\n Wm. H. Stevens, Treas'r.\n A. Proctor, Jr.,\n Cashier.\n Indorsements.\n For deposit in Ninth National Bank to Cr. of Geo. R. Fitch, Gen. East'n Ag't.\n Ninth Nat'l Bank, Indorsement, guaranteed of the City of N. Y.\n The amount of the check was credited at the Ninth National Bank to the account of 'George R. Fitch, General Eastern Agent,' which was the style of the account opened by Fitch as agent of the Northern Pacific Railroad; and the account was never drawn upon in favor of the Northern Steamship Company; but all through freights received \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 450]\n\u00a0\n were deposited to the credit of this account and remitted to the railroad company, or its receivers, and were divided and distributed by them under their contract with the steamship company.\n 11. On September 28, 1894, a shipping receipt for the shipment was issued to the Balbeck Smelting & Refining Company, of which shipping receipt a copy is hereto annexed marked exhibit 'B,' and was delivered by the Balbeck Smelting & Refining Company to the American Trading Company, and was forthwith surrendered by the trading company to Fitch.\n A bill of lading in the usual printed form, a copy of which is herein annexed marked 'C,' was subsequently issued by Fitch to the American Trading Company. It was received by the clerk of the trading company without stated objection to its terms, but was not read or examined by him, or by any officer of the company, and was immediately hypothecated with the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, as collateral security for moneys borrowed thereon by the trading company. The original of the bill of lading was negotiable and did not have stamped upon it the words 'Not negotiable; shipper's copy,' which appear on the shipper's copy hereto annexed, but was similar to the shipper's copy in all other respects.\n On September 29th, 1894, Fitch sent a copy of this bill of lading to Dodwell, Carlill, & Co., with a letter (not disclosed to the American Trading Company) of which the following is a copy:\n Northern Pacific Railroad Company.\n Thomas F. Oakes, Henry C. Payne, Henry C. Rouse, Receivers.\n George R. Fitch, General Eastern Agent, 319 Broadway.\n Traffic Department.\n New York City, Sept. 29, 1894.\n Dodwell, Carlill, & Co., Tacoma, Wash.\n Gentlemen:--\n I hand you herewith my B\/L 1507 covering shipment of pig lead for export to Amer. Trading Co. Yokohama, Japan. As I have previously advised you, I have made \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 451]\n\u00a0\n contract guaranteeing delivery of this supplement at Yokohama by our S. S. Tacoma sailing Oct. 30th. Will you kindly see that this connection is made without fail.\n Yours truly,\n (S'g'd) Geo. R. Fitch, G. E. A.\n The previous letter of advice, referred to by Fitch in the foregoing letter, is lost, and no copy of it exists. It appears, however, from the following letter of acknowledgment to have borne date on September 27th:\n Tacoma, Wn., October 2nd, 1894.\n George R. Fitch, Esq., G. E. A., N. P. R. R., 319 Broadway, New York.\n Dear Sir:--\n We beg to own receipt of and thank you for your favor of the 27th ultimo, and advising the engagement of 40 tons of condensed milk and 225 tons of pig lead for our steamer Tacoma, sailing hence the 30th instant. Please keep us frequently advised of freight engagements, as we have applications now for more space for flour than our steamers will carry, and we are shutting out considerable of the latter every voyage.\n Yours truly,\n (Sig.) p. p. Dodwell, Carlill, & Co.\n A. T. Pritchard.\n 12. At Tacoma the lead was delivered by the receivers to the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, and was loaded upon the Tacoma, the vessel of the steamship company which was to sail on October 30th; but about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of that day the deputy collector of the United States at that port refused to clear the vessel while the lead was on board, upon the ground that it was contraband of war, and telegraphed to the collector at Port Townsend for instructions. On the following day, which was the 31st of October, the deputy collector at Tacoma received a telegram \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 452]\n\u00a0\n from the collector of the United States at Port Townsend, which was as follows:\n'Department advises that, unless you have evidence tending to show that the pig lead at Tacoma, and referred to in your telegram of yesterday, is to be used in the war between China and Japan, no reason is perceived why shipment should not be permitted.'\n\n In the meantime, however, the master of the vessel unloaded the lead, which delayed the ship until 9 A. M. on the morning of October 31st, when he sailed without it.\n The petitioner was not notified of the delay in the transhipment of the lead until November 5th, 1894.\n The next vessel on the line was the Sikh, which did not belong to the steamship company, but was a chartered ship. Her captain declined to take the lead on the ground that it was contraband. The Northern Pacific Steamship Company cabled to the owners of the vessel in London, and they adhered to the position taken by the captain.\n 13. The lead went forward on the next vessel, the Victoria, on December 11, 1894, and did not arrive in Yokohama until on or about January 4, 1895, instead of on or about November 18, 1894, when it would have arrived had it gone forward on the 30th of October, 1894.\n 14. In the meantime hostilities between China and Japan had ceased, the price of lead had fallen very considerably, and the purchaser of the shipment refused to accept it, and declared the contract null and void in consequence of the failure to deliver it promptly in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n 15. The price of the lead under the contract would have been $38,610. 17. The lead was delivered to the trading company in Yokohama upon the surrender of the bill of lading, and, in consequence of the failure of its vendee to accept the lead, the trading company sold it for $11,331.60, which was the best price obtainable therefor at the time of the sale. The sale was made as soon as a purchaser could be found. \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 453]\n\u00a0\n The value of the lead on January 4, 1895, in Japan, was $11,906.16.\n 16. Upon the case arising on the foregoing facts, the American Trading Company has duly presented to the receivers, and to the Northern Pacific Railway Company, its claim, amounting to the sum of 26,704.02, with interest thereon from the 4th day of January, 1895, and has demanded payment thereof; but payment has been refused, and no part thereof has been paid.\n Mr. C. W. Bunn for appellant.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 439, 455]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. B. Jennings and Howard Van Sinderen for appellee.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 439, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The objections to the recovery, herein made on the argument, were--\n\n\n (1)\n That no contract was shown, on the part of the receivers, to assume any responsibility for the transportation of the lead beyond the line of the railway in their charge. \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 458]\n\u00a0\n (2) That there was no proof that the court had authorized the receivers to assume any such responsibility, and they could not do so without any such authority.\n\n\n (3)\n That if Fitch, the agent, made such agreement, it was not within his authority, real or apparent.\n\n\n (4)\n That the bill of lading is the controlling contract, and by its terms the receivers were not liable beyond their own line.\n\n\n (5)\n That the damages were caused solely by the act of the collector, representing the authority of the United States; and the receivers are not liable for damages so caused.\n In regard to the first objection, we think the fact agreed upon clearly show a special agreement for the transportation of the lead to Yokohama by the steamship of the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, which was to leave Tacoma on the 30th of October, 1894. The opening of the negotiation was made by the American Trading Company, which applied to Fitch for a rate upon the proposed shipment from New York to Yokohama, Japan. The trading company knew nothing of his steamship agency, and he was informed that it was of vital importance that the lead should be transported promptly, and go forward by the earliest possible steamer without delay, in order to enable the trading company to fulfil a proposed agreement which it was about to make for the sale of the lead in Japan, and which would require its delivery there at a fixed date. Fitch thereupon named a rate, and undertook to forward the lead from New York to Yokohama, on or before September 29, via the Northern Pacific steamer sailing from Tacoma October 30, 1894. The trading company thereupon made its proposed agreement through its agents at Yokohama. Although Fitch, the agent, was not thereafter specially informed of the fact that the proposed agreement had been made, yet he was informed that the company intended to make it if a rate could be agreed upon for the transportation of the lead. It is clear that his furnishing of the rate was with reference to the proposed agreement, \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 459]\n\u00a0\n and that he understood that, if his terms were accepted, he was entering into an agreement to transport to Japan the lead in question over the Northern Pacific railroad to Tacoma, and by the steamship which would leave Tacoma on the 30th of October, 1894. His letter of September 19, 1894, to the trading company, confirming the rate, is a plain agreement, not alone to deliver the lead in time for the sailing of the steamer, October 30, but an agreement that the lead should be forwarded from Tacoma, Washington, via the Northern Pacific steamer sailing on that day. Fitch in that letter asking the trading company to forward their acceptance of this proposed agreement as early as possible. On the next day, September 20, the trading company, by letter, did accept the rate 'for a shipment of pig lead, to consist of not less than 400,000 pounds, to be forwarded from New York to Tacoma, and from Tacoma via the Northern Pacific steamer sailing from that port October 30.' There is no doubtful expression in these letters. They form a clear and specific contract. It is entirely different from Myrick v. Michigan C. R. Co. \n107 U.S. 102\n, 27 L. ed. 325, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425. The receipt in that case was plainly not one which established a contract for transportation on the part of the railroad company (defendant) beyond its own line. This court held that while a company might, by a contract to that effect, be held liable for the transportation and delivery of freight beyond its own line, yet the contract to do so must be clear; and that the mere stating of a through fare on the receipt of the freight does not establish such contract or liability.\n In the case at bar we hold that a special agreement is set forth in the statement of facts, to forward to Yokohama by the steamer leaving Tacoma on October 30, 1894. If it had been made by the proper officer of a railroad company in the general course of business we have no doubt, under the authorities, of the validity of the contract. Ogdensburg & L. & C. R. Co. v. Pratt, 22 Wall. 123, 22 L. ed. 827; Ohio & M. R. Co. v. McCarthy, \n96 U.S. 258\n, 24 L. ed. 693; Myrick v. Michigan C. R. Co. 107 U. S. \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 460]\n\u00a0\n 102, 27 L. ed. 325, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425. Whether the fact that it was made by an agent of the receivers of a railroad company makes any difference will be discussed later.\n Appellant urges, however, that, as Fitch was also agent for the steamship company, his contract, if there was one, to forward by the steamship sailing October 30, was in behalf of the steamship company. Fitch had never received any direct or independent appointment or authority from the Northern Pacific Steamship Company to act as its agent. His only authority as agent of that company was created by the contract made between the two companies. By that agreement the railroad company was to have the exclusive right (with certain exceptions) to appoint agents in the United States, etc.; and the steamship company thereby authorized the railroad company and its appointed agents to act as agents for the steamship company, and to issue bills of lading and passenger tickets, and to make and name rates on all traffic for Asiatic points, etc. The trading company did not know what company operated the steamships between Tacoma and Yokohama, or that the steamship company was a separate and independent company, or that there was any contract between the receivers and the steamship company. When the trading company, therefore, applied to Fitch for a rate, they applied to him as the agent of the receivers of the railroad company. The letter of Fitch of the 19th of September, confirming the rate already given orally that day, is written on the paper used by the receivers of the railroad company, which paper is headed by the names of the receivers under the words 'Northern Pacific Railroad Co.;' and in it Fitch describes himself as 'general eastern agent,' and his department as the 'Traffic Department in New York city,' and he signs his name, and adds the words 'G. E. Agent.' In his letter of September 29, 1894, to the steamship agent at Tacoma, Washington, he writes on the same kind of paper, with the same heading, and describes himself as 'general eastern agent;' and in the letter he says: 'As I have previously advised you, I have made contract \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 461]\n\u00a0\n guaranteeing delivery of this shipment at Yokohama by our S. S. Tacoma, sailing October 30. Will you kindly see that this connection is made, without fail.' He signs his name, and adds the letters G. E. A., meaning, of course, thereby 'general eastern agent.' It is contended that, by the statement of facts, it appears that Fitch was acting for two principals, and that the plaintiff must establish that Fitch made the alleged guaranty on behalf of the receivers. We do not think he was acting in behalf of two principals. From all the facts, we think it plain that he was acting for the receivers of the railroad company. He was their general eastern agent; he was applied to, and he made his rates, as such, and as such he signed the letter confirming those rates, and containing the agreement to forward the lead on the steamship as already stated. Subsequently, and on the 29th of September, while acting and signing himself as the general eastern agent of the receivers, he writes to the steamship agents at Tacoma the letter in which he says he has guaranteed delivery at Yokohama, by 'our steamer' sailing October 30. All this shows the fact that he was acting as agent for the receivers.\n We have no difficulty in determining the capacity in which Fitch acted, nor that he made the special agreement, as contended by the trading company.\n\n\n (2)\n Neither do we doubt that the court had authorized the receivers to make such a contract.\n Under the modern methods of foreclosing railroad mortgages, it has been the custom to appoint receivers to take charge and conduct the business of the railroad mortgagor during the pendency of the suit. The possession of such receivers frequently lasts for years. It would be in the highest degree disadvantageous to all interested in the railroad company, as well as to the public having occasion to do business with it, if the same power which the company possessed to make special contracts for transportation should not be given to and exercised by the receivers of the company in continuing to run the road in substance as a going concern, so far as these \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 462]\n\u00a0\n kinds of contracts are concerned. Such contracts are not of the character spoken of by Mr. Justice Jackson in Chicago Deposit Vault Co. v. McNulta, \n153 U.S. 554\n, 38 L. ed. 819, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 915, as so extraordinary or unusual as not to be included in the authority to carry on the business of the company. On the contrary, this contract is one of the that class which we regard as so included.\n\n\n (3)\n We are also of opinion that Fitch had the right to make the agreement in question, and, if there could be any doubt on that point, nevertheless the agreement was in fact thereafter ratified by the officers representing the receivers, who had power so to do, Goodrich v. Thompson, 44 N. Y. 324.\n A railroad company has the power, as we have seen, to make such a contract of carriage beyond its lines. A general agent would be presumed to have such power. If the company have the power, some individual must exercise it. It would not be supposed that the board of directors would be consulted, and authority given by it every time such a contract was to be made. Who is a more proper or fit person to make the contract than the general agent of the company? He must necessarily have large powers in order to conduct the business of his office, and, prima facie, such power is within the scope of such agency. When the railroad company passes into the hands of a receiver, appointed by the court in a foreclosure suit, and the receiver is directed to conduct and continue the business of the company, the power to appoint general agents necessarily goes with the order to conduct the business of the company; and when the general agent is appointed by a receiver, he will be presumed to have the general powers of such an officer when acting for the railroad itself. The words 'general eastern agent' for a Western railroad company only limit the exercise of the agency to the place so described.\n\n\n (4)\n It is urged that the bill of lading constitutes the sole contract. But there was a plain, valid contract existing between the parties before the lead was shipped, and before any bill of lading was issued. That special contract was to for- \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 463]\n\u00a0\n ward the lead by the steamship leaving Tacoma on the 30th of October. The next day after the lead was shipped at Newark, a bill of lading was delivered to one of the clerks of the trading company, and that bill of lading contains the absolutely inconsistent statement that the carrier is not to be liable for any loss not occurring on its own road, and that the contract, as executed, is accomplished, and all liability thereunder terminates, upon the delivery of the property to the steamship.\n It is said that the trading company, by receiving this bill of lading and obtaining money on it as the representative of the property therein described, has acquiesced in the total abolition of the special contract the company made with Fitch, and has agreed that the railroad company shall be under no liability after the delivery of the lead to the steamship.\n We regard it as entirely clear that no such effacement of the original contract was meant by the receipt of the bill of lading. The railroad company had no power alone to alter that contract, and it could not alter it by simply issuing a bill of lading, unless the other party assented to its conditions, and thereby made a new and different contract.\n At the time when the bill of lading was issued the lead had been shipped at Newark, and had departed for its destination. It was impossible for the trading company to recall it. The particular conditions in the bill are set out in subdivision 3 and subdivision 12 of the conditions printed in small type, and they form part of numerous other printed conditions in regard to the freight received.\n Where the acceptance of the bill of lading, under these circumstances, is sought to be made an equivalent to an assent to the change of contract, it is proper to look at these facts in order to determine what weight should be given to such acceptance. At the time it was received the lead was out of the possession of the trading company, on its way West. That company needed the bill of lading as evidence of title to the property described in it, upon the security of which it \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 464]\n\u00a0\n desired to raise money, which it could not do without the possession of the bill. Under these circumstances, we refuse to hold that the trading company, in accepting the bill of lading, thereby consented to the complete alteration of its original contract, and without any consideration whatever, agreed to release the railroad company from all liability on that contract, and to take in its stead the reduced liability provided for in the bill of lading.\n Of course the company expected a bill of lading, for such an instrument is the usual accompaniment in shipping merchandise. The bill showed the amount of the lead, the marks and numbers, etc., and so identified the goods as to enable the shippers to show their amount and general value, and to enable them to negotiate the bill and obtain money on its security.\n It is agreed in the statement of facts that this bill of lading was received by a clerk of the trading company without stated objection to its terms, but was not read or examined by him, or by any officer of the company, and was immediately hypothecated with a bank as collateral security for the money borrowed thereon by the trading company. We do not state the fact that the bill of lading was not examined, for the purpose of insisting that an examination of such an instrument must always be shown before a contract can be predicated thereon. But where there is a valid contract already in existence, and it is urged that such contract has been abrogated or changed by the receipt of a bill of lading, after goods have passed from the control of the shipper, we think it is important, upon the question of whether such original contract has, in fact, been abrogated, to show that the bill was never read in fact; that the conditions abrogating the original contract were among a number of other conditions printed in the bill in smaller type than the rest of the bill, and that the alleged acquiescence of the trading company in the change of the contract, by virtue of these conditions, is based upon the mere reception of the bill of lading by a clerk without any knowledge of the existence of these conditions, and without evidence \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 465]\n\u00a0\n of any authority in him to consent to a modification of the contract already made by his employer. The fact, that, in such ignorance, that company hypothecated the bill of lading, adds nothing to the alleged acquiescence. what the contract meant as between the railroad company and the bank or other assignee of the bill of lading is not important here; but, upon these facts, we are unable to see that the receipt and holding of the bill of lading changed the original contract as claimed by the railroad company. See Bostwick v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 45 N. Y. 712, where it was held, under the circumstances of that case, the mere acceptance of a bill of lading did not alter a previously made oral contract in relation to the shipment.\n\n\n (5)\n Even if the receivers of the railroad company contracted to forward the lead by the steamer sailing from Tacoma October 30, it is still insisted that the action of the deputy collector, at Tacoma, in refusing to grant a clearance to the steamship while the lead was on board, made the performance of the agreement not only impossible, but unlawful; and, for that reason, the receivers were absolved from their agreement to forward by that vessel. The contract was not unlawful when made. It may be assumed that the lead was contraband of war; but that fact did not render the contract of transportation illegal, nor absolve the carrier from fulfilling it. It is legal to export articles which are contraband of war; but the articles, and the ship which carries them, are subject to the risk of capture and forfeiture. The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 283, 340, 5. L. ed. 454, 468. Neither any law of the United States, nor any provision of international law, was violated by the making of this contract, nor by an attempt to export the lead pursuant to its provisions. The case does not come within the principle of Brewster v. Kitchell, 1 Salk. 198, where it was said that, if one covenants to do a thing which is lawful, and an act of parliament comes in and hinders him from doing it, the covenant is repealed.\n No act of Congress was passed, subsequently to the making \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 466]\n\u00a0\n of the contract, which made it unlawful, and it was lawful when made. It is true that the sailing of the vessel without a clearance would have been unlawful, and the deputy collector refused to grant that necessary document while the lead was on board the steamship. But that did not render unlawful the contract to transport. He had the power to refuse to grant the clearance, and he did refuse unless the lead were taken off. In so doing he undoubtedly violated his duty. He was not justified in exacting any such condition for granting the clearance.\n Upon the facts in this case, we are of opinion that this refusal of the deputy collector constituted no defense to the action on the contract. It is not within the exception referred to by Mr. Justice Jackson, in delivering the opinion of the court in Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Hoyt, \n149 U.S. 1\n, 37 L. ed. 625, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 779. This contract, in view of all the facts, we think was made in contemplation of trouble arising from the character of the lead as contraband of war.\n The statement of facts shows that the question of whether the lead might not be excluded from transportation as contraband in view of the war then existing between China and Japan was fully understood before the contract was made, and after it was made, and the steamship refused to carry the lead, the trading company, upon being so informed by Fitch, notified him that they would hold the receivers responsible for failure to fulfil the contract; and thereafter, with the attention of all the parties directed to the subject, it was finally agreed that the lead should be received and transported, and the refusal was then withdrawn.\n It is true that the special and particular difficulty was first made by the steamship company which refused to transport the lead, yet, still, the attention of all the parties was, from the very first, directed to the peculiar character of the freight as contraband of war, and whether the contract should on that account be made, or, having been made, whether the shipment should not be refused. The receivers, therefore, knew \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 467]\n\u00a0\n that there might be difficulty in relation to the transportation, and yet, after full knowledge on the subject, they agreed to, and did, withdraw their refusal; and they thereupon took the lead for transportation under the contract.\n Under these circumstances, it ought not to be held that the mistaken action of the deputy collector in refusing to give the clearance should operate as an excuse for the nonperformance of the contract, which was not thereby rendered illegal. It cannot be affirmed that such possible refusal was not within the contemplation of the contracting parties when the contract was made. Many causes, it was known, might operate to obstruct the transportation of articles contraband of war. This particular form of impediment may not have been actually within the minds of the parties to the contract, but there was, as the agreed facts show, present to their minds the fact that there might be trouble in procuring the transportation of the lead because of its character as contraband of war, and in the light of those facts the contract was made, and, in substance, ratified after it was made. The railroad receivers took the risk of this, as of other obstructions, in making the contract, and they ought to be held to it.\n As the act of the deputy collector was an erroneous one, and a clearance should have been given while the lead was on board the steamship, we think his refusal should not be at the expense of the shippers, who had obtained this contract for transportation while all parties actually knew the difficulties that might concern the exportation of the lead from Tacoma. The state had not intervened to prevent the performance of the contract, as was the case in Touteng v. Hubbard, 3 Bos. & P. 291, where Lord Alvanley held that in such circumstances the party will be excused. In that case there was an embargo laid by the British government, after the contract was made, on all Swedish vessels.\n Here there was no intervention of the government of the United States. The exportation of lead was never prohibited by the Treasury Department during the war between China \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 468]\n\u00a0\n and Japan. There was no change in the law or the policy of this government subsequently to the making of the contract, by which its performance was excused. The exportation of the lead was legal when the contract was made, and continued to be so after the execution of such contract, although the deputy collector mistakenly refused to grant the clearance unless the lead was taken off the vessel. Such mistaken decision did not render the original loading of the lead on the ship unlawful, nor would it have been unlawful for the ship to proceed with the lead on board provided the clearance had been had. It was not an act of the state, therefore, which prevented the sailing of the vessel, within the true meaning of such a term, but a mistaken act of a subordinate official, not justified by law, and not sufficient as an excuse for the nonperformance of the contract in question under the circumstances already detailed. If the bill of lading were regarded as applicable for this purpose, the refusal of the clearance did not constitute a 'restraint of princes, rulers, or people,' within that clause of the bill.\n It was one of the contingencies of which the receivers undertook by their special contract of transportation to take the risk. It was not a contract that they should violate the law, but they took the risk of its misapplication, believing of course, that such contingency was most remote, and that, if the steamship company would receive the lead for transportation, the chief obstacle to the fulfilment of the contract would be thereby removed.\n After the lead had been unshipped, and within half an hour after the sailing of the vessel, the telegram which the deputy collector had sent to the collector in regard to the matter was answered by the latter in such terms that, undoubtedly, if the ship had been still in port, the lead would have been placed thereon and transported to Japan. The master, however, as soon as the determination of the deputy collector was given, immediately, and without appealing to the collector, unshipped the lead, and sailed for his destination at once. \n\n[195 U.S. 439, 469]\n\u00a0\n The result of the failure thus to carry the lead on that vessel was that it did not arrive in Yokohama until on or about January 4, 1895, instead of on or about November 18, 1894, which it would have done had it gone forward as contracted for. In the meantime, the war between China and Japan ceased, the value of the lead fell, and the trading company was damaged as stated in the finding of facts.\n We think the objections made to this recovery are untenable, and the decree of the court below is, therefore, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC R CO v. DIXON(1904)\nNo. 211\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 338, 339]\n\u00a0\n This case is before us on questions certified by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. The facts as stated are that Chauncey A. Dixon was employed on December 25, 1899, by the Northern Pacific Railway Company as a fireman in operating extra freight train No. 162, and while so engaged was killed by means of a head-end collision of that train with extra freight train No. 159. The company had made and promulgated time- tables for its regular trains, and had adopted reasonable rules for the operation of all its trains. The time-tables did not and could not provide for the running of extra trains. The company had in its employ a train despatcher at Missoula, Montana, who had general power and sole authority to make and promulgate orders for the running, on the division of the road on which this collision occurred, of those trains which were not governed by the time-tables. A large proportion of its freight trains on this division were run as extra trains, and the times of their arrival and departure were not shown on the regular time-tables, but their movements were made upon telegraphic orders issued by the train despatcher upon information furnished by telegraph to him by the station agents and operators along the line of the road. All these facts were known to Dixon. One of the rules of the company was: 'Operators will promptly record in a book to be kept for the purpose, and report to the superintendent, the time of arrival and departure of all trains, and the direction in which extra trains are moving.' The reports mentioned in this rule were made to the train despatcher, and he was vested with the authority of the superintendent to issue orders for the movement of trains.\n These two freight trains were running in opposite directions, train No. 162 going east. It arrived at Bonita at 12.35 A. M. and left there at 12.50 A. M. The local operator and station \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n agent at that place was asleep, and did not know of or report its arrival and passage to the despatcher. None of the crew of that train were aware of the fact that train No. 159 was coming west. The railroad had but one track. At 1.05 A. M. No. 159 reached Garrison, about 48 miles east of Bonita, and that was reported to the train despatcher. Thereupon he asked the operator at Bonita, by telegraph, whether No. 162 had arrived there, and the operator promptly answered that it had not. This question was repeated, and the operator was asked if he was sure that No. 162 had not passed Bonita, and he replied that he was sure that it had not. Thereupon the train despatcher issued orders for the movement of these two trains, which were sufficient to guard against collision if the information received had been correct, but as it was not correct, the movement of the trains resulted in a collision and the death of Dixon, to recover damages for which this action was brought. Upon these facts the circuit court of appeals certified the following questions:\n'First. When a local telegraph operator is called upon specially by a train despatcher to give information relative to the arrival of a train at his station, to enable the despatcher to formulate orders for the movement of other trains, does the local operator, in the matter of giving such information, act as a fellow servant of train operatives in such sense that the master is not liable to train operatives who are injured by obeying an erroneous order of the despatcher, that was induced by false information given by the local operator?\n\n'Second. Is the negligence of a local telegraph operator and station agent of a railway company in observing and reporting by telegraph to the train despatcher the movement of trains past his station, which causes the injury or death of a fireman of the company, without any fault or negligence the fireman, the risk of which the latter assumes?' of a vice principal, for which the railway company is liable in damages to the fireman or his personal representatives, or is it the negligence of a fellow servant of the fireman, the risk of which the latter assumes\" \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. W. Bunn, Emerson Hadley, and James B. Kerr for the Northern Pacific Railway Company.\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 338, 342]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. M. Antrobus, D. J. O'Connell, and R. J. Burglehaus for the administratrix.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justic e Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n A Servant is entitled to recover damages for injuries suffered through the personal fault or misconduct of his employer, but when the employer has been personally free from blame, and the injury results from the fault or misconduct of a fellow servant, it would seem reasonable that the wrongdoer should be alone responsible, and that one who is innocent should not be called upon to pay damages. And such is the \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 343]\n\u00a0\n general rule. But where the employer is a railroad or other corporation having a large number of employees, sometimes engaged in different departments of service, certain limitations or qualifications of this general rule have been prescribed. Perhaps no question has been more frequently considered by the courts than that of fellow servant, and none attended with more varied suggestions and attempted qualifications. It has been discussed so often that any extended discussion in the present case is unnecessary, and it is sufficient to state the principal suggestions, and consider their applicability to the case at bar.\n In a recent case in this court (New England R. Co. v. Conroy, \n175 U.S. 323\n, 44 L. ed. 181, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85), it was said (p. 328, L. ed. p. 184, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 86):\n'We have no hesitation in holding, both upon principle and authority, that the employer is not liable for an injury to one employee occasioned by the negligence of another engaged in the same general undertaking; that it is not necessary that the servants should be engaged in the same operation or particular work; that it is enough, to bring the case within the general rule of exemption, if they are in the employment of the same master, engaged in the same common enterprise, both employed to perform duties tending to accomplish the same general purposes, or, in other words, if the services of each, in his particular sphere or department, are directed to the accomplishment of the same general end.'\n\n Tested by this, it is obvious that the local operator was a fellow servant with the fireman. They were 'engaged in the same general undertaking,'-the movement of trains. They were called upon 'to perform duties tending to accomplish the same general purposes,' and 'the services of each in his particular sphere or department were directed to the accomplishment of the same general end.' The fireman who shovels coal into the fire-box of the engine is not doing precisely the same work as the engineer, neither is the conductor who signals to the engineer to start or to stop, nor the operator who delivers from the telegraph office at the station to the \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 344]\n\u00a0\n engineer orders to move, and who reports the coming and going of trains; and yet they are all working, each in his particular sphere, towards the accomplishment of this one result,-the movement of trains.\n Another qualification suggested is where the one guilty of the negligence has such general control, and occupies such relation to the work, that he, in effect, takes the place of the employer,-becomes a vice principal, or alter ego, as he is sometimes called. If an employer, whether an individual or a corporation, giving no personal attention to the work, places it in the entire control of another, such person may be not improperly regarded as the principal, and his negligence that of the principal. That thought has, in some cases, been carried further, and when it appeared that the work in which the employer was engaged was divided into separate and distinct departments, the one in charge of each of those departments has been regarded as also a vice principal. In Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 383\n, 37 S. L. ed. 772, 779, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914, 919, we said:\n'It is only carrying the same principle a little further, and with reasonable application, when it is held that, if the business of the master and employer becomes so vast and diversified that it naturally separates itself into departments of service, the individuals placed by him in charge of those separate branches and departments of service, and given entire and absolute control therein, are properly to be considered, with respect to employees under them, vice principals,-representatives of the master as fully and as completely as if the entire business of the master was by him placed under charge of one superintendent. It was this proposition which the court applied in the Ross Case [\n112 U.S. 377\n, 28 L. ed. 787, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 184], holding that the conductor of a train has the control and management of a distinct department. But this rule can only be fairly applied when the different branches or departments of service are, in and of themselves, separate and distinct.'\n\n So also in Northern P. R. Co. v. Peterson, \n162 U.S. 346\n, 40 L. ed. 994, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843, it was held that the foreman of a gang of laborers EMPLOYED \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 345]\n\u00a0\n IN PUTTING IN TIES AND KEEPING In repair a part of the road, although he had the power to hire or discharge any laborer, and exclusive control and management in all matters connected with their work, was a fellow servant with the men in the gang; and on page 355, L. ed. p. 997, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 846, the rule was thus stated:\n'The rule is that in order to form an exception to the general law of nonliability the person whose neglect caused the injury must be 'one who was clothed with the control and management of a distinct department, and not a mere separate piece of work in one of the branches of service in a department.' This distinction is a plain one, and not subject to any great embarrassment in determining the fact in any particular case.'\n\n Obviously there is nothing in this qualification which has application here. The negligent person was a local operator and station agent, and, in no reasonable sense of the term, a vice principal or in charge of any department.\n Another suggestion is, that the doctrine of fellow servant does not apply where the servant injured and the servant guilty of the negligence are engaged in separate departments of service. In Northern P. R. Co. v. Hambly, \n154 U.S. 349\n, 38 L. ed. 1009, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983, a common laborer was employed under the direction of a section boss in building a culvert on the line of defendant's railroad, and while so employed was struck and injured by a moving passenger train, the injury resulting solely through the misconduct and negligence of the conductor and engineer of the train. It was held that they were fellow servants; and in respect to this suggestion it was said (p. 357, L. ed. p. 1012, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 984):\n'As a laborer upon a railroad track, either in switching trains or repairing the track, is constantly exposed to the danger of passing trains, and bound to look out for them, any negligence in the management of such trains is a risk which may or should be contemplated by him in entering upon the service of the company. This is probably the most satisfactory test of liability. If the departments of the two servants are so far separated from each other that the possi- \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 346]\n\u00a0\n bility of coming in contact, and hence of incurring danger from the negligent performance of the duties of such other department, could not be said to be within the contemplation of the person injured, the doctrine of fellow service should not apply.'\n\n Applying this to the case before us, manifestly the work of the fireman and the operator brought the parties closely together in the matter of the movement of the trains. Dixon knew that any negligence on the part of the operator might result in injury to him, and must have contemplated such possibility when he entered the service of the company.\n It is urged that 'it is as much the duty of the company to give correct orders for the running of its trains so they would not collide as it was to see that their servants had reasonably safe tools and machinery with which to work, and a reasonably safe place in which to work,' and hence, that one who is employed in securing the correct orders for the movement of trains is doing the personal work of the employer, and not to be regarded as a fellow servant of those engaged in operating and running the trains. But the master does not guarantee the safety of place or of machinery. His obligation is only to use reasonable care and diligence to secure such safety. Here the company had adopted reasonable rules for the operation of all its trains. No imputation is made of a want of competency in either the train despatcher or the telegraph operator. So far as appears, they were competent and proper persons for the work in which they were employed. A momentary act of negligence is charged against the telegraph operator. No reasonable amount of care and supervision which the master had taken beforehand would have guarded against such unexpected and temporary act of negligence. Be fore an employer should be held responsible in damages it should appear that in some way, by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence, he could have avoided the injury. He cannot be personally present everywhere and at all times, and, in the nature of things, cannot guard against \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 347]\n\u00a0\n every temporary act of negligence by one of his employees. As said in Whittaker v. Bent, 167 Mass. 588, 589, 46 N. E. 121, 122, by Mr. Justice Holmes, then a member of the supreme court of Massachusetts:\n'The absolute obligation of an employer to see that due care is used to provide safe appliances for his workmen is not extended to all the passing risks which arise from short-lived causes. McCann v. Kennedy, 167 Mass. 23, 44 N. E. 1055. See also Johnson v. Boston Tow-Boat Co. 135 Mass. 209, 46 Am. Rep. 458; Moynihan v. Hills Co. 146 Mass. 586, 592, 593, 4 Am. St. Rep. 348, 16 N. E. 574; Bjbjian v. Woonsocket Rubber Co. 164 Mass. 214, 219, 41 N. E. 265.'\n\n Without discussing more at length the various forms and phases of the question of fellow servants, or the many suggestions which have been made to qualify or limit the general doctrine, we answer the questions presented as follows:\n First. The telegraph operator was, under the circumstances described, a fellow servant of the fireman.\n Second. The negligence of the telegraph operator was the negligence of a fellow servant of the fireman, the risk of which the latter assumed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concurred the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n As it is given to me to understand the ruling now made, it reverses many previous decisions of this court, and introduces into the doctrine of fellow servant, as hitherto applied in those decisions, a contradiction which will render it impossible in the future to test the application of the rule of fellow servant by any consistent principle.\n It is undoubtedly true that in many decisions of state courts of last resort the rigor of the rule of fellow servant has been assauged by an extension of two conceptions: the one designated as 'the department theory,' and the other as the 'doctrine of vice principal.' By the application made of the \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 348]\n\u00a0\n first of these in the decisions referred to the relation of fellow servant would not exist in any case where the servants were working in separate departments, even although engaged in a single enterprise or common employment. By the second, where even a limited suthority was possessed by a particular employee, such authority would cause him not to be a fellow servant with those over whom the authority was exercised.\n But the decisions of this court, whilst not rejecting absolutely either the department even a limited authority was possessed by with practical uniformity, refused to adopt the broad import given to those theories as above stated. Accordingly, it has been consistently held that the fact of separate departments did not destroy the relation of fellow servant unless the departments were substantially so distinct as to cause them to be independent one of the other to such an extent that the persons engaged in one or the other were not really employed in the same business. And so also as to the doctrine of vice principal: it has been uniformly held that it did not apply to every limited exercise of authority, but was only applicable in cases where the person charged to be a vice principal possessed such general authority and supervision over the business as to cause him in effect to stand in the relation of master to those employed under him. But whilst thus declining to fritter away the rule of fellow servant by a latitudinarian application of the department and vice principal theories, such theories have always been applied by the decisions of this court wherever a given case was embraced in the doctrine as expounded in the rulings of this court above referred to. Besides, it has been declared by an unbroken line of authority in this court that, wherever there rests upon the master a positive duty which the law has imposed upon him towards his servants, liability of the master for a failure to perform such positive legal duty could not be escaped by a resort to the principle of fellow servant, because, in an action for damage occasioned by the neglect of the master to perform such positive duties, the doctrine of fellow servant had no applica- \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 349]\n\u00a0\n tion. I content myself with referring to some of the leading and more recent cases of this court, establishing all the propositions which I have previously stated. Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 U.S. 368\n, 37 L. ed. 772, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914; Northern P. R. Co. v. Hambly, \n154 U.S. 349\n, 38 L. ed. 1009, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983; Central R. Co. v. Keegan, \n160 U.S. 259\n, 40 L. ed. 418, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269; Northern P. R. Co. v. Peterson, \n162 U.S. 346\n, 40 L. ed. 994, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843; New England R. Co. v. Conroy, \n175 U.S. 323\n, 44 L. ed. 181, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85.\n The inapplicability of the doctrine of fellow servant to a violation by the master of a positive duty resting on him, often stated in previous decisions, was reiterated in Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 U.S. 387\n, 31 L. ed. 781, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914, and was fully restated in Central R. Co. v. Keegan, \n160 U.S. 259\n, 40 L. ed. 418, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269, where it was said (p. 263, L. ed. p. 421, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 270):\n'We held in Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 U.S. 368\n, 37 L. ed. 772, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914, that an engineer and fireman of a locomotive engine running alone on a railroad, without any train attached, when engaged on such duty, were fellow servants of the railroad company; hence, that the fireman was precluded from recovering damages from the company for injuries caused, during the running, by the negligence of the engineer. In that case it was declared that: 'Prima facie all who enter the employment of a single master are engaged in a common service, and are fellow servants. . . . All enter in the service of the same master, to further his interests in the one enterprise.' And whilst we in that case recognized that the heads of separate and distinct departments of a diversified business may, under certain circumstances, be considered, with respect to employees under them, vice principals or representatives of the master as fully and as completely as if the entire business of the master was by him placed under the charge of one superintendent, we declined to affirm that each separate piece of work was a distinct department, and made the one having control of that piece of work a vice principal or representative of the master. It was further declared that 'the danger from the negligence of one specially in charge of the particular work is as obvious and as great as from that of those \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 350]\n\u00a0\n who are simply coworkers with him in it; each is equally with the other an ordinary risk of the employment,' which the employee assumes when entering upon the employment, whether the risk be obvious or not. It was laid down that the rightful test to determine whether the negligence complained of was an ordinary risk of the employment was whether the negligent act constituted a breach of positive duty owing by the master, such as that of taking fair and reasonable precautions to surround his employees with fit and careful coworkers, and the furnishing to such employees of a reasonably safe place to work and reasonably safe tools or machinery with which to do the work, thus making the question of liability of an employer for an injury to his employee turn rather on the character of the alleged negligent act than on the relations of the employees to each other, so that, if the act is one done in the discharge of some positive duty of the master to the servant, then negligence in the act is the negligence of the master; but if it be not one in the discharge of such positive duty, then there should be some personal wrong on the part of the employer before he is liable therefor.'\n\n And the Keegan Case was cited approvingly in Northern P. R. Co. v. Peterson, \n162 U.S. 346\n, 40 L. ed. 994, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843, and New England R. Co. v. Conroy, \n175 U.S. 323\n, 44 L. ed. 181, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85.\n With the rules thus conclusively determined by the prior decisions of this court, let me come to consider the questions certified, in the light of the facts stated in the certificate. Now, it is undoubted from those facts that the accident was caused by an erroneous order issued by the train despatcher in charge of the movement of all the trains, and it is equally undoubted that the fatal error committed by the train despatcher was caused by the neglect of an operator on the line of the railroad with whom the train despatcher communicated before he gave the erroneous order. To determine whether the doctrine of fellow servant applies to such a case it must be ascertained, first, whether the train despatcher was a fellow servant with those operating the train; and, second, if he was not, can the \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 351]\n\u00a0\n corporation avoid liability because the error of the train despatcher was occasioned by the wrong of an operator.\n First. Whether it be considered in the light of the doctrine of vice principal as applied in the decisions of this court, or from the point of view of the positive duties of the master, it seems to me that the train despatcher was not the fellow servant of the men running the trains. The despatcher was a vice principal in the narrowest significance of that term. He represented the master as to the operation and movement of trains over the road. He formulated and transmitted the orders by which all were to be governed. The duty to obey his orders rested on those in charge of every train, and upon complying with this duty of obedience on their part their safety, as well as the safety of persons employed on or moved by every train, depended. As the duties of the train despatcher were of the character just stated, it must besides follow, in any view, it seems to me, that in performing them he was discharging a positive duty imposed by law upon the master. For it cannot, in reason, I submit, be questioned that the law placed a positive duty on the master to furnish a safe place to work and to give such orders as would save those who obeyed them from loss of life or limb. The opinions of this court in the cases already referred to leave no room for question on this latter proposition, and there are other decisions not previously referred to which treat it as elementary. Hough v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n100 U.S. 213\n, 25 L. ed. 612; Union P. R. Co. v. Daniels, \n152 U.S. 684\n, 38 L. ed. 597, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756; Northern P. R. Co. v. Hambly, \n154 U.S. 349\n, 38 L. ed. 1009, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983; Northern P. R. Co. v. Peterson, \n162 \nU.S. 346, 353\n, 40 S. L. ed. 994, 997, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843.\n The doctrine of positive duty was applied to the determination of whether a train despatcher was a vice principal, and performed the master's duty, by the court of appeals of the state of New York, in Hankins v. New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. 142 N. Y. 416, 25 L. R. A. 396, 40 Am. St. Rep. 616, 37 N. E. 466, and was also applied to the case of a train despatcher by the supreme court of Pennsylvania in Lewis v. Seifert, 116 Pa. 629, 2 Am. St. Rep. 631, 11 Atl. 514. Indeed, elabora- \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 352]\n\u00a0\n tion to show that a train despatcher is either a vice principal or one who, in the discharge of his functions, performs a positive duty of the master, is unnecessary, since the opinion of the court in this case proceeds upon the assumption that such is the case, and rests its conclusion upon the theory that the rule of fellow servant applies because the error of the train despatcher was caused by the fault of the operator. This, then, is the real issue.\n Second. It being then established that the train despatcher was either a vice principal or performing the positive duty of the master, does the fact that his wrongful order for the movement of the train was occasioned by the neglect of the operator with whom he communicated give rise to the application of the rule of fellow servant? I fail to perceive how it can, if the principles which the previous decisions of this court have upheld are to be adhered to. Those principles are these: That where the act is one done in the discharge of a positive duty of the master, negligence in the performance of the act, however occasioned, is the act of the master, and not the act of a fellow servant. To say to the contrary, it seems to me, is to cause the decisions of this court to reduce themselves to two contradictory propositions: first, that a servant when injured by the act of another person cannot be allowed to recover by applying the broad construction given by many of the state courts to the vice principal and department theories, because the correct rule is the one which narrows those theories, and because, besides, the truer test by which to ascertain the existence of the relation of fellow servant is to determine whether the act done was one concerning a positive duty of the master; and, second, when a case is presented where the act complained of has been done by a vice principal, under the view adopted by this court of that theory, or involves a positive duty of the master, there may be no recovery because of the application of the doctrine of fellow servant to the case. The result being that recovery cannot be had in any event.\n The decisions of this court leave no doubt as to the true rule \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 353]\n\u00a0\n on the subject. In Northern P. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n116 U.S. 642\n, 29 L. ed. 755, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590, speaking of the positive duty of the master, the court, through Mr. Justice Field, said (p. 647, L. ed. p. 758, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 593):\n'This duty he cannot delegate to a servant so as to exempt himself from liability for injuries caused to another servant by its omission. Indeed, no duty required of him for the safety and protection of his servants can be transferred so as to exonerate him from such liability. The servant does not undertake to incur the risks arising from the want of sufficient and skilful colaborers, or from defective machinery, or other instruments with which he is to work. His contract implies that, in regard to these matters, his employer will make adequate provision that no danger shall ensue to him.'\n\n In Northern P. R. Co. v. Hambly, \n154 U.S. 340\n, 38 L. ed. 1009, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, thus approvingly referred to the Herbert Case (p. 357, L. ed. p. 1012, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 985):\n'The case of Northern P. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n116 U.S. 642\n, 29 L. ed. 755, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590, is an illustration of this principle. The plaintiff in this case was a brakeman in defendant's yard at Bismarck, where its cars were switched upon different tracks and its trains were made up for the road. He received an injury from a defective brake, which had been allowed to get out of repair through the negligence of an officer or agent of the company, who was charged with the duty of keeping the cars in order. It was held, upon great unanimity of authority, both in this country and in England, that the person receiving, and the person causing, the injury, did not occupy the relative position of fellow servants. See also Hough v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n100 U.S. 213\n, 25 L. ed. 612; Union P. R. Co. v. Daniels, \n152 U.S. 684\n, 38 L. ed. 597, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756.'\n\n In Union P. R. Co. v. Daniels, \n152 U.S. 684\n, 38 L. ed. 597, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756, an action for injury occasioned by the breaking of a defective car wheel, the existence of which defect had not been discovered owing to insufficient inspection, liability was sought to be escaped upon the plea that a sufficient number of competent inspectors had been employed. But, declaring the liability of the railroad company, the court said (p. 689, L. ed. p. 600, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 758): \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 354]\n\u00a0\n 'There can be no doubt that, under the circumstances of the case at bar, the duty rested upon the company to see to it, at this inspecting station, that the wheels of the cars in this freight train, which was about to be drawn out upon the road, were in safe and proper condition, and this duty could not be delegated so as to exonerate the company from liability to its servants for injuries resulting from the omission to perform that duty, or through its negligent performance.'\n Again, in Northern P. R. Co. v. Peterson, \n162 U.S. 346\n, 40 L. ed. 994, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843, speaking through Mr. Justice Peckham of the positive duties of the master, the court said (p. 353, L. ed. p. 997, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 845):\n'He owes the duty to provide such servant with a reasonably safe place to work in, having reference to the character of the employment in which the servant is engaged. He also owes the duty of providing reasonably safe tools, appliances, and machinery for the accomplishment of the work necessary to be done. He must exercise proper diligence in the employment of reasonably safe and competent men to perform their respective duties, and it has been held in many states that the master owes the further duty of adopting and promulgating safe and proper rules for the conduct of his business, including the government of the machinery, and the running of trains on a railroad track. If the master be neglectful in any of these matters, it is a neglect of a duty which he personally owes to his employees, and if the employee suffer damage on account thereof, the master is liable. If, instead of personally performing these obligations, the master engages another to do them for him, he is liable for the neglect of that other, which, in such case, is not the neglect of a fellow servant, no matter what his position as to other matters, but is the neglect of the master to do those things which it is the duty of the master to perform as such.'\n\n And these principles have been applied by the court of appeals of the state of New York to a case like the one at bar. Dana v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 92 N. Y. 639. In that case, in communicating verbally to a conductor an order received from \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 355]\n\u00a0\n the train despatcher, an error was committed by one Keifer, a telegraph operator, and a collision between trains resulted. In the course of the opinion, reversing the judgment which had been entered in favor of the railroad company, the court said (p. 642):\n'For Keifer's act, in this respect, the defendant is clearly liable. The act he was required to do, and did perform, was one for which the master was responsible as a duty pertaining to itself, and as to it Keifer occupied the place of the master. Flike v. Boston & A. R. Co. 53 N. Y. 549, 13 Am. Rep. 545.'\n\n Nor do I perceive the pertinency, as applied to the facts in the case at bar, of the extract made from the opinion of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts in the case of Whittaker v. Bent, 167 Mass. 588, 589, 46 N. E. 121. The doctrine of transitory risk, as expounded in the case referred to and in previous cases in Massachusetts which that case followed, really amounts only to this: that where the work is of such a character that dangers which cannot be foreseen or guarded against by the master may, in the nature of things, suddenly and unexpectedly arise, there is no neglect of a positive duty owing by the master in failing, by himself or the agencies he employs, to anticipate and protect against that which the utmost care on his part could not have prevented. But this doctrine can have no application to a case like the one in hand, where the damage was occasioned by an act of obvious neglect in the performance of a positive duty.\n That the doctrine of transitory risk applied in the Massachusetts cases relied upon has no application here, it seems to me, is made clear by the fact that it is stated in the certificate that the trains in question were extra trains, obliged by the rules of the company to run on no preordained schedule, and solely under the command of the despatcher, and that, to quote the certificate, 'a large proportion of its freight trains on this division were run as extra trains, and the times of their arrivals and departures were not shown on the regular time-tables, but \n\n[194 U.S. 338, 356]\n\u00a0\n their movements were made upon telegraphic orders issued by the train despatcher upon information furnished by telegraph to the train despatcher by its station agents and operators along the line of the railroad.' To apply the transitory risk theory to this condition of affairs, it seems to me, is to say that the methed permanently adopted by the company for running the class of trains in question is to be governed, not by that fact, but by the fictitious assumption that the trains were temporarily operated by wire alone. The consequence of the application of the doctrine of transitory risk to the condition of affairs shown in the certificate is, as I understand it, but to say that a railroad which chooses to operate its trains solely through orders of the train despatcher is a licensed wrongdoer as respects its employees, since thereby it is exempt from those rules of positive duty which the law would otherwise impose. The result is, besides, to decide that if a railroad adopts a regular schedule the law casts a positive duty on it as regards its employees, but that it may escape all such duty on the theory of transitory risk, if only the road elects to adopt no schedule, and to operate its trains solely by telegraph.\n For the foregoing reasons I dissent.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC. RY. CO. v. ADAMS(1904)\nNo. 413\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n A statute of Idaho reads as follows:\n'When the death of a person, not being a minor, is caused \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 441]\n\u00a0\n by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his heirs or personal representatives damages against the person causing the death; or, if such person be employed by another person who is responsible for his conduct, then also against such other person. In every action under this and the preceding section, such damages may be given as, under all the circumstances of the case, may be just.' Idaho Rev. Stat.  4100\n\n\n\n Jay H. Adams resided in Spokane, Washington. He was a lawyer and the attorney of several railway companies, though not in the employ of petitioner. He was a frequent traveler on petitioner's and other railways. On November 13, 1898, he, with a friend, started on one of petitioner's trains from Hope, Idaho, to Spokane. The train consisted of an engine and eight cars, those behind the express car being in the following order: smoking car, day coach, tourist sleeper, dining car, Pullman sleeper. All were vestibuled except the tourist sleeper immediately in front of the dining car. It had open platforms, as an ordinary passenger coach. Shortly after leaving Hope, Mr. Adams, then in the smoking car, went back to the dining car for cigars. To reach the dining car he passed through the day coach and the tourist sleeper. After buying cigars he left the dining car and went forward. This was the last seen of him alive. His body was found the next day opposite a curve in the railroad track about six miles west of Hope. There was no direct testimony as to how he got off the train, whether by an accidental stumble, or by being thrown therefrom through the lurching of the train, which was going at a high rate of speed. The road from Hope to the place where the body was found is in Idaho. He was riding on a free pass containing these provisions: Conditions.\n This free ticket is not transferable, and, if presented by another person than the individual named thereon, or if any alteration, addition, or erasure is made upon it, it is forfeited, and the conductor will take it up and collect full fare. \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n The person accepting this free ticket agrees that the Northern Pacific Railway Company shall not be liable, under any circumstances, whether of negligence of agents or otherwise, for any injury to the person, or for any loss or damage to the property, of the passenger using the same.\n I accept the above conditions. Jay H. Adams.\n This pass will not be honored unless signed in ink by the person for whom issued.\n This action was brought by the plaintiffs, the widow and son of the deceased, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Washington. Verdict and judgment were in their favor for $14,000, which were sustained by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit (54 C. C. A. 196, 116 Fed. 324), and thereupon the case was brought here on a writ of certiorari. \n187 U.S. 643\n, 47 L. ed. 346, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856.\n Mr. C. W. Bunn for petitioner.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Reese H. Voorhees and C. S. Voorhees for respondents.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 440, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n As the negligence of the company, found by the jury to have \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 449]\n\u00a0\n caused the death, as well as the resulting death, took place in ldaho, the plaintiffs' right of action rests on the statute of that state. What is the scope and meaning of that statute? The circuit court charged the jury:\n'You are not to consider what was the duty of this carrier toward Mr. Adams who was killed, but the duty which the defendant owed to these plaintiffs; and the duty which they have the right to exact from the defendant in this case is the same duty which the defendant company owed to the public in general.'\n\n In other words, although it should appear that the company in no respect failed in its duty to the deceased, it could yet be held responsible to the widow and son for the damages they suffered by reason of the death. But that is a misconception. Their right of action arises only when his death is caused by 'the wrongful act or neglect.' If there be no omission of duty to the decedent, his heirs have no claim. Suppose an individual is wantonly assailed, and, in order to protect his own life, is obliged to kill the assailant,-may the heirs of the decedent have that act of taking life, rightful as against the decedent, adjudged wrongful as against them, and recover damages from one who did only that which his duty to himself and family required him to do? The statute does not provide that when one's life is taken by another the heirs of the former may recover damages, but only when it is wrongfully taken,-that is, when it is taken in violation of the rights of the decedent; wrongful as against him. 'Neglect' stands in the same category with 'wrongful act.' It implies some omission of duty. The trial court in this case charged the jury:\n'Negligence, to create a liability on the part of parties in fault, must be a failure to observe the degree of care and prudence that is demanded in the discharge of the duty which the person charged with the negligence owed under the peculiar circumstances of the case to the injured party.'\n\n As stated in Pollock on Torts, p. 355, quoting from Baron \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 450]\n\u00a0\n Alderson in Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co. 11 Exch. 784, 25 L. J. Exch. N. S. 213:\n\"Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do,' provided, of course, that the party whose conduct is in question is already in a situation that brings him under the duty of taking care.'\n\n The two terms, therefore,-wrongful act and neglect,-imply alike the omission of some duty, and that duty must, as stated, be a duty owing to the decedent. It cannot be that, if the death was caused by a rightful act, or an unintentional act, with no omission of duty owing to the decedent, it can be considered wrongful or negligent at the suit of the heirs of the decedent. They claim under him, and they can recover only in case he could have recovered damages had he not been killed, but only injured. The company is not under two different measures of obligation,-one to the passenger and another to his heirs. If it discharges its full obligation to the passenger, his heirs have no right to compel it to pay damages.\n Did the company omit any duty which they owed to the decedent? He was riding on a pass which provided that the company should 'not be liable, under any circumstances, whether of negligence of agents or otherwise, for any injury to the person.' He was a free passenger, paying nothing for the privilege given him of riding in the coaches of the defendant. He entered those coaches as a licensee, upon conditions which he, with full knowledge, accepted. He was not a passenger for hire, such as was held to be the condition of the parties recovering in New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. ed. 627, and Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Stevens, \n95 U.S. 655\n, 24 L. ed. 535. In the first of these cases Mr. Justice Bradley, who delivered the opinion of the court, closed an elaborate discussion of the questions with these words:\n'We purposely abstain from expressing any opinion as to \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 451]\n\u00a0\n what would have been the result of our judgment had we considered the plaintiff a free passenger instead of a passenger for hire.'\n\n The question, then, is distinctly presented whether a railroad company is liable in damages to a person injured through the negligence of its employees, who at the time is riding on a pass given as a gratuity, and upon the condition, known to and accepted by him, that it shall not be responsible for such injuries. It will be perceived that the question excludes injuries resulting from wilful or wanton acts, but applies only to cases of ordinary negligence. The facts of this case certainly do not call for any broader inquiry than this. The specific matters of negligence charged are the placing a nonvestibuled car in a vestibuled train, and the high rate of speed at which the train passed around the curve at the place of injury. But nonvestibuled cars are in constant use all over the country,- were the only cars in use up to a few years ago,-and further, the deceased, having passed over the open platform, knew exactly its condition. As the court charged the jury:-'Mr. Adams must be presumed to have known that it was not vestibuled, and to have acted with perfect knowledge of the fact.' The rate of speed was no greater than is common on other trains everywhere in the land, and the train was, in fact, run safely on this occasion. We shall assume however, but without deciding that the jury were warranted considering the absence of the vestibuled platform and the high rate of speed in coming around the curve, in finding the company guilty of negligence; but clearly it was not acting either wilfully or wantonly in running its trains at this not uncommon rate of speed, and all that can at most be said is that there was ordinary negligence. Is the company responsible for injuries resulting from ordinary negligence to an individual whom it permies to ride without charge on condition that he take all the risks of such negligence?\n This question has received the consideration of many courts, and been answered in different and opposing ways. We shall \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 452]\n\u00a0\n not attempt to review the cases in state courts. Among those which hold that the company is not responsible may be mentioned Rogers v. Kennebec S. B. Co. 86 Me. 261, 25 L. R. A. 491, 29 Atl. 1069; Quimby v. Boston & M. R. Co. 150 Mass. 365, 5 L. R. A. 846, 23 N. E. 205; Griswold v. New York & N. E. R. Co. 53 Conn. 371, 55 Am.

Co. 7 Wash. 528, 22 L. R. A. 794, 35 Pac. 422, 10 Wash. 311, 38 Pac. 995. This last case was decided by the supreme court of the state, in which the Federal court rendering the judgment in controversy was held. the English decisions are to the same effect. McCawley v. Furness R. Co. L. R. 8 Q. B. 57; Hall v. North Eastern R. Co. L. R. 10 Q. B. 437; Duff v. Great Northern R. Co. Ir. L. R. 4 C. L. 178; Alexander v. Toronto & N. R. Co. 33 U. C. Q. B. 474. Among those holding that the company is responsible are: Rose v. Des Moines Valley R. Co. 39 Iowa, 246, though that case is rested partially on a state statute; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Butler, 57 Pa. 335; Mobile & O. R. Co. v. Hopkins, 41 Ala. 486, 94 Am. Dec. 607; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. McGown, 65 Tex. 640.\n Turning to the decisions of this court, in Philadelphia & R. R. Co. v. Derby, 14 How. 468, 14 L. ed. 502, and The New World v. King, 16 How. 469, 14 L. ed. 1019, the parties injured were free passengers, but it does not appear that there were any stipulations concerning the risk of negligence, and the companies were held guilty of gross negligence. In Baltimore & O. S. W. R. Co. v. Voigt, \n176 U.S. 498\n, 44 L. ed. 560, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385, Voigt, an express messenger riding in a car set apart for the use of an express company, was injured by the negligence of the railway company. There was an agreement between the two companies that the former would hold the railway company free from all liability for negligence, whether caused by the negligence of the railway company or its employees. Voigt, entering into the employ of the express company, signed a contract in writ- \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 453]\n\u00a0\n ing, whereby he agreed to assume all the risk of accident or injury in the course of his employment, whether occasioned by negligence or otherwise, and expressly ratified the agreement between the express company and the railway company. It was held that he could not maintain an action against the railway company for injuries resulting from the negligence of its employees. Mr. Justice Shiras, who delivered the opinion of the court, reviewed many state decisions, and concluded with these words (p. 520, L. ed. p. 570, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 393):\n'Without enumerating and appraising all the cases respectively cited, our conclusion is that Voigt, occupying an express car as a messenger in charge of express matter, in pursuance of the contract between the companies, was not a passenger within the meaning of the case of New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. ed. 627; that he was not constrained to enter into the contract whereby the railroad company was exonerated from liability to him, but entered into the same freely and voluntarily, and obtained the benefit of it by securing his appointment as such messenger, and that such a contract did not contravene public policy.'\n\n In the light of this decision but one answer can be made to the question. The railway company was not, as to Adams, a carrier for hire. It waived its right as a common carrier to exact compensation. It offered him the privilege of riding in its coaches without charge if he would assume the risks of negligence. He was not in the power of the company and obliged to accept its terms. They stood on an equal footing. If he had desired to hold it to its common-law obligations to him as a passenger, he could have paid his fare and compelled the company to receive and carry him. He freely and voluntarily chose to accept the privilege offered; and, having accepted that privilege, cannot repudiate the conditions. It was not a benevolent association, but doing a railroad business for profit; and free passengers are not so many as to induce negligence on its part. So far as the element of contract controls, it was a contract which neither party was bound to enter into, \n\n[192 U.S. 440, 454]\n\u00a0\n and yet one which each was at liberty to make, and no public policy was violated thereby.\n It follows from these considerations that there was error in the proceedings of the Circuit Court and Court of Appeals. The judgments of those courts will be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit court, with instructions to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice McKenna dissent. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN SECURITIES CO. v.

Grover filed a brief for appellant the Great Northern Railway Company:\n The commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States does not take away from the several states the right to authorize the formation of corporations, define their business, fix the amount of their capital or purchasing power, and regulate the issue, sale, and ownership of their capital stock.\n It has been the practice, since the infancy of railroads in this country, for one railroad company to purchase or lease the railroad of a competing company, or to acquire a majority of the shares of a competing company, or of two companies competing with each other, or to effect the consolidation of competing companies. This has been done without objection from any branch of the Federal government, and has invariably proved beneficial to the railway companies concerned, to their shareholders, and to the public.\n Unity of ownership of shares of competing corporations engaged in interstate trade, does not restrain such trade, and is not forbidden by the anti-trust act, nor is such unity of ownership a regulation of interstate commerce, and thus subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction under the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n If the legislature undertakes to define a new offense by statute, and provide for its punishment, its will should be expressed in such language as not to deceive or mislead the common mind.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 197, 287]\n\u00a0\n Tozer v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200. By the decree below the United States was given substantially the relief asked by it in the bill.\n As the act is not very long, and as the determination of the particular questions arising in this case may require a consideration of the scope and meaning of most of its provisions, it is here given in full:\n' 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract, or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\n\n' 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\n\n' 3. Every contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any such territory and another, or between any such territory or territories and any state or states or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia, and any state or states or foreign nations, is hereby declared illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 319]\n\u00a0\n or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\n\n' 4. The several circuit courts of the United States are hereby invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this act; and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case; and, pending such petition, and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed just in the premises.\n\n' 5. Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any proceeding under section four of this act may be pending, that the ends of justice require that other parties should be brought before the court, the court may cause them to be summoned, whether they reside in the district in which the court is held or not; and subpoenas to that end may be served in any district by the marshal thereof.\n\n' 6. Any property owned under any contract or by any combination, or pursuant to any conspiracy (and being the subject thereof) mentioned in section one of this act, and being in the course of transportation from one state to another, or to a foreign country, shall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the forfeiture, seizure, and condemnation of property imported into the United States contrary to law.\n\n' 7. Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act may sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the dis- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 320]\n\u00a0\n trict in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n' 8. That the word 'person,' or 'persons,' wherever used in this act shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the territories, the laws of any state, or the laws of any foreign country.'\n\n Is the case as presented by the pleadings and the evidence one of a combination of a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the states, or with foreign states? Is it one in which the defendants are properly chargeable with monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of such trade or commerce? Let us see what are the facts disclosed by the record.\n The Great Northern Railway Company and the Northern Pacific Railway Company owned, controlled, and operated separate lines of railway,-the former road extending from Superior, and from Duluth and St. Paul, to Everett, Seattle, and Portland, with a branch line to Helena; the latter extending from Ashland, and from Duluth and St. Paul, to Helena, Spokane, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland. The two lines, main and branches, about 9000 miles in length, were and are parallel and competing lines across the continent through the northern tier of states between the Great Lakes and the Pacific, and the two companies were engaged in active competition for freight and passenger traffic, each road connecting at its respective terminals with lines of railway, or with lake and river steamers, or with seagoing vessels.\n Prior to 1893 the Northern Pacific system was owned or controlled and operated by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation organized under certain acts and resolutions of Congress. That company becoming insolvent, its road and property passed into the hands of receivers appointed by courts of the United States. In advance of foreclosure and \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 321]\n\u00a0\n sale a majority of its bondholders made an arrangement with the Great Northern Railway Company for a virtual consolidation of the two systems, and for giving the practical control of the Northern Pacific to the Great Northern. That was the arrangement declared in Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co. \n161 U.S. 646\n, 40 L. ed. 838, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, to be illegal under the statutes of Minnesota which forbade any railroad corporation, or the purchasers or managers of any corporation, to consolidate the stock, property, or franchises of such corporation, or to lease or purchase the works or franchises of, or in any was control, other railroad corporations owning or having under their control parallel or competing lines. Minn. Gen. Laws, 1874, chap. 29, 1881, chap. 109.\n Early in 1901 the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, having in view the ultimate placing of their two systems under a common control, united in the purchase of the capital stock of the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company, giving in payment, upon an agreed basis of exchange, the joint bonds of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, payable in twenty years from date, with interest at 4 per cent per annum. In this manner the two purchasing companies became the owners of $107,000,000 of the $112,000,000 total capital stock of the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company, whose lines aggregated about 8,000 miles, and extended from St. Paul to Chicago, and from St. Paul and Chicago to Quincy, Burlington, Des Moines, St. Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, Omaha, Lincoln, Denver, Cheyenne and Billings, where it connected with the Northern Pacific Railroad. By this purchase of stock the Great Northern and Northern Pacific acquired full control of the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy main line and branches.\n Prior to November 13th, 1901, defendant Hill and associate stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company, and defendant Morgan and associate stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, entered into a combination to form, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 322]\n\u00a0\n under the laws of New Jersey, a holding corporation, to be called the Northern Securities Company, with a capital stock of $400,000,000, and to which company, in exchange for its own capital stock upon a certain basis and at a certain rate, was to be turned over the capital stock, or a controlling interest in the capital stock, of each of the constituent railway companies, with power in the holding corporation to vote such stock and in all respects to act as the owner thereof, and to do whatever it might deem necessary in aid of such railway companies or to enhance the value of their stocks. In this manner the interests of individual stockholders in the property and franchises of the two independent and competing railway companies were to be converted into an interest in the property and franchises of the holding corporation. Thus, as stated in article 6 of the bill, 'by making the stockholders of each system jointly interested in both systems, and by practically pooling the earnings of both for the benefit of the former stockholders of each, and by vesting the selection of the directors and officers of each system in a common body, to wit, the holding corporation, with not only the power, but the duty, to pursue a policy which would promote the interests, not of one system at the expense of the other, but of both at the expense of the public, all inducement for competition between the two systems was to be removed, a virtual consolidation effected, and a monopoly of the interstate and foreign commerce formerly carried on by the two systems as independent competitors established.'\n In pursuance of this combination, and to effect its objects, the defendant, the Northern Securities Company, was organized November 13th, 1901, under the laws of New Jersey.\n Its certificate of incorporation stated that the objects for which the company was formed were: '1. To acquire by purchase, subscription, or otherwise, and to hold as investment, any bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness, or any shares of capital stock created or issued by any other corporation or corporations, association or associations, of the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 323]\n\u00a0\n state of New Jersey, or of any other state, territory, or country. 2. To purchase, hold, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise dispose of any bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness created or issued by any other corporation or corporations association or associations, of the state of New Jersey, or of any other state, territory, or country, and while owner thereof to exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges of ownership. 3. To purchase, hold, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage pledge or otherwise dispose of shares of the capital stock of any other corporation or corporations, association or associations, of the state of New Jersey, or of any other state, territory, or country, and while owner of such stock to exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges of ownership, including the right to vote thereon. 4. To aid in any manner any corporation or association of which any bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or stock are held by the corporation, and to do any acts or things designed to protect, preserve, improve, or enhance the value of any such bonds or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or stock. 5. To acquire, own, and hold such real and personal property as may be necessary or convenient for the transaction of its business.'\n It was declared in the certificate that the business or purpose of the corporation was from time to time to do any one or more of such acts and things, and that the corporation should have power to conduct its business in other states and in foreign countries, and to have one or more offices, and hold, purchase, mortgage, and convey real and personal property, out of New Jersey.\n The total authorized capital stock of the corporation was fixed at $ 400,000,000, divided into 4,000,000 shares of the par value of $100 each. The amount of the capital stock with which the corporation should commence business was fixed at $30,000. The duration of the corporation was to be perpetual.\n This charter having been obtained, Hill and his associate stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company, and \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 324]\n\u00a0\n Morgan and associate stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, assigned to the Securities Company a controlling amount of the capital stock of the respective constituent companies upon an agreed basis of exchange of the capital stock of the Securities Company for each share of the capital stock of the other companies.\n In further pursuance of the combination, the Securities Company acquired additional stock of the defendant railway companies, issuing in lieu thereof its own stock upon the above basis, and, at the time of the bringing of this suit, held, as owner and proprietor, substantially all the capital stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and, it is alleged, a controlling interest in the stock of the Great Northern Railway Company, 'and is voting the same and is collecting the dividends thereon, and in all respects is acting as the owner thereof, in the organization, management, and operation of said railway companies and in the receipt and control of their earnings.'\n No consideration whatever, the bill alleges, has existed or will exist, for the transfer of the stock of the defendant railway companies to the Northern Securities Company, other than the issue of the stock of the latter company for the purpose, after the manner, and upon the basis stated.\n The Securities Company, the bill also alleges, was not organized in good faith to purchase and pay for the stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, but solely 'to incorporate the pooling of the stocks of said companies,' and carry into effect the above combination; that it is a mere depositary, custodian, holder, or trustee of the stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies; that its shares of stock are but beneficial certificates against said railroad stocks to designate the interest of the holders in the pool; that it does not have and never had any capital to warrant such an operation; that its subscribed capital was but $30,000, and its authorized capital stock of $400,000,000 was just sufficient, when all issued, to represent \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 325]\n\u00a0\n and cover the exchange value of substantially the entire stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, upon the basis and at the rate agreed upon, which was about $122,000,000 in excess of the combined capital stock of the two railway companies taken at par; and that, unless prevented, the Securities Company would acquire, as owner and proprietor, substantially all the capital stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, issuing in lieu thereof its own capital stock to the full extent of its authorized issue, of which, upon the agreed basis of exchange, the former stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company have received or would receive and hold about 55 per cent, the balance going to the former stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company.\n The government charges that if the combination was held not to be in violation of the act of Congress, then all efforts of the national government to preserve to the people the benefits of free competition among carriers engaged in interstate commerce will be wholly unavailing, and all transcontinental lines, indeed, the entire railway systems of the country, may be absorbed, merged, and consolidated, thus placing the public at the absolute mercy of the holding corporation.\n The several defendants denied all the allegations of the bill imputing to them a purpose to evade the provisions of the act of Congress, or to form a combination or conspiracy having for its object either to restrain or to monopolize commerce or trade among the states or with foreign nations. They denied that any combination or conspiracy was formed in violation of the act.\n In our judgment, the evidence fully sustains the material allegations of the bill, and shows a violation of the act of Congress, in so far as it declares illegal every combination or conspiracy in restraint of commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, and forbids attempts to monopolize such commerce or any part of it.\n Summarizing the principal facts, it is indisputable upon this \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 326]\n\u00a0\n record that under the leadership of the defendants Hill and Morgan the stockholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway corporations, having competing and substantially parallel lines from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean at Puget sound combined and conceived the scheme of organizing a corporation under the laws of New Jersey which should hold the shares of the stock of the constituent companies; such shareholders, in lieu of their shares in those companies, to receive, upon an agreed basis of value, shares in the holding corporation; that pursuant to such combination the Northern Securities Company was organized as the holding corporation through which the scheme should be executed; and under that scheme such holding corporation has become the holder-more properly speaking, the custodian-of more than nine tenths of the stock of the Northern Pacific, and more than three fourths of the stock of the Great Northern, the stockholders of the companies who delivered their stock receiving upon the agreed basis shares of stock in the holding corporation. The stockholders of these two competing companies disappeared, as such, for the moment, but immediately reappeared as stockholders of the holding company, which was thereafter to guard the interests of both sets of stockholders as a unit, and to manage, or cause to be managed, both lines of railroad as if held in one ownership. Necessarily by this combination or arrangement the holding company in the fullest sense dominates the situation in the interest of those who were stockholders of the constituent companies; as much so, for every practical purpose, as if it had been itself a railroad corporation which had built, owned, and operated both lines for the exclusive benefit of its stockholders. Necessarily, also, the constituent companies ceased, under such a combination, to be in active competition for trade and commerce along their respective lines, and have become, practically, one powerful consolidated corporation, by the name of a holding corporation, the principal, if not the sole, object for the formation of which was to carry out the purpose of the original \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 327]\n\u00a0\n combination, under which competition between the constituent companies would cease. Those who were stockholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific and became stockholders in the holding company are now interested in preventing all competition between the two lines, and, as owners of stock or of certificates of stock in the holding company, they will see to it that no competition is tolerated. They will take care that no persons are chosen directors of the holding company who will permit competition between the constituent companies. The result of the combination is that all the earnings of the constituent companies make a common fund in the hands of the Northern Securities Company, to be distributed, not upon the basis of the earnings of the respective constituent companies, each acting exclusively in its own interests, but upon the basis of the certificates of stock issued by the holding company. No scheme or device could more certainly come within the words of the act,- 'combination in the form of a trust or otherwise . . . in restraint of commerce among the several states or with foreign nations,'-or could more effectively and certainly suppress free competition between the constituent companies. This combination is, within the meaning of the act, a 'trust;' but if not, it is a combination in restraint of interstate and international commerce; and that is enough to bring it under the condemnation of the act. The mere existence of such a combination, and the power acquired by the holding company as its trustee, constitute a menace to, and a restraint upon, that freedom of commerce which Congress intended to recognize and protect, and which the public is entitled to have protected. If such combination be not destroyed, all the advantages that would naturally come to the public under the operation of the general laws of competition, as between the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, will be lost, and the entire commerce of the immense territory in the northern part of the United States between the Great Lakes and the Pacific at Puget sound will be at the mercy of a single holding cor- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 328]\n\u00a0\n poration, organized in a state distant from the people of that territory.\n The circuit court was undoubtedly right when it said-all the judges of that court concurring-that the combination referred to 'led inevitably to the following results: First, it placed the control of the two roads in the hands of a single person, to wit, the Securities Company, by virtue of its ownership of a large majority of the stock of both companies; second, it destroys every motive for competition between two roads engaged in interstate traffic, which were natural competition for business, by pooling the earnings of the two roads for the common benefit of the stockholders of both companies.' 120 Fed. 721, 724.\n Such being the case made by the record, what are the principles that must control the decision of the present case? Do former adjudications determine the controlling questions raised by the pleadings and proofs?\n The contention of the government is that, if regard be had to former adjudications, the present case must be determined in its favor. That view is contested and the defendants insist that a decision in their favor will not be inconsistent with anything heretofore decided and would be in harmony with the act of Congress.\n Is the act to be construed as forbidding every combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the states or with foreign nations? Or, does it embrace only such restraints as are unreasonable in their nature? Is the motive with which a forbidden combination or conspiracy was formed at all material when it appears that the necessary tendency of the particular combination or conspiracy in question is to restrict or suppress free competition between competing railroads engaged in commerce among the states? Does the act of Congress prescribe, as a rule for interstate or international commerce, that the operation of the natural laws of competition between those engaged in such commerce shall not be restricted or interfered with by any contract, combination, or \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 329]\n\u00a0\n conspiracy? How far may Congress go in regulating the affairs or conduct of state corporations engaged as carriers in commerce among the states or of state corporations which, although not directly engaged themselves in such commerce, yet have control of the business of interstate carriers? If state corporations, or their stockholders, are found to be parties to a combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, which restrains interstate or international commerce, may they not be compelled to respect any rule for such commerce that may be lawfully prescribed by Congress?\n These questions were earnestly discussed at the bar by able counsel, and have received the full consideration which their importance demands.\n The first case in this court arising under the anti-trust act was United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. The next case was that of United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540. That was followed by United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 \nU.S. 505, 569\n, 571 S., 43 L. ed. 259, 287, 288, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25; Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40; Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 43 L. ed. 300, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96, and W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, ante, p. 307, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307. To these may be added Pear sall v. Great N. R. Co. \n161 U.S. 646\n, 40 L. ed. 838, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, which, although not arising under the anti-trust act, involved an agreement under which the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies should be consolidated and by which competition between those companies was to cease. In United States v. E. C. Knight Co. it was held that the agreement or arrangement there involved had reference only to the manufacture or production of sugar by those engaged in the alleged combination; but if it had directly embraced interstate or international commerce, it would then have been covered by the anti-trust act and would have been illegal; in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. that an agreement between certain railroad companies providing for establishing and maintaining, for their mutual protection, reasonable rates, rules, and regulations in respect \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 330]\n\u00a0\n of freight traffic, through and local, and by which free competition among those companies was restricted, was, by reason of such restriction, illegal under the anti-trust act; in United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. that an arrangement between certain railroad companies in reference to railroad traffic among the states, by which the railroads involved were not subjected to competition among themselves, was also forbidden by the act; in Hopkins v. United States and Anderson v. United States, that the act embraced only agreements that had direct connection with interstate commerce, and that such commerce comprehended intercourse for all the purposes of trade in any and all its forms, including the transportation, purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities between citizens of different states, and the power to regulate it embraced all the instrumentalities by which such commerce is conducted; in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, all the members of the court concurring, that the act of Congress made illegal an agreement between certain private companies or corporations engaged in different states in the manufacture, sale, and transportation of iron pipe, whereby competition among them was avoided; and in W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, all the members of the court again concurring, that a combination created by an agreement between certain private manufacturers and dealers in tiles, grates, and mantels, in different states, whereby they controlled or sought to control the price of such articles in those states, was condemned by the act of Congress. In Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co. which, as already stated, involved the consolidation of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, the court said: 'The consolidation of these two great corporations will unavoidably result in giving to the defendant [the Great Northern] a monopoly of all traffic in the northern half of the state of Minnesota, as well as of all transcontinental traffic north of the line of the Union Pacific, against which public regulations will be but a feeble protection. The acts of the Minnesota legislature of 1874 and 1881 undoubtedly \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 331]\n\u00a0\n reflected the general sentiment of the public,-that their best security is in competition.'\n We will not encumber this opinion by extended extracts from the former opinions of this court. It is sufficient to say that from the decisions in the above cases certain propositions are plainly deducible and embrace the present case. Those propositions are:\n That although the act of Congress known as the anti-trust act has no reference to the mere manufacture or production of articles or commodities within the limits of the several states, it does embrace and declare to be illegal every contract, combination, or conspiracy, in whatever form, of whatever nature, and whoever may be parties to it, which directly or necessarily operates in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations;\n That the act is not limited to restraints of interstate and international trade or commerce that are unreasonable in their nature, but embraces all direct restraints imposed by any combination, conspiracy, or monopoly upon such trade or commerce;\n That railroad carriers engaged in interstate or international trade or commerce are embraced by the act;\n That combinations, even among private manufacturers or dealers, whereby interstate or international commerce is restrained, are equally embraced by the act;\n That Congress has the power to establish rules by which interstate and international commerce shall be governed, and, by the anti-trust act, has prescribed the rule of free competition among those engaged in such commerce:\n That every combination or conspiracy which would extinguish competition between otherwise competing railroads engaged in interstate trade or commerce, and which would in that way restrain such trade or commerce, is made illegal by the act;\n That the natural effect of competition is to increase commerce, and an agreement whose direct effect is to prevent this play of competition restrains instead of promoting trade and commerce; \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 332]\n\u00a0\n That to vitiate a combination such as the act of Congress condemns, it need not be shown that the combination, in fact, results or will result, in a total suppression of trade or in a complete monopoly, but it is only essential to show that, by its necessary operation, it tends to restrain interstate or international trade or commerce or tends to create a monopoly in such trade or commerce and to deprive the public of the advantages that flow from free competition;\n That the constitutional guaranty of liberty of contract does not prevent Congress from prescribing the rule of free competition for those engaged in interstate and international commerce; and,\n That under its power to regulate commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, Congress had authority to enact the statute in question.\n No one, we assume, will deny that these propositions were distinctly announced in the former decisions of this court. They cannot be ignored or their effect avoided by the intimation that the court indulged in obiter dicta. What was said in those cases was within the limits of the issues made by the parties. In our opinion, the recognition of the principles announced in former cases must, under the conceded facts, lead to an affirmance of the decree below, unless the special objections, or some of them, which have been made to the application of the act of Congress to the present case, are of a substantial character. We will now consider those objections.\n Underlying the argument in behalf of the defendants is the idea that, as the Northern Securities Company is a state corporation, and as its acquisition of the stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies is not inconsistent with the powers conferred by its charter, the enforcement of the act of Congress, as against those corporations, will be an unauthorized interference by the national government with the internal commerce of the states creating those corporations. This suggestion does not at all impress us. There is no reason to suppose that Congress had any purpose \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 333]\n\u00a0\n to interfere with the internal affairs of the states, nor, in our opinion, is there any ground whatever for the contention that the anti-trust act regulates their domestic commerce. By its very terms the act regulates only commerce among the states and with foreign states. Viewed in that light, the act, if within the powers of Congress, must be respected; for, by the explicit words of the Constitution, that instrument and the laws enacted by Congress in pursuance of its provisions, are the supreme law of the land, 'anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,'-supreme over the states, over the courts, and even over the people of the United States,-the source of all power under our governmental system in respect of the objects for which the national government was ordained. An act of Congress constitutionally passed under its power to regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations is binding upon all; as much so as if it were embodied, in terms, in the Constitution itself. Every judicial officer, whether of a national or a state court, is under the obligations of an oath so to regard a lawful enactment of Congress. Not even a state, still less one of its artificial creatures, can stand in the way of its enforcement. If it were otherwise, the government and its laws might be prostrated at the feet of local authority. Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 385, 414, 5 L. ed. 257, 286, 293. These views have been often expressed by this court.\n It is said that whatever may be the power of a state over such subjects, Congress cannot forbid single individuals from disposing of their stock in a state corporation, even if such corporation be engaged in interstate and international commerce; that the holding or purchase by a state corporation, or the purchase by individuals, of the stock of another corporation, for whatever purpose, are matters in respect of which Congress has no authority under the Constitution; that, so far as the power of Congress is concerned, citizens, or state corporations, may dispose of their property and invest their money in any way they choose; and that in regard to all \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 334]\n\u00a0\n such matters, citizens and state corporations are subject, if to any authority, only to the lawful authority of the state in which such citizens reside or under whose laws such corporations are organized. It is unnecessary in this case to consider such abstract, general questions. The court need not now concern itself with them. They are not here to be examined and determined, and may well be left for consideration in some case necessarily involving their determination.\n In this connection, it is suggested that the contention of the government is that the acquisition and ownership of stock in a state railroad corporation is itself interstate commerce if that corporation be engaged in interstate commerce. This suggestion is made in different ways; sometimes in express words, at other times by implication. For instance, it is said that the question here is whether the power of Congress over interstate commerce extends to the regulation of the ownership of the stock in state railroad companies, by reason of their being engaged in such commerce. Again, it is said that the only issue in this case is whether the Northern Securities Company can acquire and hold stock in other state corporations. Still further, it is asked, generally, whether the organization or ownership of railroads is not under the control of the states under whose laws they came into existence? Such statements as to the issues in this case are, we think, wholly unwarranted, and are very wide of the mark; it is the setting up of mere men of straw to be easily stricken down. We do not understand that the government makes any such contentions or takes any such positions as those statements imply. It does not contend that Congress may control the mere acquisition or the mere ownership of stock in a state corporation engaged in interstate commerce. Nor does it contend that Congress can control the organization of state corporations authorized by their charters to engage in interstate and international commerce. But it does contend that Congress may protect the freedom of interstate commerce by any means that are appropriate and that are lawful, and not prohibited \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 335]\n\u00a0\n by the Constitution. It does contend that no state corporation can stand in the way of the enforcement of the national will, legally expressed. What the government particularly complains of-indeed, all that it complains of here-is the existence of a combination among the stockholders of competing railroad companies which, in violation of the act of Congress, restrains interstate and international commerce through the agency of a common corporate trustee, designated to act for both companies in repressing free competition between them. Independently of any question of the mere ownership of stock or of the organization of a state corporation, can it in reason be said that such a combination is not embraced by the very terms of the anti-trust act? May not Congress declare that combination to be illegal? If Congress legislates for the protection of the public, may it not proceed on the ground that wrongs, when effected by a powerful combination, are more dangerous and require more stringent supervision than when they are to be effected by a single person? Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 556\n, 32 S. L. ed. 223, 228, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301. How far may the courts go in order to give effect to the act of Congress, and remedy the evils it was designed by that act to suppress? These are confessedly questions of great moment, and they will now be considered.\n By the express words of the Constitution, Congress has power to 'regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.' In view of the numerous decisions of this court there ought not, at this day, to be any doubt as to the general scope of such power. In some circumstances regulation may properly take the form and have the effect of prohibition. Re Rahrer, \n140 U.S. 545\n, 35 L. ed. 572, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865; Lottery Case, \n188 U.S. 321\n, 355 47 L. ed. 492, 500, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321 and authorities there cited. Again and again this court has reaffirmed the doctrine announced in the great judgment rendered by Chief Justice Marshall for the court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196, 197, 6 L. ed. 23, 70, that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations is the power 'to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed;' that such power 'is complete \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 336]\n\u00a0\n in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution;' that 'if, as has always been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations and among the several states is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government having in its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in the Constitution of the United States;' that a sound construction of the Constitution allows to Congress a large discretion 'with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people;' and that if the end to be accomplished is within the scope of the Constitution, 'all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, are constitutional.' Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 6 L. ed. 678; Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 238, 16 L. ed. 243, 246; Henderson v. Wickham, \n92 U.S. 259\n, 23 L. ed. 543; Hannibal & St. J. R. C. o. v. Husen, \n95 \nU.S. 465, 472\n, 24 S. L. ed. 527, 530; Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 238; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 626\n, 42 S. L. ed. 878, 882, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488; Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 348\n, 47 S. L. ed. 492, 498, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321. In Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 413, 5 L. ed. 257, 293, this court said that the United States were, for many important purposes, 'a single nation,' and that 'in all commercial regulations we are one and the same people;' and it has since frequently declared that commerce among the several states was a unit, and subject to national control. Previously, in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, 4 L. ed. 579, 601, the court had said that the government ordained and established by the Constitution was, within the limits of the powers granted to it, 'the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all,' and was 'supreme within its sphere of action.' As late as the case of Re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 582\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1092, 1101, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900, 905, this court, every member of it concurring, said: 'The entire strength of the nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 337]\n\u00a0\n full and free exercise of all national powers and the security of all rights intrusted by the Constitution to its care. The strong arm of the national government may be put forth to brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate commerce or the transportation of the mails. If the emergency arises, the army of the nation, and all its militia, are at the service of the nation to compel obedience to its laws.'\n The means employed in respect of the combinations forbidden by the anti-trust act, and which Congress deemed germane to the end to be accomplished, was to prescribe as a rule for interstate and international commerce (not for domestic commerce) that it should not be vexed by combinations, conspiracies, or monopolies which restrain commerce by destroying or restricting competition. We say that Congress has prescribed such a rule, because, in all the prior cases in this court, the anti-trust act has been construed as forbidding any combination which, by its necessary operation, destroys or restricts free competition among those engaged in interstate commerce; in other words, that to destroy or restrict free competition in interstate commerce was to restrain such commerce. Now, can this court say that such a rule is prohibited by the Constitution or is not one that Congress could appropriately prescribe when exerting its power under the commerce clause of the Constitution? Whether the free operation of the normal laws of competition is a wise and wholesome rule for trade and commerce is an exonomic question which this court need not consider or determine. Undoubtedly, there are those who think that the general business interests and prosperity of the country will be best promoted if the rule of competition is not applied. But there are others who believe that such a rule is more necessary in these days of enormous wealth than it ever was in any former period of our history. Be all this as it may, Congress has, in effect, recognized the rule of free competition by declaring illegal every comoination or conspiracy in restraint of incerstate and international commerce. As, in the judgment of Congress, the public convenience and the general welfare \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 338]\n\u00a0\n will be best subserved when the natural laws of competition are left undisturbed by those engaged in interstate commerce, and as Congress has embodied that rule in a statute, that must be, for all, the end of the matter, if this is to remain a government of laws, and not of men.\n It is said that railroad corporations created under the laws of a state can only be consolidated with the authority of the state. Why that suggestion is made in this case we cannot understand, for there is no pretense that the combination here in question was under the authority of the states under whose laws these railroad corporations were created. But even if the state allowed consolidation, it would not follow that the stockholders of two or more state railroad corporations, having competing lines and engaged in interstate commerce, could lawfully combine and form a distinct corporation to hold the stock of the constituent corporations, and, by destroying competition between them, in violation of the act of Congress, restrain commerce among the states and with foreign nations.\n The rule of competition, prescribed by Congress, was not at all new in trade and commerce. And we cannot be in any doubt as to the reason that moved Congress to the incorporation of that rule into a statute. That reason was thus stated in United States v. Joint Traffic Asso.: 'Has not Congress, with regard to interstate commerce, and in the course of regulating it, in the case of railroad corporations, the power to say that no contract or combination shall be legal which shall restrain trade and commerce by shutting out the operation of the general law of competition? We think it has. . . . It is the combination of these large and powerful corporations, covering vast sections of territory and influencing trade throughout the whole extent thereof, and acting as one body in all the matters over which the combination extends, that constitutes the alleged evil, and in regard to which, so far as the combination operates upon and restrains interstate commerce, Congress has power to legislate and to prohabit.' pp. 569, 571, L. ed. pp. 287, 288 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 32. That such a rule was applied to interstate commerce \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 339]\n\u00a0\n should not have surprised anyone. Indeed, when Congress declared contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce to be illegal, it did nothing more than apply to interstate commerce a rule that had been long applied by the several states when dealing with combinations that were in restraint of their domestic commerce. The decisions in state courts upon this general subject are not only numerous and instructive, but they show the circumstances under which the anti-trust act was passed. It may well be assumed that Congress, when enacting that statute, shared the general apprehension that a few powerful corporations or combinations sought to obtain, and, unless restrained, would obtain, such absolute control of the entire trade and commerce of the country as would be detrimental to the general welfare.\n In Morris Run Coal Co. v. Barclay Coal Co. 68 Pa. 173, 186, the supreme court of Pennsylvania dealt with a combination of coal companies seeking the control, within a large territory, of the entire market for bituminous coal. The court, observing that the combination was wide in its scope, general in its influence, and injurious in its effects, said: 'When competition is left free, individual error or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of others. But here is a combination of all the companies operating in the Blossburg and Barclay mining regions, and controlling their entire productions. They have combined together to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from Pennsylvania to the Lakes. This combination has a power in its confederated form which no individual action can confer. The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left no competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the supply of coal is suspended the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices must rise. Or if the supply goes forward, the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The domestic hearth, the furnaces of the iron master, and the fires of the manufacturer all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 340]\n\u00a0\n paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article of such prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates the entire mass of the community, and leaves few of its members untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is more than a contract; it is an offense. . . . In all such combinations where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the offense is the conspiracy. Men can often do by the combination of many what, severally, no one could accomplish, and even what, when done by one, would be innocent. . . . There is a potency in numbers when combined which the law cannot overlook, where injury is the consequence.' The same principles were applied in Arnot v. Pittston & E. Coal Co. 68 N. Y. 558, 565, 23 Am. Rep. 190, 194, which was the case of a combination of two coal companies in order to give one of them a monopoly of coal in a particular region, the court of appeals of New York holding that 'a combination to effect such a purpose is inimical to the interests of the public, and that all contracts designed to effect such an end are contrary to public policy, and therefore illegal.' They were also applied by the supreme court of Ohio in Central Ohio Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Ohio St. 666, 672, which was the case of a combination among manufacturers of salt in a large salt- producing territory, the court saying: 'It is no answer to say that competition in the salt trade was not in fact destroyed, or that the price of the commodity was not unreasonably advanced. Courts will not stop to inquire as to the degree of injury inflicted upon the public; it is enough to know that the inevitable tendency of such contracts is injurious to the public.'\n So, in Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Ill. 346, 350, 22 Am. Rep. 171, 174, which was the case of a combination among grain dealers by which competition was stifled, the court saying: 'So long as competition was free, the interest of the public was safe. The laws of trade, in connection with the rigor of competition, was all the guaranty the public required; but the secret combination created by the contract destroyed all competition, and created a monopoly \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 341]\n\u00a0\n against which the public interest had no protection.' Again, in People ex rel. Peabody v. Chicago Gas Trust Co. 130 Ill. 269, 297, 8 L. R. A. 497, 506, 22 N. E. 798, 804, which involved the validity of the organization of a gas corporation which obtained a monopoly in the business of furnishing illuminating gas in the city of Chicago by buying the stock of four other gas companies, it was said: 'Of what avail is it that any number of gas companies, may be formed under the general incorporation law, if a giant trust company can be clothed with the power of buying up and holding the stock and property of such companies, and, through the control thereby attained, can direct all their operations and weld them into one huge combination?' To the same effect are cases almost too numerous to be cited. But among them we refer to Richardson v. Buhl, 77 Mich. 632, 6 L. R. A. 457, 43 N. W. 1102, which was the case of the organization of a corporation in Connecticut to unite in one corporation all the match manufacturers in the United States, and thus to obtain control of the busines of manufacturing matches; Santa Clara Valley Mill & Lumber Co. v. Hayes, 76 Cal. 387, 390, 18 Pac. 391, which was the case of a combination among manufacturers of lumber, by which it could control the business in certain localities; and India Bagging Asso. v. Kock, 14 La. Ann. 164, which was the case of a combination among vaious commercial firms to control the prices of bagging used by cotton planters.\n The cases just cited, it is true, relate to the domestic commerce of the states. But they serve to show the authority which the states possess to guard the public against combinations that repress individual enterprise and interfere with the operation of the natural laws of competition among those engaged in trade within its limits. They serve also to give point to the declaration of this court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 197, 6 L. ed. 70,-a principle never modified by any subsequent decision,-that, subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution upon the exercise of the powers granted by that instrument, 'the power over commerce with foreign nations and among the several states is vested in Congress as absolutely \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 342]\n\u00a0\n as it would be in a single government having in its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in the Constitution of the United States.' Is there, then any escape from the conclusion that, subject only to such restrictions, the power of Congress over interstate and international commerce is as full and complete as is the power of any state over its domestic commerce? If a state may strike down combinations that restrain its domestic commerce by destroying free competition among those engaged in such commerce, what power, except that of Congress, is competent to protect the freedom of interstate and international commerce when assailed by a combination that restrains such commerce by stifling competition among those engaged in it?\n Now, the court is asked to adjudge that, if held to embrace the case before us, the anti-trust act is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. In this view we are unable to concur. The contention of the defendants could not be sustained without, in effect, overruling the prior decisions of this court as to the scope and validity of the anti-trust act. If, as the court has held, Congress can strike down a combination between private persons or private corporations that restrains trade among the states in iron pipe (as in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States) or in tiles, grates, and mantels (as in W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry), surely it ought not to be doubted that Congress has power to declare illegal a combination that restrains commerce among the states, and with foreign nations, as carried on over the lines of competing railroad companies exercising public franchises, and engaged in such commerce. We cannot agree that Congress may strike down combinations among manufacturers and dealers in iron pipe, tiles, grates, and mantels that restrain commerce among the states in such articles, but may not strike down combinations among stockholders of competing railroad carriers, which restrain commerce as involved in the transportation of passengers and property among the several states. If private parties may not, by combination among themselves, restrain interstate \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 343]\n\u00a0\n and international commerce in violation of an act of Congress, much less can such restraint be tolerated when imposed or attempted to be imposed, upon commerce as carried on over public highways. Indeed, if the contentions of the defendants are sound, why may not all the railway companies in the United States, that are engaged, under state charters, in interstate and international commerce, enter into a combination such as the one here in question, and, by the device of a holding corporation, obtain the absolute control throughout the entire country of rates for passengers and freight, beyond the power of Congress to protect the public against their exactions? The argument in behalf of the defendants necessarily leads to such results, and places Congress, although invested by the people of the United States with full authority to regulate interstate and international commerce, in a condition of utter helplessness, so far as the protection of the public against such combinations is concerned.\n Will it be said that Congress can meet such emergencies by prescribing the rates by which interstate carriers shall be governed in the transportation of freight and passengers? If Congress has the power to fix such rates-and upon that question we express no opinion-it does not choose to exercise its power in that way or to that extent. It has, all will agree, a large discretion as to the means to be employed in the exercise of any power granted to it. For the present, it has determined to go no farther than to protect the freedom of commerce among the states and with foreign states by declaring illegal all contracts, combinations, conspiracies, or monopolies in restraint of such commerce, and make it a public offense to violate the rule thus prescribed. How much further it may go, we do not now say. We need only at this time consider whether it has exceeded its powers in enacting the statute here in question.\n Assuming, without further discussion, that the case before us is within the terms of the act, and that the act is not in excess of the powers of Congress, we recur to the question, How far may the courts go in reaching and suppressing the combination \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 344]\n\u00a0\n described in the bill? All will agree that if the anti-trust act be constitutional, and if the combination in question be in violation of its provisions, the courts may enforce the provisions of the statute by such orders and decrees as are necessary or appropriate to that end and as may be consistent with the fundamental rules of legal procedure. And all, we take it, will agree, as established firmly by the decisions of this court, that the power of Congress over commerce extends to all the instrumentalities of such commerce, and to every device that many be employed to interfere with the freedom of commerce among the states and with foreign nations. Equally, we assume, all will agree that the Constitution and the legal enactments of Congress are, by express words of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution and laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Nevertheless, the defendants, strangely enough, invoke in their behalf the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which declares that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people;' and we are confronted with the suggestion that any order or decree of the Federal court which will prevent the Northern Securities Company from exercising the power it acquired in becoming the holder of the stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies will be an invasion defeat the act of Congress. Upon like the Securities Company was chartered, as well as of the rights of the states creating the other companies. In other words, if the state of New Jersey gives a charter to a corporation, and even if the obtaining of such charter is in fact pursuant to a combination under which it becomes the holder of the stocks of shareholders in two competing, commerce. All this can be done without infringing in any degree upon the just competition between the respective roads of those companies is to be destroyed and the enormous commerce carried on over them restrained by suppressing competition, Congress must stay its hands and allow \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 345]\n\u00a0\n such restraint to continue, to the detriment of the public, because, forsooth, the corporations concerned or some of them are state corporations. We cannot conceive how it is possible for anyone to seriously contend for such a proposition. It means nothing less than that Congress, in regulating interstate commerce, must act in subordination to the will of the states when exerting their power to create corporations. No such view can be entertained for a moment.\n It is proper to say in passing that nothing in the record tends to show that the state of New Jersey had any reason to suspect that those who took advantage of its liberal incorporation laws had in view, when organizing the Securities Company, to destroy competition between two great railway carriers engaged in interstate commerce in distant states of the Union. The purpose of the combination was concealed under very general words that gave no clue whatever to the real purposes of those who brought about the organization of the Securities Company. If the certificate of incorporation of that company had expressly stated that the object of the company was to destroy competition between competing, parallel lines of interstate carriers, all would have seen, at the outset, that the scheme was in hostility to the national authority, and that there was a purpose to violate or evade the act of Congress.\n We reject any such view of the relations of the national government and the states composing the Union as that for which the defendants contend. Such a view cannot be maintained without destroying the just authority of the United States. It is inconsistent with all the decisions of this court as to the powers of the national government over matters committed to it. No state can, by merely creating a corporation, or in any other mode, project its authority into other states, and across the continent, so as to prevent Congress from exerting the power it possesses under the Constitution over interstate and international commerce, or so as to exempt its corporation engaged in interstate commerce from obedience to any rule lawfully established by Congress for such com- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 346]\n\u00a0\n merce. It cannot be said that any state may give a corporation, created under its laws, authority to restrain interstate or international commerce against the will of the nation as lawfully expressed by Congress. Every corporation created by a state is necessarily subject to the supreme law of the land. And yet the suggestion is made that to restrain a state corporation from interfering with the free course of trade and commerce among the states, in violation of an act of Congress, is hostile to the reserved rights of the states. The Federal court may not have power to forfeit the charter of the Securities Company; it may not declare how its shares of stock may be transferred on its books, nor prohibit it from acquiring real estate, nor diminish or increase, its capital stock. All these and like matters are to be regulated by the state which created the company. But to the end that effect be given to the national will, lawfully expressed, Congress may prevent that company, in its capacity as a holding corporation and trustee, from carrying out the purposes of a combination formed in restraint of interstate commerce. The Securities Company is itself a part of the present combination; its head and front; its trustee. It would be extraordinary if the court, in executing the act of Congress, could not lay hands upon that company and prevent it from doing that which, if done, will defeat the act of Congress. Upon like grounds the court can, by appropriate orders, prevent the two competing railroad companies here involved from co-operating with the Securities Company in restraining commerce among the states. In short, the court may make any order necessary to bring about the dissolution or suppression of an illegal combination that restrains interstate commerce. All this can be done without infringing in any degree upon the just authority of the states. The affirmance of the judgment below will only mean that no combination, however powerful, is stronger than the law, or will be permitted to avail itself of the pretext that to prevent it doing that which, if done, would defeat a legal enactment of Congress, is to attack the reserved rights of the states. It \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 347]\n\u00a0\n would mean that the government which represents all, can, when acting within the limits of its powers, compel obedience to its authority. It would mean that no device in evasion of its provisions, however skilfully such device may have been contrived, and no combination, by whomsoever formed, is beyond the reach of the supreme law of the land, if such device or combination, by its operation, directly restrains commerce among the states or with foreign nations in violation of the act of Congress.\n The defendants rely, with some confidence, upon the case of the Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, 473, 22 L. ed. 678, 684. But nothing we have said is inconsistent with any principle announced in that case. The court there recognized the principle that a state has plenary powers 'over its own territory, its highways, its franchises, and its corporations,' and observed that 'we are bound to sustain the constitutional powers and prerogatives of the states, as well as those of the United States, whenever they are brought before us for adjudication, no matter what may be the consequences.' Of course, every state has, in a general sense, plenary power over its corporations. But is it conceivable that a state, when exerting power over a corporation of its creation, may prevent or embarrass the exercise by Congress of any power with which it is invested by the Constitution? In the case just referred to the court does not say, and it is not to be supposed that it will ever say, that any power exists in a state to prevent the enforcement of a lawful enactment of Congress, or to invest any of its corporations, in whatever business engaged, with authority to disregard such enactment or defeat its legitimate operation. On the contrary, the court has steadily held to the doctrine, vital to the United States as well as to the states, that a state enactment, even if passed in the exercise of its acknowledged powers, must yield, in case of conflict, to the supremacy of the Constitution of the United States and the acts of Congress enacted in pursuance of its provisions. This results, the court has said, as well from the nature of the gov- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 348]\n\u00a0\n ernment as from the words of the Constitution. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210, 6 L. ed. 23, 73; Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243, 16 L. ed. 243, 247; Re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 39 L. ed. 1092, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900; Missouri, K. &. T. R. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 626\n, 627 S., 42 L. ed. 878, 883, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488. In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725, 19 L. ed. 227, 237, the court remarked 'that 'the people of each state compose a state, having its own government, and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence,' and that 'without the states in union, there could be no such political body as the United States.' Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 76, 19 L. ed. 104. Not only, therefore, can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the states, through their union under the Constitution, but it may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the states, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the national government.' These doctrines are at the basis of our constitutional government, and cannot be disregarded with safety.\n The defendants also rely on Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n161 \nU.S. 677, 702\n, 40 S. L. ed. 849, 859, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714, 724, In that case it was contended by the railroad company that the assumption of the state to forbid the consolidation of parallel and competing lines was an interference with the power of Congress over interstate commerce. The court observed that but little need be said in answer to such a proposition, for 'it has never been supposed that the dominant power of Congress over interstate commerce took from the states the power of legislation with respect to the instruments of such commerce, so far as the legislation was within its ordinary police powers.' But that case distinctly recognized that there was a division of power between Congress and the states in respect to interstate railways, and that Congress had the superior right to control that commerce and forbid interference therewith, while to the states remained the power to create and to regulate the instruments of such commerce, so far as necessary to the conservation of the public interests. If there is anything in that case which \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 349]\n\u00a0\n even intimates that a state or a state corporation may in any way directly restrain interstate commerce, over which Congress has, by the Constitution, complete control, we have been unable to find it.\n The question of the relations of the general government with the states is again presented by the specific contention of each defendant that Congress did not intend 'to limit the power of the several states to create corporations, define their purposes, fix the amount of their capital, and determine who may buy, own, and sell their stock.' All that is true, generally speaking, but the contention falls far short of meeting the controlling questions in this case. To meet this contention we must repeat some things already said in this opinion. But if what we have said be sound, repetition will do no harm. So far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, a state may, indeed, create a corporation, define its powers, prescribe the amount of its stock and the mode in which it may be transferred. It may even authorize one of its corporations to engage in commerce of every kind,-domestic, interstate, and international. The regulation or control of purely domestic commerce of a state is, of course, with the state, and Congress has no direct power over it so long as what is done by the state does not interfere with the operations of the general government, or any legal enactment of Congress. A state, if it chooses so to do, may even submit to the existence of combinations within its limits that restrain its internal trade. But neither a state corporation nor its stockholders can, by reason of the nonaction of the state or by means of any combination among such stockholders, interfere with the complete enforcement of any rule lawfully devised by Congress for the conduct of commerce among the states or with foreign nations; for, as we have seen, interstate and international commerce is, by the Constitution, under the control of Congress, and it belongs to the legislative department of the government to prescribe rules for the conduct of that commerce. If it were otherwise, the declaration in the Constitu- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 350]\n\u00a0\n tion of its supremacy, and of the supremacy as well of the laws made in pursuance of its provisions, was a waste of words. Whilst every instrumentality of domestic commerce is subject to state control, every instrumentality of interstate commerce may be reached and controlled by national authority, so far as to compel it to respect thc rules for such commerce lawfully established by Congress. No corporate person can excuse a departure from or violation of that rule under the plea that that which it has done or omitted to do is permitted, or not forbidden, by the state under whose authority it came into existence. We repeat that no state can endow any of its corporations, or any combination of its citizens, with authority to restrain interstate or international commerce, or to disobey the national will as manifested in legal enactments of Congress. So long as Congress keeps within the limits of its authority as defined by the Constitution, infringing no rights recognized or secured by that instrument, its regulations of interstate and international commerce, whether founded in wisdom or not, must be submitted to by all. Harm, and only harm, can come from the failure of the courts to recognize this fundamental principle of constitutional construction. To depart from it because of the circumstances of special cases, or because the rule, in its operation, may possibly affect the interests of business, is to endanger the safety and integrity of our institutions and make the Constitution mean not what it says, but what interested parties wish it to mean at a particular time and under particular circumstances. The supremacy of the law is the foundation rock upon which our institutions rest. The law, this court said in United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 220\n, 27 S. L. ed. 171, 181, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, is the only supreme power in our system of government. And no higher duty rests upon this court than to enforce, by its decrees, the will of the legislative department of the government, as expressed in a statute, unless such statute be plainly and unmistakably in violation of the Constitution. If the statute is beyond the constitutional power of Congress, the court would fail in the performance of a solemn duty if it \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 351]\n\u00a0\n did not so declare. But if nothing more can be said than that Congress has erred,-and the court must not be understood as saying that is has or has not erred,-the remedy for the error and the attendant mischief is the selection of new senators and representatives, who, by legislation, will make such changes in existing statutes, or adopt such new statutes, as may be demanded by their constituents and be consistent with law.\n Many suggestions were made in argument based upon the thought that the anti-trust act would, in the end, prove to be mischievous in its consequences. Disaster to business and wide-spread financial ruin, it has been intimated, will follow the execution of its provisions. Such predictions were made in all the cases heretofore arising under that act. But they have not been verified. It is the history of monopolies in this country and in England that predictions of ruin are habitually made by them when it is attempted, by legislation, to restrain their operations and to protect the public against their exactions. In this, as in former cases, they seek shelter behind the reserved rights of the states and even behind the constitutional guaranty of liberty of contract. But this court has heretofore adjudged that the act of Congress did not touch the rights of the states, and that liberty of contract did not involve a right to deprive the public of the advantages of free competition in trade and commerce. Liberty of contract does not imply liberth in a corporation or individuals to defy the national will, when legally expressed. Nor does the enforcement of a legal enactment of Congress infringe, in any proper sense, the general inherent right of every one to acquire and hold property. That right, like all other rights, must be exercised in subordination to the law.\n But even if the court shared the gloomy forebodings in which the defendants indulge, it could not refuse to respect the action of the legislative branch of the government if what it has done is within the limits of its constitutional power. The suggestions of disaster to business have, we apprehend, their origin \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 352]\n\u00a0\n in the zeal of parties who are opposed to the policy underlying the act of Congress or are interested in the result of this particular case; at any rate, the suggestions imply that the court may and ought to refuse the enforcement of the provisions of the act if, in its judgment, Congress was not wise in prescribing as a rule by which the conduct of interstate and international commerce is to be governed, that every combination, whatever its form, in restraint of such commerce and the monopolizing or attempting to monopolize such commerce, shall be illegal. These, plainly, are questions as to the policy of legislation which belong to another department, and this court has no function to supervise such legislation from the standpoint of wisdom or policy. We need only say that Congress has authority to declare, and by the language of its act, as interpreted in prior cases, has, in effect, declared, that the freedom of interstate and international commerce shall not be obstructed or disturbed by any combination, conspiracy, or monopoly that will restrain such commerce, by preventing the free operation of competition among interstate carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight. This court cannot disregard that declaration unless Congress, in passing the statute in question, be held to have transgressed the limits prescribed for its action by the Constitution. But, as already indicated, it cannot be so held consistently with the provisions of that instrument.\n The combination here in question may have been for the pecuniary benefit of those who formed or caused it to be formed. But the interests of private persons and corporations cannot be made paramount to the interests of the general public. Under the Articles of Confederation commerce among the original states was subject to vexatious and local regulations that took no account of the general welfare. But it was for the protection of the general interests, as involved in interstate and international commerce, that Congress, representing the whole country, was given by the Constitution full power to regulate commerce among the states and with foreign \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 353]\n\u00a0\n nations. In Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446, 6 L. ed. 678, 688, it was said: 'Those who felt the injury arising from this state of things, and those who were capable of estimating the influence of commerce on the prosperity of nations, perceived the necessity of giving the control over this important subject to a single government. It may be doubted whether any of the evils proceeding from the feebleness of the Federal government contributed more to that great revolution which introduced the present system than the deep and general conviction that commerce ought to be regulated by Congress.' Railroad companies, we said in the Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. Case, 'are instruments of commerce, and their business is commerce itself.' And such companies, it must be remembered, operate 'public highways, established primarily for the convenience of the people, and therefore are subject to governmental control and regulation.' Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 \nU.S. 641, 657\n, 34 S. L. ed. 295, 302, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965; Chicago, St. L. & N. O. R. Co. v. Pullman Southern Car Co. \n139 \nU.S. 79, 90\n, 35 S. L. ed. 97, 102, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 475\n, 38 S. L. ed. 1047, 1056, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 545, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1125; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 \nU.S. 290, 332\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1007, 1024, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 544\n, 42 S. L. ed. 819, 848, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418; Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 \nU.S. 285, 301\n, 43 S. L. ed. 702, 708, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465. When such carriers, in the exercise of public franchises, engage in the transportation of passengers and freight among the states, they become-even if they be state corporations-subject to such rules as Congress may lawfully establish for the conduct of interstate commerce.\n It was said in argument that the circumstances under which the Northern Securities Company obtained the stock of the constituent companies imported simply an investment in the stock of other corporations,- a purchase of that stock; which investment or purchase, it is contended, was not forbidden by the charter of the company, and could not be made illegal by any act of Congress. This view is wholly fallacious, and does not comport with the actual transaction. There was no actual investment, in any substantial sense, by the Northern Securities Company in the stock of the two constituent \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 354]\n\u00a0\n COMPANIES. IF IT WAS, IN FORM, SUCH A Transaction, it Was not, in fact, one of that kind. However that company may have acquired for itself any stock in the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, no matter how it obtained the means to do so, all the stock it held or acquired in the constituent companies was acquired and held to be used in suppressing competition between those companies. It came into existence only for that purpose. If anyone had full knowledge of what was designed to be accomplished, and as to what was actually accomplished, by the combination in question, it was the defendant Morgan. In his testimony he was asked, 'Why put the stocks of both these [constituent companies] into one holding company?' He frankly answered: 'In the first place, this holding company was simply a question of custodian, because it had no other alliances.' That disclosed the actual nature of the transaction, which was only to organize the Northern Securities Company as a holding company, in whose hands, not as a real purchaser or absolute owner, but simply as custodian, were to be placed the stocks of the constituent companies,-such custodian to represent the combination formed between the shareholders of the constituent companies, the direct and necessary effect of such combination being, as already indicated, to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce by suppressing, or (to use the words of this court in United States v. Joint Traffic Asso.) 'smothering' competition between the lines of two railway carriers.\n We will now inquire as to the nature and extent of the relief granted to the government by the decree below.\n By the decree in the circuit court it was found and adjudged that the defendants had entered into a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, such as the act of Congress denounced as illegal; and that all of the stocks of the Northern Pacific Railway Company and all the stock of the Great Northern Railway Company, claimed to be owned and held by the Northern Securities Company, was acquired, and is by it held, in virtue of such com- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 355]\n\u00a0\n bination or conspiracy, in restraint of trade and commerce among the several states. It was therefore decreed as follows: 'That the Northern Securities Company, its officers, agents, servants, and employees, be and they are hereby enjoined from acquiring, or attempting to acquire, further stock of either of the aforesaid railway companies; that the Northern Securities Company be enjoined from voting the aforesaid stock which it now holds or may acquire, and from attempting to vote it, at any meeting of the stockholders of either of the aforesaid railway companies, and from exercising or attempting to exercise any control, direction, supervision, or influence whatsoever over the acts and doings of said railway companies, or either of them, by virtue of its holding such stock therein; that the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company, their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be and they are hereby respectively and collectively enjoined from permitting the stock aforesaid to be voted by the Northern Securities Company, or in its behalf, by its attorneys or agents, at any corporate election for directors or officers of either of the aforesaid railway companies; that they, together with their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be likewise enjoined and respectively restrained from paying any dividends to the Northern Securities Company on account of stock in either of the aforesaid railway companies, which it now claims to own and hold; and that the aforesaid railway companies, their officers, directors, servants, and agents, be enjoined from permitting or suffering the Northern Securities Company or any of its officers or agents, as such officers or agents, to exercise any control whatsoever over the corporate acts of either of the aforesaid railway companies. But nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securities Company from returning and transferring to the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company, respectively, any and all shares of stock in either of said railway companies which said The Northern Securities Company may have heretofore received from such stock- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 356]\n\u00a0\n holders in exchange for its own stock; and nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Northern Securities Company from making such transfer and assignments of the stock aforesaid to such person or persons as may now be the holders and owners of its own stock originally issued in exchange or in payment for the stock claimed to have been acquired by it in the aforesaid railway companies.'\n Subsequently, and before the appeal to this court was perfected, an order was made in the circuit court to this effect: 'That upon the giving of an approved bond to the United States by or on behalf of the defendants in the sum of $50,000, conditioned to prosecute their appeal with effect and to pay all damages which may result to the United States from this order, that portion of the injunction contained in the final decree herein which forbids the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company, their officers, directors, servants, and agents, from paying dividends to the Northern Securities Company on account of stock in either of the railway companies which the Securities Company claims to own and hold, is suspended during the pendency of the appeal allowed herein this day. All other portions of the decree and of the injunction it contains remain in force and are unaffected by this order.'\n No valid objection can be made to the decree below, in form or in substance. If there was a combination or conspiracy in violation of the act of Congress, between the stockholders of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railway Companies, whereby the Northern Securities Company was formed as a holding corporation, and whereby interstate commerce over the lines of the constituent companies was restrained, it must follow that the court, in execution of that act, and to defeat the efforts to evade it, could prohibit the parties to the combination from doing the specific things which, being done, would affect the result denounced by the act. To say that the court could not go so far is to say that it is powerless to enforce the act or to suppress the illegal combination, and powerless \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 357]\n\u00a0\n to protect the rights of the public as against that combination.\n It is here suggested that the alleged combination had accomplished its object before the commencement of this suit, in that the Securities Company had then organized, and had actually received a majority of the stock of the two constituent companies; therefore, it is argued, no effective relief can now be granted to the government. This same view was pressed upon the circuit court and was rejected. It was completely answered by that court when it said: 'Concerning the second contention, we observe that it would be a novel, not to say absurd, interpretation of the anti-trust act to hold that after an unlawful combination is formed and has acquired the power which it had no right to acquire,-namely, to restrain commerce by suppressing competition,-and is proceeding to use it and execute the purpose for which the combination was formed, it must be left in possession of the power that it has acquired, with full freedom to exercise it. Obviously, the act, when fairly interpreted, will bear no such construction. Congress aimed to destroy the power to place any direct restraint on interstate trade or commerce, when, by any combination or conspiracy, formed by either natural or artificial persons, such a power had been acquired; and the government may intervene and demand relief as well after the combination is fully organized as while it is in process of formation. In this instance, as we have already said, the Securities Company made itself a party to a combination in restraint of interstate commerce that antedated its organization, as soon as it came into existence; doing so, of course, under the direction of the very individuals who promoted it.' The circuit court has done only what the actual situation demanded. Its decree has done nothing more than to meet the requirements of the statute. It could not have done less without declaring its impotency in dealing with those who have violated the law. The decree, if executed, will destroy not the property interests of the original stockholders of the constituent companies, but \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 358]\n\u00a0\n the power of the holding corporation as the instrument of an illegal combination of which it was the master spirit, to do that which, if done, would restrain interstate and international commerce. The exercise of that power being restrained, the object of Congress will be accomplished; left undisturbed, the act in question will be valueless for any practical purpose.\n It is said that this statute contains criminal provisions and must therefore be strictly construed. The rule upon that subject is a very ancient and salutary one. It means only that we must not bring cases within the provisions of such a statute that are not clearly embraced it, nor by narrow, technical, or forced construction of words, exclude cases from it that are obviously within its provisions. What must be sought for always is the intention of the legislature, and the duty of the court is to give effect to that intention as disclosed by the words used.\n As early as the case of King v. Hodnett, 1 T. R. 96, 101, Mr. Justice Buller said: 'It is not true that the courts, in the exposition of penal statutes, are to narrow the construction.' In United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat, 76, 95, 5 L. ed. 37, 42, Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the judgment of this court and referring to the rule that penal statutes are to be construed strictly, said: 'It is a modification of the ancient maxim, and amounts to this; that though penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases which those words, in their ordinary acceptation, or in that sense in which the legislature has obviously used them, would comprehend. The intention of the legislature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for construction.' In United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475, 10 L. ed. 543, 548, this court, speaking by Chief Justice Taney, said: 'In expounding a penal statute the court certainly will not extend it beyond \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 359]\n\u00a0\n the plain meaning of its words; for it has been long and well settled that such statutes must be construed strictly. Yet the evident intention of the legislature ought not to be defeated by a forced and overstrict construction. 5 Wheat. 95, 5 L. ed. 42.' So, in The Industry, 1 Gall. 114, 117, Fed. Cas. No. 7,028, Mr. Justice Story said: 'We are undoubtedly bound to construe penal statutes strictly, and not to extend them beyond their obvious meaning by strained inferences. On the other hand, we are bound to interpret them according to the manifest import of the words, and to hold all cases which are within the words and the mischiefs to be within the remedial influence of the statute.' In another case the same eminent jurist said: 'I agree to that rule in its true and sober sense; and that is, that penal statutes are not to be enlarged by implication or extended to cases not obviously within their words and purport. . . . In short, it appears to me that the proper course in all these cases is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature, and to adopt that sense of the words which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature.' United States v. Winn, 3 Sumn. 209, 211, 212, Fed. Cas. No. 16,740. In People v. Bartow, 6 Cow. 290, the highest court of New York said: 'Although a penal statute is to be construed strictly, the court are not to disregard the plain intent of the legislature. . . . It is well settled that a statute which is made for the good of the public ought although it be penal, to receive an equitable construction.' So, in Com. v. Martin, 17 Mass. 359, 362, the highest court of Massachusetts said: 'If a statute creating or increasing a penalty be capable of two constructions, undoubtedly that construction which operates in favor of life or liberty is to be adopted; but it is not justifiable in this any more than in any other case, to imagine ambiguities merely that a lenient construction may be adopted. If such were the privilege of a court, it would be easy to obstruct the public will in almost every statute enacted; for it rarely happens that one is so precise and exact in its terms as to \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 360]\n\u00a0\n preclude the exercise of ingenuity in raising doubts about its construction.' There are cases almost without number in this country and in England to the same effect.\n Guided by these long-established rules of construction, it is manifest that if the antitrust act is held not to embrace a case such as is now before us, the plain intention of the legislative branch of the government will be defeated. If Congress has not, by the words used in the act, described this and like cases, it would, we apprehend, be impossible to find words that would describe them. This, it must be remembered, is a suit in equity, instituted by authority of Congress 'to prevent and restrain violations of the act,'  4; and the court, in virtue of a well- settled rule governing proceedings in equity, may mould its decree so as to accomplish practical results,-such results as law and justice demand. The defendants have no just cause to complain of the decree, in matter of law, and it should be affirmed.\n The judgment of the court is that the decree below be and hereby is affirmed, with liberty to the Circuit Court to proceed in the execution of its decree as the circumstances may require.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, concurring:\n I cannot assent to all that is said in the opinion just announced, and believe that the importance of the case and the questions involved justify a brief statement of my views.\n First, let me say that while I was with the majority of the court in the decision in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540, followed by the cases of United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96, and W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry (decided at the present term) \n193 U.S. 38\n, ante, 307, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307, and while a further examination (which has been induced by the able and exhaustive arguments of counsel in the present case) has not disturbed the conviction that those cases were rightly decided, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 361]\n\u00a0\n I think that in some respects the reasons given for the judgments cannot be sustained. Instead of holding that the anti-trust act included all contracts, reasonable or unreasonable, in restraint of interstate trade, the ruling should have been that the contracts there presented were unreasonable restraints of interstate trade, and as such within the scope of the act. That act, as appears from its title, was leveled at only 'unlawful restraints and monopolies.' Congress did not intend to reach and destroy those minor contracts in partial restraint of trade which the long course of decisions at common law had affirmed were reasonable and ought to be upheld. The purpose rather was to place a statutory prohibition, with prescribed penalties and remedies, upon those contracts which were in direct restraint of trade, unreasonable, and against public policy. Whenever a departure from common-law rules and definitions is claimed, the purpose to make the departure should be clearly shown. Such a purpose does not appear, and such a departure was not intended.\n Further, the general language of the act is also limited by the power which each individual has to manage his own property and determine the place and manner of its investment. Freedom of action in these respects is among the inalienable rights of every citizen. If, applying this thought to the present case, it appeared that Mr. Hill was the owner of a majority of the stock in the Great Northern Railway Company, he could not, by any act of Congress, be deprived of the right of investing his surplus means in the purchase of stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, although such purchase might tend to vest in him through that ownership a control over both companies. In other words, the right which allother citizens had, of purchasing Northern Pacific stock, could not be denied to him by Congress because of his ownership of stock in the Great Northern Company. Such was the ruling in Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co. \n161 U.S. 646\n, 40 L. ed. 838, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, in which this court said (p. 671, L. ed. p. 847, Sup. Ct. Rep. 712), in reference to the right of the stockholders of the Great Northern Company to purchase the stock of the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 362]\n\u00a0\n Northern Pacific Railway Company: 'Doubtless these stockholders could lawfully acquire, by individual purchases, a majority or even the whole of the stock of the reorganized company, and thus possibly obtain its ultimate control; but the companies would still remain separate corporations, with no interests, as such, in common.'\n But no such investment by a single individual of his means is here presented. There was a combination by several individuals, separately owning stock in two competing railroad companies, to place the control of both in a single corporation. The purpose to combine, and by combination destroy competition, existed before the organization of the corporation, the Securities Company. That corporation, though nominally having a capital stock of $400,000,000, had no means of its own; $30,000 in cash was put into its treasury, but simply for the expenses of organization. The organizers might just as well have made the nominal stock a thousand millions as four hundred, and the corporation would have been no richer or poorer. A corporation, while by fiction of law recognized for some purposes as a person, and, for purposes of jurisdiction, as a citizen, is not endowed with the inalienable rights of a natural person. It is an artificial person, created and existing only for the convenient transaction of business. In this case it was a mere instrumentality by which separate railroad properties were combined under one control. That combination is as direct a restraint of trade by destroying competition as the appointment of a committee to regulate rates. The prohibition of such a combination is not at all inconsistent with the right of an individual to purchase stock. The transfer of stock to the Securities Company was a mere incident, the manner in which the combination to destroy competition, and thus unlawfully restrain trade, was carried out.\n If the parties interested in these two railroad companies can, through the instrumentality of a holding corporation, place both under one control, then in like manner, as was conceded on the argument by one of the counsel for the appellants, could \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 363]\n\u00a0\n the control of all the railroad companies in the country be placed in a single corporation. Nor need this arrangement for control stop with what has already been done. The holders of $201,000,000 of stock in the Northern Securities Company might organize another corporation to hold their stock in that company, and the new corporation, holding the majority of the stock in the Northern Securities Company, and acting in obedience to the wishes of a majority of its stockholders, would control the action of the Securities Company and through it the action of the two railroad companies; and this process might be extended until a single corporation whose stock was owned by three or four parties would be in practical control of both roads; or, having before us the possibilities of combination, the control of the whole transportation system of the country. I cannot believe that to be a reasonable or lawful restraint of trade.\n Again, there is by this suit no interference with state control. It is a recognition rather than a disregard of its action. This merging of control and destruction of competition was not authorized, but specifically prohibited by the state which created one of the railroad companies, and within whose boundaries the lines of both were largely located and much of their business transacted. The purpose and policy of the state are therefore enforced by the decree. So far as the work of the two railroad companies was interstate commerce, it was subject to the control of Congress, and its purpose and policy were expressed in the act under which this suit was brought.\n It must also be remembered that under present conditions a single railroad is, if not a legal, largely a practical, monopoly; and the arrangement by which the control of these two competing roads was merged in a single corporation broadens and extends such monopoly. I cannot look upon it as other than an unreasonable combination in restraint of interstate commerce,-one in conflict with state law, and within the letter and spirit of the statute and the power of Congress. Therefore I concur in the judgment of affirmance. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 364]\n\u00a0\n I have felt constrained to make these observations for fear that the broad and sweeping language of the opinion of the court might tend to unsettle legitimate business enterprises, stifle or retard wholesome business activities, encourage improper disregard of reasonable contracts, and invite unnecessary litigation.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, with whom concurred the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Peckham, dissenting:\n I am unable to agree with the judgment of the majority of the court, and although I think it useless and undesirable, as a rule, to express dissent, I feel bound to do so in this case and to give my reasons for it.\n Great cases, like hard cases, make bad law. For great cases are called great, not by reason of their real importance in shaping the law of the future, but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 365]\n\u00a0\n Under these circumstances Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hill organized under the laws of New Jersey the Northern Securities Company. The purpose was that the company should become the holder of the stock of the two railroads. This was to be effected by having the Northern Securities Company give its stock in exchange for that of the two railroad companies. Whilst the purpose of the promoters was mainly to exchange the stock held by them in the two railroads for the Northern Securities Company stock, nevertheless the right of stockholders generally in the two railroads to make a similar exchange or to sell their stock to the Securities Company was provided for. Under the arrangement the Northern Securities Company came to be the registered holder of a majority of the stock of both the railroads. It is not denied that the charter and the acts done under it, of the Northern Securities Company, were authorized by the laws of New Jersey, and, therefore, in so far as those laws were competent to sanction the transaction, the corporation held the stock in the two railroads secured by the law of the state of its domicil.\n The government by its bill challenges the right of the Northern Securities Company to hold and own the stock in the two railroads. The grounds upon which the relief sought was based were, generally speaking, as follows: That, as the two railroads were competing lines engaged in part in interstate commerce, the creation of the Northern Securities Company and the acquisition by it of a majority of the stock of both roads was contrary to the act of Congress known as the anti-trust act. 26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200. The clauses of the act which it was charged were violated were the 1st section, declaring illegal 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations;' and the provisions of the 2d section, making it a misdemeanor for any person to 'monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 366]\n\u00a0\n states or with foreign nations.' The court below sustained the contentions of the government. It, therefore, enjoined the two railroad companies from allowing the Northern Securities Company to vote the stock standing in its name or to pay to that company any dividends upon the stock by it held. On the giving, however, of a bond fixed by the court below the decree relating to the payment of dividends was suspended pending the appeal to this court.\n The court recognized, however, the right of the Northern Securities Company to retransfer the stock in both railroads to the persons from whom it had been acquired. The correctness of the decree below is the question presented for decision.\n Two questions arise. Does the anti-trust act, when rightly interpreted, apply to the acquisition and ownership by the Northern Securities Company of the stock in the two railroads? and, second, If it does, had Congress the power to regulate or control such acquisition and ownership? As the question of power lies at the root of the case, I come at once to consider that subject. Before doing so, however, in order to avoid being misled by false or irrelevant issues, it is essential to briefly consider two questions of fact. It is said, first, that the mere exchange by the Northern Securities Company of its stock for stock in the railroads did not make the Northern Securities Company the real owner of the stock in the railroads, since the effect of the transaction was to cause the Securities Company to become merely the custodian or trustee of the stock in the railroads; second, that as the two railroads were both over-capitalized, stock in them furnished no sufficient consideration for the issue of the stock of the Northern Securities Company. It would suffice to point out (a), that the proof shows that nearly nine million dollars were paid by the Securities Company for a portion of the stock acquired by it, and that, moreover, nearly thirty-five million dollars were expended by the Securities Company in the purchase of bonds of the Northern Pacific Company, which have been converted by the Securities Company into the stock of that railroad, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 367]\n\u00a0\n which the Securities Company now holds; and (b), that the market value of the railroad stocks is, moreover, indisputably shown by the proof to have been equal to the value fixed on them for the purpose of the exchange or purchase of such stock by the Northern Securities Company. Be this as it may, it is manifest that these considerations can have no possible influence on the question of the power of Congress in the premises; and therefore the suggestions can serve only to obscure the controversy. If the power was in Congress to legislate on the subject it becomes wholly immaterial what was the nature of the consideration paid by the company for the stock by it acquired and held if such acquisition and ownership, even if real, violated the act of Congress. If, on the contrary, the authority of Congress could not embrace the right of the Northern Securities Company to acquire and own the stock, the question of what consideration the Northern Securities Company paid for the stock or the method by which it was transferred must necessarily be beyond the scope of the act of Congress.\n In testing the power of Congress I shall proceed upon the assumption that the act of Congress forbids the acquisition of a majority of the stock of two competing railroads engaged in part in interstate commerce by a corporation or any combination of persons.\n The authority of Congress, it is conceded by all, must rest upon the power delegated by the 8th section of the first article of the Constitution, 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes.' The proposition upon which the case for the government depends, then, is that the ownership of stock in railroad corporations created by a state is interstate commerce, wherever the railroads engage in interstate commerce.\n At the outset, the absolute correctness is admitted of the declaration of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 368]\n\u00a0\n states and with foreign nations 'is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution;' and that if the end to be accomplished is within the scope of the Constitution, 'all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, are constitutional.'\n The plenary authority of Congress over interstate commerce, its right to regulate it to the fullest extent, to fix the rates to be charged for the movement of interstate commerce, to legislate concerning the ways and vehicles actually engaged in such traffic, and to exert any and every other power over such commerce which flows from the authority conferred by the Constitution, is thus conceded. But the concessions thus made do not concern the question in this case, which is not the scope of the power of Congress to regulate commerce, but whether the power extends to regulate the ownership of stock in railroads, which is not commerce at all. The confusion which results from failing to observe this distinction will appear from an accurate analysis of Gibbons v. Ogden, for in that case the great Chief Justice was careful to define the commerce the power to regulate which was conferred upon Congress, and in the passages which I have previously quoted, simply pointed out the rule by which it was to be determined in any case whether Congress, in acting upon the subject, had gone beyond the limits of the power to regulate commerce as it was defined in the opinion. Accepting the test announced in Gibbons v. Ogden for determining whether a given exercise of the power to regulate commerce has in effect transcended the limits of regulation, it is essential to accept also the luminous definition of commerce announced in that case and approved so many times since, and hence to test the question for decision by that definition. The definition is this: 'Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more,-it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and is regulated \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 369]\n\u00a0\n by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.' (Italics mine.)\n Does the delegation of authority to Congress to regulate commerce among the states embrace the power to regulate the ownership of stock in state corporations, because such corporations may be in part engaged in interstate commerce? Certainly not, if such question is to be governed by the definition of commerce just quoted from Gibbons v. Ogden. Let me analyze the definition. 'Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more,-it is intercourse;' that is, traffic between the states and intercourse between the states. I think the ownership of stock in a state corporation cannot be said to be in any sense traffic between the states or intercourse between them. The definition continues: 'It describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations.' Can the ownership of stock in a state corporation, by the most latitudinarian construction, be embraced by the words 'commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations?' And to remove all doubt, the definition points out the meaning of the delegation of power to regulate, since it says that it is to be 'regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.' Can it in reason be maintained that to prescribe rules governing the ownership of stock within a state, in a corporation created by it, is within the power to prescribe rules for the regulation of intercourse between citizens of different states?\n But if the question be looked at with reference to the powers of the Federal and state governments,-the general nature of the one and the local character of the other which it was the purpose of the Constitution to create and perpetuate,-it seems to me evident that the contention that the authority of the national government under the commerce clause gives the right to Congress to regulate the ownership of stock in railroads chartered by state authority is absolutely destructive of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Consti- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 370]\n\u00a0\n tution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.' This must follow, since the authority of Congress to regulate on the subject can, in reason, alone rest upon the proposition that its power over commerce embraces the right to control the ownership of railroads doing in part an interstate commerce business. But power to control the ownership of all such railroads would necessarily embrace their organization. Hence it would result that it would be in the power of Congress to abrogate every such railroad charter granted by the states from the beginning if Congress deemed that the rights conferred by such state charters tended to restrain commerce between the states or to create a monopoly concerning the same.\n Besides, if the principle be acceded to it must in reason be held to embrace every consolidation of state railroads which may do in part an interstate commerce business, even although such consolidation may have been expressly authorized by the laws of the states creating the corporations.\n It would likewise overthrow every state law forbidding such consolidations; for if the ownership of stock in state corporations be within the regulating power of Congress under the commerce clause, and can be prohibited by Congress, it would be within the power of that body to permit that which it had the right to prohibit.\n But the principle that the ownership of property is embraced within the power of Congress to regulate commerce, whenever that body deems that a particular character of ownership, if allowed to continue, may restrain commerce between the states or create a monopoly thereof, is, in my opinion, in conflict with the most elementary conceptions of rights of property. For it would follow if Congress deemed that the acquisition by one or more individuals engaged in interstate commerce of more than a certain amount of property would be prejudicial to interstate commerce, the amount of property held or the amount which could be employed in interstate commerce could be regulated. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 371]\n\u00a0\n In the argument at bar many of the consequences above indicated as necessarily resulting from the contention made were frankly admitted, since it was conceded that, even although the holding of the stock in the two railroads by the Northern Securities Company which is here assailed was expressly authorized by the laws of both the states by which the railroad corporations were created, as it was by the law of the state of New Jersey, nevertheless, as such authority, if exerted by the states, would be a regulation of interstate commerce, it would be repugnant to the Constitution as an attempt on the part of the states to interfere with the paramount authority of Congress on that subject. True, this assertion, made in the oral argument, in the printed argument is qualified by an intimation that the rule would not apply to state action taken before the adoption of the antitrust act, since up to that time, in consequence of the inaction of Congress on the subject, the states were free to legislate as they pleased regarding the matter. But this suggestion is without foundation to rest on. It has long since been determined by this court that where a particular subject-matter is national in its character and requires uniform regulation, the absence of legislation by Congress on the subject indicates the will of Congress that the subject should be free from state control. Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 238; Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist. \n120 \nU.S. 489, 493\n, 30 S. L. ed. 694, 1 Inters, Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249.\n It is said, moreover, that the decision of this case does not involve the consequences above pointed out since the only issue in this case is the right of the Northern Securities Company to acquire and own the stock. The right of that company to do so, it is argued, is one thing; the power of individuals or corporations, when not merely organized to hold stock, an entirely different thing. My mind fails to seize the distinction. The only premise by which the power of Congress can be extended to the subject- matter of the right of the Securities Company to own the stock must be the proposition that such \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 372]\n\u00a0\n ownership is within the legislative power of Congress, and if that proposition be admitted it is not perceived by what process of reasoning power of Congress over the subject-matter of ownership is to be limited to ownership by particular classes of corporations or persons. If the power embraces ownership, then the authority of Congress over all ownership which, in its judgment, may affect interstate commerce, necessarily exists. In other words, the logical result of the asserted distinction amounts to one of two things: Either that nothing is decided, or that a decree is to be entered having no foundation upon which to rest. This is said because, if the control of the ownership of stock in competing roads by one and the same corporation is within the power of Congress, and creates a restraint of trade or monopoly forbidden by Congress, it is not conceivable to me how exactly similar ownership by one or more individuals would not create the same restraint or monopoly, and be equally within the prohibition which it is decided Congress has imposed. Besides the incongruity of the conclusion, resulting from the alleged distinction, to admit it would do violence to both the letter and spirit of the Constitution; since it would in effect hold that, although a particular act was a burden upon interstate commerce or a monopoly thereof, that individuals could lawfully do the act, provided only they did not use the instrumentality of a corporation. But this court long since declared that the power to regulate commerce, conferred upon Congress, was 'general and includes alike commerce by individuals, partnerships, associations, and corporations.' Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 183, 19 L. ed. 357, 361.\n Indeed, the natural reluctance of the mind to follow an erroneous principle to its necessary conclusion, and thus to give effect to a grievous wrong arising from the erroneous principle, is an admonition that the principle itself is wrong. That admonition, I submit, is conclusively afforded by the decree which is now affirmed. Without stopping to point out what seems to me to be the confusion, contradiction, and denial of rights of property which the decree exemplifies, let me see \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 373]\n\u00a0\n if, in effect, it is not at war with itself and in conflict with the principle upon which it is assumed to be based.\n Fundamentally considered, the evil sought to be remedied is the restraint of interstate commerce and the monopoly thereof, alleged to have been brought about through the acquisition by Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hill and their friends and associates, of a controlling interest in the stock of both the roads. And yet the decree, whilst forbidding the use of the stock by the Northern Securities Company, authorizes its return to the alleged conspirators, and does not restrain them from exercising the control resulting from the ownership. If the conspiracy and combination existed and was illegal, my mind fails to perceive why it should be left to produce its full force and effect in the hands of the individuals by whom it was charged the conspiracy was entered into.\n It may, however, be said that even if the results which I have indicated be held necessarily to arise from the principles contended for by the government, it does not follow that such power would ever be exerted by Congress, or, if exerted, would be enforced to the detriment of charters granted by the states to railroads or consolidations thereof, effected under state authority, or the ownership of stock in such railroads by individuals, or the rights of individuals to acquire property by purchase, lease, or otherwise, and to make any and all contracts concerning property which may thereafter become the subject-matter of interstate commerce. The first suggestion is at once met by the consideration that it has been decided by this court that, as the anti- trust act forbids any restraint, it therefore embraces even reasonable contracts or agreements. If, then, the ownership of the stock of the two railroads by the Northern Securities Company is repugnant to the act, it follows that ownership, whether by the individual or another corporation, would be equally within the prohibitions of the act. As to the second, true it is that by the terms of the anti-trust act the power to put its provisions in motion is, as to many particulars, confided to the highest law officer of the govern- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 374]\n\u00a0\n ment; and if that officer did not invoke the aid of the courts to restrain the rights of the railroads previously chartered by the states to enjoy the benefits conferred upon them by state legislation, or to prevent individuals from exercising their right of ownership and contract, the law in these respects would remain a dead letter. But to indulge in this assumption would be but to say that the law would not be enforced by the highest law officer of the government,-a conclusion which, of course, could not be indulged in for a moment. In any view, such suggestion but involves the proposition that vast rights of property, instead of resting upon constitutional and legal sanction, must alone depend upon whether an executive officer might elect to enforce the law,-a conclusion repugnant to every principle of liberty and justice.\n Having thus by the light of reason sought to show the unsoundness of the proposition that the power of Congress to regulate commerce extends to controlling the acquisition and ownership of stock in state corporations, railroad or otherwise, because they may be doing an interstate commerce business, or to the consolidation of such companies under the sanction of state legislation, or to the right of the citizen to enjoy his freedom of contract and ownership, let me now endeavor to show, by a review of the practices of the governments, both state and national, from the beginning, and the adjudications of this court, how wanting in merit is the proposition contended for. It may not be doubted that from the foundation of the government, at all events to the time of the adoption of the anti- trust act in 1890, there was an entire absence of any legislation by Congress even suggesting that it was deemed by any one that power was possessed by Congress to control the ownership of stock in railroad or other corporations because such corporations engaged in interstate commerce. On the contrary, when Congress came to exert its authority to regulate interstate commerce as carried on by railroads, manifested by the adoption of the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154), it sedulously confined the provisions of that act to the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 375]\n\u00a0\n carrying on of interstate commerce itself, including the reasonableness of the rates to be charged for carrying on such commerce and other matters undeniably concerning the fact of interstate commerce. The same conception was manifested subsequently in legislation concerning safety appliances to be used by railroads, since the provisions of the act were confined to such appliances when actually employed in the business of interstate commerce. 27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174. It also may not be doubted that from the beginning the various states of the Union have treated the incorporation and organization of railroad companies and the ownership of stock therein as maters within their exclusive authority. Under this conception of power in the states, universally prevailing and always acted upon, the entire railroad system of the United States has been built up. Charters, leases, and consolidations under the sanction of state laws lie at the basis of that enormous sum of property and those vast interests represented by the railroads of the United States. Extracts from the reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission and from a standard authority on the subject, which were received in evidence, demonstrate that in effect nearly every great railroad system in the United States is the result of the consolidation and unification of various roads, often competitive, such consolidation or unification of management having been brought about in every conceivable form, sometimes by lease under state authority, sometimes by such leases made where there was no prohibition against them, and by stock acquisitions made by persons or corporations in order to acquire a controlling interest in both roads. Without stopping to recite details on the subject, I content myself with merely mentioning a few of the instances where great systems of railroad have been formed by the unification of the management of competitive roads, by consolidation or otherwise, often by statutory authority. These instances embrace the Boston & Maine system, the New York, New Haven, & Hartford, the New York Central, the Reading, and the Pennsylvania systems. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 376]\n\u00a0\n One of the illustrations-as to the New York Central system-is the case of the Hudson River Railroad on one side of the Hudson river and the West Shore Railroad on the other,-both parallel roads and directly competitive, and both united in one management by authority of a legislative act. It is indeed remarkable, if the whole subject was within the paramount power of Congress, and not within the authority of the states, that there should have been a universal understanding to the contrary from the beginning. When it is borne in mind that such universal action related to interests of the most vital character, involving property of enormous amount, concerning the welfare of the whole people, it is impossible in reason to deny the soundness of the assumption that it was the universal conviction that the states, and not Congress, had control of the subject-matter of the organization and ownership of railroads created by the states. And the same inference is applicable to the condition of things which has existed since the adoption of the anti-trust act in 1890. Who can deny that from that date to this, consolidations and unification of management, by means of leases, stock ownership by individuals or corporations, have been carried on, when not prohibited by state laws, to a vast extent and that during all this time, despite the energy of the government in invoking the anti-trust law that no assertion of power in Congress under that act to control the ownership of stock was ever knowingly made until first asserted in this cause. Quite recently Congress has amended the Interstate Commerce Act by provisions deemed essential to make its prohibitions more practically operative and yet no one of such provisions lends itself even to the inference that it was deemed by any one that the power of Congress extended to the control of stock ownership. Certainly the states have not so considered it. As a matter of public history it is to be observed that not long since by authority of the legislature of the state of Massachusetts, a controlling interest by lease of the Boston & Albany road passed to the New York Central systean. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 377]\n\u00a0\n The decisions of this court to my mind leave no room for doubt on the subject. As I have already shown, the very definition of the power to regulate commerce, as announced in Gibbons v. Ogden, excludes the conception that it extends to stock ownership. I shall not stop to review a multitude of decisions of this court concerning interstate commerce, which, whilst upholding the paramount authority of Congress over that subject, at the same time treated it as elementary that the effect of the power over commerce between the states was not to deprive the states of their right to legislate concerning the ownership of property of every character or to create railroad corporations and to endow them with such powers as were deemed appropriate, or to deprive the individual of his freedom to acquire, own, and enjoy property by descent, contract, or otherwise, because railroads or other property might become the subject of interstate commerce.\n In Paul v. Virginia 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357, the question was as to the power of the state of Virginia to license a foreign insurance company, and one of the contentions considered was whether the contract of insurance, since it was related to commerce, was within the regulating power of Congress, and not of the state of Virginia. The proposition was disposed of in the following language (p. 183, L. ed. p. 361):\n'Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. The policies are simply contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the corporations and the assured, for a consideration paid by the latter. These contracts are not articles of commerce in any proper meaning of the word. They are not subjects of trade and barter offered in the market as something having an existence and value independent of the parties to them. They are not commodities to be shipped or forwarded from one state to another, and then put up for sale. They are like other personal contracts between parties, which are completed by their signature and the transfer of the consideration. Such contracts are not interstate transactions, though the parties may be domiciled \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 378]\n\u00a0\n in different states. The policies do not take effect-are not executed contracts-until delivered by the agent in Virginia. They are, then, local transactions, and are governed by the local law. They do not constitute a part of the commerce between the states any more than a contract for the purchase and sale of goods in Virginia by a citizen of New York, whilst in Virginia, would constitute a portion of such commerce.'\n\n In other words, the court plainly pointed out the distinction between interstate commerce as such and the contracts concerning, or the ownership of property which might become the subjects of, interstate commerce. And the authority of Paul v. Virginia has been repeatedly approved in subsequent cases, which are so familiar as not to require citation.\n In Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, 22 L. ed. 678, the question was this: The state of Maryland had chartered the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, and in the charter had imposed upon it the duty of paying to the state a certain proportion of all its receipts from freight, which applied as well to interstate as domestic freight. The argument was that these provisions were repugnant to the commerce clause because they necessarily inereased the sum which the railroad would have to charge, and thereby constituted a regulation of commerce. The court held the law not to be repugnant to the Constitution, and in the course of the opinion said ( p. 473, L. ed. p. 684):\n'In view, however, of the very plenary powers which a state has always been conceded to have over its own territory, its highways, its franchises, and its corporations, we cannot regard the stipulation in question as amounting to either of these unconstitutional acts.'\n\n True it is that some of the expressions used in the opinion in the case just cited, giving rise to the inference that there was power in the state to regulate the rates of freight on interstate commerce, may be considered as having been overruled by Wabash, St. L. & P. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 U.S. 557\n, 30 L. ed. 244, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 31, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4. But that case also in the fullest manner pointed out the fact that the power to regulate commerce, conferred on Congress by the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 379]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, related not to the mere ownership of property or to contracts concerning property, because such property might subsequently be used in interstate commerce or become the subject of it. For instance, the definition given of interstate commerce in Gibbons v. Ogden, previously referred to, was reiterated, and in addition the definition expounded in Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 238, was approvingly quoted. That definition was as follows (p. 574, L. ed. p. 250, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 37, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 12):\n'Commerce with foreign countries and among the states, strictly considered, consists in intercourse and traffic, including in these terms navigation and the transportation and transit of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities. For the regulation of commerce as thus defined there can be only one system of rules, applicable alike to the whole country; and the authority which can act for the whole country can alone adopt such a system. Action upon it by separate states is not therefore permissible. Language affirming the exclusiveness of the grant of power over commerce as thus defined may not be inaccurate, when it would be so if applied to legislation upon subjects which are merely auxiliary to commerce.'\n\n In Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 U.S. 436\n, 38 L. ed. 773, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865, this was the question: The property of various railroad corporations operating in the state of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri had been sold under decrees of foreclosure. The purchasers of the respective lines availed themselves of the Ohio statutes and consolidated all the corporations into one so as to form a single system,-the Wabash. On presenting the articles of consolidation to the secretary of state of Ohio, that officer demanded a fee imposed by the Ohio statutes, predicated upon the sum total of the capital stock of the consolidated company. This was refused on the ground that the state of Ohio had no right to make the charge, and that its doing so was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and to the 14th Amendment. This court decided against this contention. It held that, as the right to consolidate could \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 380]\n\u00a0\n alone arise from the Ohio law, the corporation could not avail of that law and avoid the condition which the law imposed. Speaking of the consolidation, the court said (p. 440, L. ed. p. 776, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 668, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 866):\n'The rights thus sought could only be acquired by the grant of the state of Ohio, and depended for their existence upon the provisions of its laws. Without that state's consent they could not have been procured.'\n\n And, after a copious review of the authorities concerning the power of the state over the consolidation, the case was summed up by the court in the following passage (p. 446, L. ed. p. 778, Inters. Com. Rep. p.670, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 868):\n'Considering, as we do, that the payment of the charge was a condition imposed by the state of Ohio upon the taking of corporate being or the exercise of corporate franchises, the right to which depended solely on the will of that state,' (italics mine) 'and hence that liability for the charge was entirely optional, we concluds that the exaction constituted no tax upon interstate commerce, or the right to carry on the same, or the instruments thereof, and that its enforcement involved no attempt on the part of the state to extend its taxing power beyond its territorial limits.'\n\n How a right which was thus decided to depend solely upon the authority of the states can now be said to depend solely upon the will of Congress, I do not perceive.\n In United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249, the facts and the relief based on them were thus stated by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, delivering the opinion of the court (p. 9, L. ed. p. 328, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 252):\n'By the purchase of the stock of the four Philadelphia refineries, with shares of its own stock, the American Sugar Refining Company acquired nearly complete control of the manufacture of refined sugar within the United States. The bill charged that the contracts under which these purchases were made constituted combinations in restraint of trade, and that in entering into them the defendants combined and conspired to restrain the trade and commerce in refined sugar among the several states and with foreign nations, contrary to the act of Congress of July 2, 1890.' \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 381]\n\u00a0\n After referring, in a general way, to what constituted a monopoly or restraint of trade at common law, the question for decision was thus stated (p. 11, L. ed. p. 329, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 253):\n\n'The fundamental question is whether, conceding that the existence of a monopoly in manufacture is established by the evidence, that monopoly can be directly suppressed under the act of Congress in the mode attempted by this bill.'\n\n Examining this question as to the power of Congress, it was observed ( p. 11, L. ed. p. 329, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 253):\n'It cannot be denied that the power of a state to protect the lives, health, and property of its citizens, and to preserve good order and the public morals, 'the power to govern men and things within the limits of its dominion,' is a power originally and always belonging to the states; not surrendered by them to the general government, nor directly restrained by the Constitution of the United States, and essentially exclusive.'\n\n Next, pointing out that the power of Congress over interstate commerce and the fact that its failure to legislate over subjects requiring uniform legislation expressed the will of Congress that the state should be without power to act on that subject, the court came to consider whether the power of Congress to regulate commerce embraced the authority to regulate and control the ownership of stock in the state sugar refining companies, because the products of such companies, when manufactured, might become the subject of interstate commerce. Elaborately passing upon that question and reaffirming the definition of Chief Justice Marshall of commerce, in the constitutional sense, it was held that, whilst the power of Congress extended to commerce as thus defined, it did not embrace the ownership of stock in state corporations because the products of such manufacture might subsequently become the subjects of interstate commerce.\n The parallel between the two cases is complete. The one corporation acquired the stock of other and competing corporations by exchange for its own. It was conceded, for the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 382]\n\u00a0\n purposes of the case, that in doing so monopoly had been brought about in the refining of sugar, that the sugar to be produced was likely to become the subject of interstate commerce, and, indeed, that part of it would certainly become so. But the power of Congress was decided not to extend to the subject, because the ownership of the stock in the corporations was not itself commerce.\n In Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co. \n161 U.S. 646\n, 40 L. ed. 838, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, the question was whether the acquisition by the Great Northern road of a controlling interest in the stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company was a violation of a Minnesota statute prohibiting the consolidation of competing lines. It is at once evident that if the subject of consolidation was within the authority of Congress, as Congress had not expressed its will upon the subject, the act of the legislaturo of Minnesota was void because repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. But the possibility of such a contention was not thought of by either party to the cause or by the court itself. Treating the power of the state as undoubted, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, decided that the Minnesota law should be enforced. It was jointed out in the opinion that, as the charter was one granted by the state, the railroad company and the ownership of stock therein was subject to the state law, and this was made the basis of the decision. Whilst, however, resting its conclusion upon the power of the state over the corporation by it created, the court was careful to recognize that the authority in the state was so complete, as the company was a state corporation, that the state had the right, if it chose to do so, to authorize the consolidation, even although the lines were competing.\n In Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n161 U.S. 677\n, 40 L. ed. 849, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714, the power of the state to pass a law forbidding the consolidation of competing state railroad corporations doing in part an interstate commerce business was again considered and a state statute in which the power was exercised was upheld. Here, again, it is to be observed that if the consolidation of \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 383]\n\u00a0\n state railroad corporations, because they did in part an interstate commerce business, was within the paramount authority of Congress, that authority was exclusive and the state regulation which the court upheld was void. And this question, vital to the consideration of the case, and without passing upon which it could not have been decided, did not escape observation, since it was explicitly pressed upon the court and was directly determined. The court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, said ( pp. 701, 702, L. ed. pp. 859, 860, Sup. Ct. Rep. pp. 723, 724):\n'But little need be said in answer to the final contention of the plaintiff in error, that the assumption of a right to forbid the consolidation of parallel and competing lines is an interference with the power of Congress over interstate commerce. The same remark may be made with respect to all police regulations of interstate railways.\n\n ... * *\n'It has never been supposed that the dominant power of Congress over interstate commerce took from the states the power of legislation with respect to the instruments of such commerce, so far as the legislation was within its ordinary police powers. Nearly all the railways in the country have been constructed under state authority, and it cannot be supposed that they intended to abandon their power over them as soon as they were finished. The power to construct them involves necessarily the power to impose such regulations upon their operation as a sound regard for the interests of the public may seem to render desirable. In the division of authority with respect to interstate railways Congress reserves to itself the superior right to control their commerce, and forbid interference therewith; while to the states remains the power to create and to regulate the instruments of such commerce, so far as necessary to the conservation of the public interests.'\n\n How one case could be more completely decisive of another than the ruling in the case just quoted is of this, I am unable to perceive. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 384]\n\u00a0\n The subject was considered at circuit in Re Greene, 52 Fed. 105. The case was this: A person was indicted in one state for creating a monopoly in violation of the antitrust act of Congress, and was held in another state for extradition. The writ of habeas corpus was invoked, upon the contention that the face of the indictment did not state an offense against the United States, since the matters charged did not involve interstate commerce. The case is referred to, although it arose at circuit and was determined before the decisions of this court in the Pearsall and Louisville & Nashville Cases, because it was decided by Mr. Justice Jackson, then a circuit judge, who subsequently, became a member of this court. The opinion manifests that the case was considered by Judge Jackson with that care which was his conceded characteristic, and was stated by him with that lucidity which was his wont. In discharging the accused on the grounds stated in the application for the writ, Judge Jackson said (p. 112):\n'Congress may place restriction and limitations upon the right of corporations created and organized under its authority to acquire, use, and dispose of property. It may also impose such restrictions and limitations upon the citizen in respect to the exercise of a public privilege or franchise conferred by the United States. But Congress certainly has not the power or authority under the commerce clause or any other provision of the Constitution, to limit and restrict the right of corporations created by the states, or the citizens of the states, in the acquisition, control, and disposition of property. Neither can Congress regulate or prescribe the price or prices at which such property or the products thereof, shall be sold by the owner or owners, whether corporations or individuals. It is equally clear that Congress has no jurisdiction over, and cannot make criminal, the aims, purposes, and intentions of persons in the acquisition and control of property which the states of their residence or creation sanction and permit. It is not material that such property, or the products thereof, may become the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 385]\n\u00a0\n subject of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations. Commerce among the states, within the exclusive regulating power of Congress, 'consists of intercourse and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transportation of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities.' Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n-702, 26 L. ed. 238-241; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 203\n, 29 L. ed. 192, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826. In the application of this comprehensive definition, it is settled by the decision of the Supreme Court that such commerce includes not only the actual transportation of commodities and persons between the states, but also the instrumentalities and processes of such transportation.\n\n ... * *\n'That neither the production nor manufacture of articles or commodities which constitute subjects of commerce, and which are intended for trade and traffic with citizens of other states, nor the preparation for their transportation from the state where produced or manufactured, prior to the commencement of the actual transfer or transmission thereof to another state, constitutes that interstate commerce which comes within the regulating power of Congress; and, further, that after the termination of the transportation of commodities or articles of traffic from one state to another, of in the general mass of property in the of in the general mass of property in the state of destination, the sale, distribution, and consumption thereof in the latter state forms no part of interstate commerce.'\n\n If this opinion had been written in the case now considered it could not more completely than its reasoning does have disposed of the contention that the ownership of stock by a corporation in competing railroads was commerce.\n United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540, was this: A large number of railway companies, who were made defendants in the cause had formed themselves into an association, known as the Trans-Missouri Freight Association, and the companies had bound themselves by the provisions contained in the articles of agreement. Many stipulations relating to \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 386]\n\u00a0\n the carrying on of interstate commerce over the roads which were parties to the agreement were contained in it, and  3 provided as follows:\n'A committee shall be appointed to establish rates, rules, and regulations on the traffic subject to this association, and to consider changes therein, and make rules for meeting the competition of outside lines. Their conclusions, when unanimous, shall be made effective when they so order, but if they differ the question at issue shall be referred to the managers of the lines parties hereto, and if they disagree it shall be arbitrated in the manner provided in article 7.'\n\n The government sought to dissolve the association on the ground that the agreement restrained commerce between the states, and therefore was in violation of the anti-trust act. On the hearing in this court, as the agreement directly related in many particulars to interstate transportation and the charge to be made therefor, it was conceded on all hands that it embraced subject which came within the power of Congress to regulate commerce. The contentions on behalf of the association were these: First. That the movement of interstate commerce by railroads was not within the anti-trust act, since Congress had regulated that subject by the Interstate Commerce Act, and did not intend to amplify its provisions in any respect by the subsequent enactment of the anti-trust law. Second. That even if this were not the case, and the movement of interstate commerce by railroads was affected by the anti-trust statute, the particular agreement in question did not violate the act, because the agreement did not unreasonably restrain interstate commerce. Both these contentions were decided against the association, the court holding that the antitrust act did embrace interstate carriage by railroad corporations, and as that act prohibited any contract in restraint of interstate commerce, it hence embraced all contracts of that character, whether they were reasonable or unreasonable.\n The same subject was considered in a subsequent case \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 387]\n\u00a0\n (United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25). In that case also there was no question that the agreement between the railroads related to the movement of interstate commerce, but it was insisted that the particular agreement there involved did not seek to fix rates, but only to secure the continuation of just rates which had already been fixed, and hence was not within the anti-trust law. If this were held not to be true, a reconsideration of the questions decided in the Freight Association Case was invoked. The court reviewed and reiterated the rulings made in the Freight Association Case and held that the particular agreement in question came within them.\n I mention these two last cases, not because they are apposite to the case in hand, for they are not, since the contracts which were involved in them confessedly concerned interstate commerce, whilst in this case the sole question is whether the ownership of stock in competing railroads does involve interstate commerce. The cases are referred to in connection with the decisions previously cited, because, taken together, they illustrate the distinction which this court has always maintained between the power of Congress over interstate commerce and its want of authority to regulate subjects not embraced within that grant. The same distinction is aptly shown in subsequent cases.\n Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, involved whether a particular agreement entered into between persons carrying on the business of selling cattle on commission exclusively at the Kansas City stock yards was valid. At those yards cattle were received in vast numbers through the channels of interstate commerce, and from thence were distributed through such channels. For these reasons the business of those engaged exclusively in the sale of cattle on the stock yards was asserted to be interstate commerce and within the power of Congress to regulate. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Peckham, it was at the outset said (p. 586, L. ed. p. 294, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 43):\n'The relief sought in this case is based exclusively on the \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 388]\n\u00a0\n act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, chap. 647, entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies,' commonly spoken of as the anti-trust act. (26 Stat. at L. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.)\n\n'The act has reference only to that trade or commerce which exists, or may exist, among the several states or with foreign nations, and has no application whatever to any other trade or commerce.\n\n'The question meeting us at the threshold, therefore, in this case is, What is the nature of the business of the defendants, and are the by-laws or any subdivision of them above referred to, in their direct effect in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations; or does the case made by the bill and answer show that any one of the above defendants has monopolized, or attempted to monopolize, or combined or conspired with other persons to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations?'\n\n Proceeding, then, to consider the agreement, it was pointed out that the contention that the sale of cattle on the stock yards constituted interstate commerce was without merit. The distinction between interstate commerce as such and the power to make contracts and to buy and sell property was clearly stated, and because of that distinction the agreement was held not to be within the act of Congress, because that act could and did only relate to interstate commerce.\n And on the day the decision just referred to was announced another case under the anti-trust act was decided. Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 43 L. ed. 300, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. The difference between that case and the Hopkins Case was thus stated by Mr. Justice Peckham, in delivering the opinion of the court (p. 612, L. ed. p. 304, Sup. Ct. Rep. 52).\n'This case differs from that of Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, in the fact that these defendants are themselves purchasers of cattle on the market, while the defendants in the Hopkins Case were only commission merchants who sold the cattle upon commission as a compensation for their services. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 389]\n\u00a0\n 'Counsel for the government assert that any agreement or combination among buyers of cattle coming from other states, of the nature of the by- laws in question, is an agreement or combination in restraint of interstate trade or commerce.'\n\n The court, however, said it did not deem it necessary to decide whether the fact that the merchants who entered into the agreement bought cattle in other states and shipped them to other states, caused their business to be interstate commerce, because, in any event, the court was of opinion that the agreement which was assailed, even if it involved interstate commerce, was not in violation of any of the provisions of the anti-trust act.\n The Anderson Case was followed by Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96. The case involved deciding whether a particular combination of pipe manufacturers, looking to the control of the sale and transportation of such pipe over a large territory, embracing many states and a division of the territory between the members of the combination, was within the prohibitions of the anti-trust act. Coming to consider the subject, the court, through Mr. Justice Peckham, analyzed the contract and pointed out its monopolistic features. In answer to the argument that the matter complained of was not commerce, because it related only to a sale of pipe, and therefore was within the rule announced in the Knight and Hopkins Cases, the Knight Case was approvingly reviewed, and its doctrine in effect was reaffirmed, the court observing (p. 240, L. ed. p. 147, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 107):\n'The direct purpose of the combination in the Knight Case was the control of the manufacture of sugar. There was no combination bination or agreement, in terms, regarding the future disposition of the manufactured article; nothing looking to a transaction in the nature of interstate commerce.\n\n ... * *\n'We think the case now before us involves contracts of the nature last above mentioned, not incidentally or collaterally, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 390]\n\u00a0\n but as a direct and immediate result of the combination engaged in by the defendants. . . . The defendants, by reason of this combination and agreement, could only send their goods out of the state in which they were manufactured for sale and delivery in another state, upon the terms and pursuant to the provisions of such combination. As pertinently asked by the court below, was not this a direct restraint upon interstate commerce in those goods?' (Italics mine.)\n\n Having thus found that the agreement concerned interstate commerce because it directly purported to control the movement of goods from one state to the other, and, besides, sought to prohibit that movement or restrict the same to particular individuals, it was held that the contract was, for these reasons, within the prohibitions of the act of Congress, and was therefore void. I do not pause to consider the case of W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry (decided at this term), \n193 U.S. 38\n, ante, 307, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307, since on the face of the opinion it is patent that the contract directly concerned the shipment of goods from one state to another and this was the sole and exclusive basis of the decision.\n Now, it is submitted, that the decided cases just reviewed demonstrate that the acquisition and ownership of stock in competing railroads, organized under state law, by several persons or by corporations, is not interstate commerce, and, therefore, not subject to the control of Congress. It is, indeed, suggested that the cases establish a contrary doctrine. This is sought to be demonstrated by quoting passages from the opinions separated from their context, apart from the questions which the cases involved. But as the issues which were decided in the Knight, in the Pearsall, in the Louisville & Nashville Case and in the Hopkins Case directly exclude the significance attributed to the passages from the opinions in those cases relied upon, it must follow that if such passages could, when separated from their context, have the meaning attributed to them the expressions would be mere obiter. And this consideration renders it unnecessary for me to analyze the passages to show that when they are read in connection with their con- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 391]\n\u00a0\n text they have not the meaning now sought to be attached to them. But other considerations equally render it unnecessary to particularly review the sentences relied upon. There can be no doubt that it was expressly decided in the Knight Case that the acquisition of stock by one corporation in other corporations so as to control them all was not interstate commerce, although the goods of the manufacturing companies whose stock was acquired might become the subject of interstate commerce. If, then, the passage from the Knight Case could be given the meaning sought to be affixed to it, the result would be but to say that that case overruled itself. And this would be the result in the Pearsall Case, since in that case it was decided that the states had the power to forbid the consolidation of competing railroads, even by means of the acquisition of stock. Besides, as in the Louisville & Nashville Case, immediately following the Pearsall, it was expressly decided that the interstate commerce power of Congress did not embrace such consolidation, and Congress, therefore, could not restrain a state from either forbidding or permitting it to take place, it would follow that if the sentences in the Pearsall Case had the import now applied to them, that that case not only overruled itself, but was besides overruled by the Louisville & Nashville Case, and this although the two cases were decided on the same day, the opinions in both cases having been delivered by the same justice.\n The same confusion and contradiction arises from separating from their context and citing as applicable to this case passages from the opinions in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases. Those cases, as I have previously stated, related exclusively to a contract admittedly involving interstate commerce, and it was decided that any restraint of such commerce was forbidden by the anti-trust act. Now, in the Hopkins Case, decided subsequent to the Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases, the contract considered unquestionably involved a restraint, but, as such restraint did not concern interstate commerce, it was held not to come within the power of Congress. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 392]\n\u00a0\n It would follow then, if the sentences quoted from the opinions in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases, which cases concermed only that which was completely interstate commerce, applied to that which was not such commerce, that the Hopkins Case overruled both these cases, although the opinions in all of the cases were delivered by the same justice, and no intimation was suggested of such overruling. It would also result that, after having overruled those cases in the Hopkins Case, the court, in expressing its opinion through the same justice, proceeded in the Addyston Pipe Case, which related only to interstate commerce, to overrule the Hopkins Case and reaffirm the prior cases.\n Of course, in my opinion, there is no ground for holding that the decided cases embody such extreme contradictions or produce such utter confusion. The cases are all consistent, if only the elementary distinction upon which they proceeded be not obscured,-that is, the difference which arises from the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, on the one hand, and its want of authority, on the other, to regulate that which is not interstate commerce. Indeed, the confounding and treating as one, things which are wholly different, is the error permeating all the contentions for the government.\n What has been previously said suffices to show the reasons which control my judgment, and I might well say nothing more. There were, however, three propositions so earnestly pressed by the government at bar upon the theory that they demonstrate that common ownership of a majority of the stock of competing railroads is subject to the regulating power of Congress that I propose to briefly give the reasons which cause me to conclude that the contentions relied upon are without merit.\n\n 1. \nThis court, it is urged, has frequently declared that the power of Congress over interstate commerce includes the authority to regulate the instrumentalities of such commerce, and the following cases are cited: Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Fuller, 17 Wall. 560, 21 L. ed. 710; Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 23 L. ed. 347; Pensacola Teleg. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 393]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 U.S. 1\n, 24 L. ed. 708; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 196\n, 29 L. ed. 158, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826. To these cases might be added many others, including some of those which have been previously referred to by me. The argument now made is, as the power extends to instrumentalities, and railroads are such instrumentalities, therefore the acquisition and ownership of railroads by persons or corporations is commerce and subject to the power of Congress to regulate. But this involves a non sequitur, and a confusion of thought arising from again confounding as one things which are wholly different. True, the instrumentalities of interstate commerce are subject to the power to regulate commerce, and therefore such instrumentalities when employed in interstate commerce may be regulated by Congress as to their use in such commerce. But this is entirely distinct from the power to regulate the acquisition and ownership of such instrumentalities, and the many forms of contracts from which such ownership may arise. The same distinction exists between the two which obtains between the power of Congress to regulate the movement of property in the channels of interstate commerce and its want of authority to regulate the acquisition and ownership of the same property. This difference was pointed out in the cases which have been referred to, and the distinction between the two has been from the beginning the dividing line, demarking the power of the national government on the one hand and of the states on the other. All the rights of ownership in railroads belonging to corporations organized under the state law, the power to acquire the same, to mortgage, to foreclose mortgages, to lease and the contract relations concerning them, have, from the foundation, had their sanction in the legislation of the several states. One may search in vain in the acts of Congress for any legislation even suggesting that the power over these subjects was deemed to be in Congress. On the contrary, the legislation of Congress concerning the instrumentalities of railroads under the interstate commerce power clearly refutes the contention, since that legislation relates only to such instrumentalities \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 394]\n\u00a0\n during their actual use in interstate commerce, and not otherwise. How, consistently with the proposition, can the great number of cases be explained which, in both the Federal and state courts, have dealt with the ownership of railroads and their instrumentalities by foreclosure and otherwise under the assumption that the rights of the parties were controlled by state laws governing the subject? And here again it would follow, if the proposition was adopted, that all the vast body of state legislation on the subject would be void from the beginning and the enormous sum of property rights depending upon such legislation would be impaired and lost, since, if the subject were within the power of Congress, it was one requiring a uniform regulation, and therefore the inaction of Congress would signify an entire want of power in the states over the subject.\n\n 2. \nThe court it is urged, has in a number of cases, declared that the several states were without power to directly burden interstate commerce. The acquiring and ownership by one person or corporation of a majority of the stock in competing railroads engaged in interstate commerce, it is argued, being a direct burden, therefore power to regulate the subject is in Congress, and not in the states. Undoubtedly, not only in the decisions referred to, but in many others, including most of those which have been by me quoted, the absolute want of power in the states to legislate concerning interstate commerce or to bunder it directly has been declared, and the doctrine in its fullest scope is too elementary to require citation of authority. But to decide this case upon the assumption that the acquisition and ownership of stock in competing railroads engaged in interstate commerce is a regulation of commerce, or, what is the same thing, a direct burden on it, would be but to assume the question arising for decision.\n Where an authority is exerted by a state which is within its power, and that authority as exercised does not touch interstate commerce or its instrumentalities, and can only have an effect upon such commerce by reason of the reflex and remote results \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 395]\n\u00a0\n of the exertion of the lawful power, it cannot be said, without a contradiction in terms, that the power exercised is a regulation, because a direct burden upon commerce. To say to the contrary would be to declare that no power on any subject, however local in its character, could be exercised by the states if it was deemed by Congress or the courts that there would be produced some effect upon interstate commerce. The question whether a burden is direct and therefore constitutes a regulation of interstate commerce is to be determined by ascertaining whether the power exerted is lawful, generally speaking, and then by finding whether its exercise in the particular case was such as to cause it to be illegal, because directly burdening interstate commerce. If, in a given case, the power be lawful and the mode in which it is exercised be not such as to directly burden, there is no regulation of commerce, although, as an indirect result of the exertion of the lawful power, some ffect may be produced upon commerce. In other words, where the power is lawful but it is asserted that it has been so exerted as to amount to a direct burden, there must be, so to speak, a privity between the manifestation of the power and the resulting burden. The distinction is well illustrated by the cases which have been referred to, and was very lucidly pointed out by Judge Jackson in the Greene Case. Take the Knight Case. There, as the contract merely concerned the purchase of stock in the refineries, and contained no condition relating to the movement in interstate commerce of the goods to be manufactured by the refining companies, the court held, as the right to acquire was not within the commerce clause, the fact that the owners of the manufactured product might thereafter so act concerning the product as to burden commerce, there was no direct burden resulting from the mere acquisition and ownership. On the contrary, in the Addyston Pipe Case, after stating in the fullest way the paramount authority of Congress concerning commerce, the court approached the terms of the contract in order to determine whether it related to interstate commerce, and if it did, whether it created a direct burden. In doing so, as it \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 396]\n\u00a0\n found that the contract both related to interstate commerce and directly burdened the same, the contract was held to be void. This case comes within the Knight Case. It concerns the acquisition and ownership of stock. No contract is in question made by the owners of the stock controlling the railroads in the performance of their duties as carriers of interstate commerce. The sole contention is that as the result of the ownership of the stock there may arise, in the operation of the roads, a burden of interstate commerce. That is, that such burden may indirectly result from the acquisition and ownership. To maintain the contention, therefore, it must be decided that because ownership of property, if acquired, may be so used as to burden commerce, therefore to acquire and own is to burden. This, however, would be but to declare that that which was in its very nature and essence indirect is direct.\n\n 3. \nBut, it is said, it may not be denied that the common ownership of stock in competing railroads endows the holders of the majority railroads and with the authority, if they railroads and with the authority, it they choose to exert it, to so unify the management of the roads as to suppress competition between them. This power, it is insisted, is within the regulating authority of Congress over interstate commerce. In other words, the contention broadly is that Congress has not only the authority to regulate the exercise of interstate commerce, but under that power has the right to regulate the ownership and possession of property, if the enjoyment of such rights would enable those who possessed them if they engaged in interstate commerce to exert a power over the same. But this proposition only asserts in another form that the right to acquire the stock was interstate commerce, and therefore was within the authority of Congress, and is refuted by the reasons and authorities already advanced. That the proposition, if adopted, would extend the power of Congress to all subjects essentially local, as already stated in considering the previous proposition, is to my mind manifest. So clearly is this the result of the particular proposition now being considered, that, \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 397]\n\u00a0\n at the risk of repetition, I again illustrate the subject. Under this doctrine the sum of property to be acquired by individuals or by corporations, the contracts which they may make, would be within the regulating power of Congress. If it were judged by Congress that the farmer in sowing his crops should be limited to a certain production because overproduction would give power to affect commerce, Congress could regulate that subject. If the acquisition of a large amount of property by an individual was deemed by Congress to confer upon him the power to affect interstate commerce if he engaged in it, Congress could regulate that subject. If the wage-earner organized to better his condition and Congress believed that the existence of such organization would give power, if it were exerted, to affect interstate commerce, Congress could forbid the organization of all labor associations. Indeed, the doctrine must in reason lead to a concession of the right in Congress to regulate concerning the aptitude, the character, and capacity of persons. If individuals were deemed by Congress to be possessed of such ability that participation in the management of two great competing railroad enterprises would endow them with the power to injuriously affect interstate commerce, Congress could forbid such participation. If the principle were adopted, and the power which would arise from so doing were exercised, the result would be not only to destroy the state and Federal governments, but, by the implication of authority, from which the destruction would be brought about, there would be erected upon the ruins of both a government endowed with the arbitrary power to disregard the great guaranty of life, liberty, and property and every other safeguard upon which organized civil society depends. I say the guaranty, because in my opinion the three are indissolubly united, and one cannot be destroyed without the other. Of course, to push propositions to the extreme to which they naturally lead is often an unsafe guide. But at the same time the conviction cannot be escaped by me that principles and conduct bear a relation one to the other, especially in matters of public concern. The fathers \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 398]\n\u00a0\n founded our government upon an enduring basis of right, principle and of limitation of power. Destroy the principles and the limitations which they impose, and I am unable to say that conduct may not, when unrestrained, give rise to action doing violence to the great truths which the destroyed principles embodies.\n The fallacy of all the contentions of the government is, to my mind, illustrated by the summing up of the case for the government made in the argument at bar. The right to acquire and own the stock of competing railroads involves, says that summing up, the power of an individual 'to do' (italics mine) absolutely as he pleases with his own, whilst the claim of the government is that the right of the owner of property 'to do' ( italics mine) as he pleases with his own may be controlled in the public interest by legitimate legislation. But the case involves the right to acquire and own, not the right 'to do' (italics mine). Confusing the two gives rise to the errors which it has been my endeavor to point out. Undoubtedly the states possess power over corporations created by them, to permit or forbid consolidation, whether accomplished by stock ownership or otherwise, to forbid one corporation from holding stock in another, and to impose on this or other subjects such regulations as may be deemed best. Generally speaking, however, the right to do these things springs alone from the fact that the corporation is created by the state, and holds its rights subject to the conditions attached to the grant, or to such regulations as the creator, the state, may lawfully impose upon its creature, the corporation. Moreover, irrespective of the relation of creator and creature, it is, of course, true in a general sense that government possesses the authority to regulate, within certain just limits, what an owner may do with his property. But the first power which arises from the authority of a grantor to exact conditions in making a grant or to regulate the conduct of the grantee gives no sanction to the proposition that a government, irrespective of its power to grant, has the general authority to \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 399]\n\u00a0\n limit the character and quantity of property which may be acquired and owned. And the second power, the general governmental one, to reasonably control the use of property, affords no foundation for the proposition that there exists in government a power to limit the quantity and character of property which may be acquired and owned. The difference between the two is that which exists between a free and constitutional government, restrained by law, an absolute government, unrestrained by any of the principles which are necessary for the perpetuation of society, and the protection of life, liberty, and property.\n It cannot be denied that the sum of all just governmental power was enjoyed by the states and the people before the Constitution of the United States was formed. None of that power was abridged by that instrument except as restrained by constitutional safeguards, and hence none was lost by the adoption of the Constitution. The Constitution, whilst distributing the pre-existing authority, preserved it all. With the full power of the states over corporations created by them and with their authority in respect to local legislation, and with power in Congress over interstate commerce carried to its fullest degree, I cannot conceive that if these powers, admittedly possessed by both, be fully exerted, a remedy cannot be provided fully adequate to suppress evils which may arise from combinations deemed to be injurious. This must be true unless it be concluded that, by the effect of the mere distribution of power made by the Constitution, partial impotency of governmental authority has resulted. But if this be conceded, arguendo, the Constitution itself has pointed out the method by which, if changes are needed, they may be brought about. No remedy, in my opinion, for any supposed or real infirmity, can be afforded by disregarding the Constitution, by destroying the lines which separate state and Federal authority, and by implying the existence of a power which is repugnant to all those fundamental rights of life, liberty, and property upon which just government must rest. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 400]\n\u00a0\n If, however, the question of the power of Congress be conceded, and the assumption as to the meaning of the anti-trust act which has been indulged in for the purpose of considering that power be put out of view, it would yet remain to be determined whether the anti-trust act embraced the acquisition and ownership of the stock in question by the Northern Securities Company. It is unnecessary for me, however, to state the reasons which have led me to the conclusion that the act, when properly interpreted, does not embrace the acquisition and ownership of such stock, since that subject is considered in an opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes, which explains the true interpretation of the statute, as it is understood by me, more clearly than I would be able to do.\n Being of the opinion, for the reasons heretofore given, that Congress was without power to regulate the acquisition and ownership of the stock in question by the Northern Securities Company, and because I think even if there were such power in Congress, it has not been exercised by the anti-trust act, as is shown in the opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes, I dissent.\n I am authorized to say that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Peckham, and Mr. Justice Holmes concur in this dissent. \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 401]\n\u00a0\n exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful, and before which even well settled principles of law will bend. What we have to do in this case is to find the meaning of some not very difficult words. We must try,-I have tried,-to do it with the same freedom of natural and spontaneous interpretation that one would be sure of if the same question arose upon an indictment for a similar act which excited no public attention, and was of importance only to a prisoner before the court. Furthermore, while at times judges need for their work the training of economists or statesmen, and must act in view of their foresight of consequences, yet, when their task is to interpret and apply the words of a statute, their function is merely academic to begin with,-to read English intelligently,-and a consideration of consequences comes into play, if at all, only when the meaning of the words used is open to reasonable doubt.\n The question to be decided is whether, under the act of July 2, 1890 ( 26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200), it is unlawful, at any stage of the process, if several men unite to form a corporation for the purpose of buying more than half the stock of each of two competing interstate railroad companies, if they form the corporation, and the corporation buys the stock. I will suppose further that every step is taken, from the beginning, with the single intent of ending competition between the companies. I make this addition not because it may not be and is not disputed, but because, as I shall try to show, it is totally unimportant under any part of the statute with which we have to deal.\n The statute of which we have to find the meaning is a criminal statute. The two sections on which the government relies both make certain acts crimes. That is their immediate purpose and that is what they say. It is vain to insist that this is not a criminal proceeding. The words cannot be read one way in a suit which is to end in fine and imprisonment and another way in one which seeks an injunction. The construction which is adopted in this case must be adopted in one \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 402]\n\u00a0\n of the other sort. I am no friend of artificial interpretations because a statute is of one kind rather than another, but all agree that before a statute is to be taken to punish that which always has been lawful, it must express its intent in clear words. So I say we must read the words before us as if the question were whether two small exporting grocers should go to jail.\n Again, the statute is of a very sweeping and general character. It hits 'every' contract or combination of the prohibited sort, great or small, and 'every' person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize, in the sense of the act, 'any part' of the trade or commerce among the several states. There is a natural inclination to assume that it was directed against certain great combinations, and to read it in that light. It does not say so. On the contrary, it says 'every,' and 'any part.' Still less was it directed specially against railroads. There even was a reasonable doubt whether it included railroads until the point was decided by this court.\n Finally, the statute must be construed in such a way as not merely to save its constitutionality, but, so far as is consistent with a fair interpretation, not to raise grave doubts on that score. I assume, for the purposes of discussion, although it would be a great and serious step to take, that in some case that seemed to it to need heroic measures, Congress might regulate not only commerce, but instruments of commerce, or contracts the bearing of which upon commerce would be only indirect. But it is clear that the mere fact of an indirect effect upon commerce, not shown to be certain and very great, would not justify such a law. The point decided in United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 39 S. L. ed. 325, 331, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249, 255, was that 'the fact . . . that trade or commerce might be indirectly affected was not enough to entitle complainants to a decree.' Commerce depends upon population, but Congress could not, on that ground, undertake to regulate marriage and divorce. If the act before us is to be carried out according to what seems to me the logic of the argument for the government, which I do \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 403]\n\u00a0\n not believe that it will be, I can see no part of the conduct of life with which, on similar principles, Congress might not interfere.\n This act is construed by the government to affect the purchasers of shares in two railroad companies because of the effect it may have, or, if you like, is certain to have, upon the competition of these roads. If such a remote result of the exercise of an ordinary incident of property and personal freedom is enough to make that exercise unlawful, there is hardly any transaction concerning commerce between the states that may not be made a crime by the finding of a jury or a court. The personal ascendency of one man may be such that it would give to his advice the effect of a command, if he owned but a single share in each road. The tendency of his presence in the stockholders' meetings might be certain to prevent competition, and thus his advice, if not his mere existence, become a crime.\n I state these general considerations as matters which I should have to take into account before I could agree to affirm the decree appealed from, but I do not need them for my own opinion, because, when I read the act I cannot feel sufficient doubt as to the meaning of the words to need to fortify my conclusion by any generalities. Their meaning seems to me plain on their face.\n The 1st section makes 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations' a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. Much trouble is made by substituting other phrases assumed to be equivalent, which then are reasoned from as if they were in the act. The court below argued as if maintaining competition were the expressed object of the act. The act says nothing about competition. I stick to the exact words used. The words hit two classes of cases, and only two,-contracts in restraint of trade and combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade,-and we have to consider what \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 404]\n\u00a0\n these respectively are. Contracts in restraint of trade are dealt with and defined by the common law. They are contracts with a stranger to the contractor's business (although, in some cases, carrying on a similar one), which wholly or partially restrict the freedom of the contractor in carrying on that business as otherwise he would. The objection of the common law to them was, primarily, on the contractor's own account. The notion of monopoly did not come in unless the contract covered the whole of England. Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181. Of course, this objection did not apply to partnerships or other forms, if there were any, of substituting a community of interest where there had been competition. There was no objection to such combinations merely as in restraint of trade or otherwise unless they amounted to a monopoly. Contracts in restraint of trade, I repeat, were contracts with strangers to the contractor's business, and the trade restrained was the contractor's own.\n Combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, on the other hand, were combinations to keep strangers to the agreement out of the business. The objection to them was not an objection to their effect upon the parties making the contract, the members of the combination or firm, but an objection to their intended effect upon strangers to the firm and their supposed consequent effect upon the public at large. In other words, they were regarded as contrary to public policy because they monopolized, or attempted to monopolize, some portion of the trade or commerce of the realm. See United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. All that is added to the 1st section by  2 is that like penalties are imposed upon every single person who, without combination, monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, commerce among the states; and that the liability is extended to attempting to monopolize any part of such trade or commerce. It is more important as an aid to the construction of  1 than it is on its own account. It shows that whatever is criminal when done by way of combination is equally criminal if done by a single man. That I am right in my interpretation \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 405]\n\u00a0\n of the words of  1 is shown by the words 'in the form of trust or otherwise.' The prohibition was suggested by the trusts, the trusts, the objection to which, as every one knows, was not the union of former competitors, but the sinister power exercised or supposed to be exercised by the combination in keeping rivals out of the business and ruining those who already were in. It was the ferocious extreme of competition with others, not the cessation of competition among the partners, that was the evil feared. Further proof is to be found in  7, giving an action to any person injured in his business or property by the forbidden conduct. This cannot refer to the parties to the agreement, and plainly means that outsiders who are injured in their attempt to compete with a trust or other similar combination may recover for it. W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, ante, 307, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307. How effective the section may be or how far it goes is not material to my point. My general summary of the two classes of cases which the act affects is confirmed by the title, which is 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies.'\n What I now ask is under which of the foregoing classes this case is supposed to come; and that question must be answered as definitely and precisely as if we were dealing with the indictments which logically ought to follow this decision. The provision of the statute against contracts in restraint of trade has been held to apply to contracts between railroads, otherwise remaining independent, by which they restricted their respective freedom as to rates. This restriction by contract with a stranger to the contractor's buisiness is the ground of the decision in United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25, following and affirming United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540. I accept those decisions absolutely, not only as binding upon me, but as decisions which I have no desire to criticize or abridge. But the provision has not been decided, and, it seems to me, could not be decided without a perversion of plain language, to apply to an arrangement by which competition is ended through com- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 406]\n\u00a0\n munity of interest,-an arrangement which leaves the parties without external restriction. That provision, taken alone, does not require that all existing competitions shall be maintained. It does not look primarily, if at all, to competition. It simply requires that a party's freedom in trade between the states shall not be cut down by contract with a stranger. So far as that phrase goes, it is lawful to abolish competition by any form of union. It would seem to me impossible to say that the words 'every contract in restraint of trade is a crime, punishable with imprisonment,' would sent the members of a partnership between, or a consolidation of, two trading corporations to prison,-still more impossible to say that it forbade one man or corporation to purchase as much stock as he liked in both. Yet those words would have that effect if this clause of  1 applies to the defendants here. For it cannot be too carefully remembered that that clause applies to 'every' contract of the forbidden kind,-a consideration which was the turning point of the Trans-Missouri Freight Association's Case.\n If the statute applies to this case it must be because the parties, or some of them, have formed, or because the Northern Securities Company is, a combination in restraint of trade among the states, or, what comes to the same thing, in my opinion, because the defendants, or some or one of them, are monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, some part of the commerce between the states. But the mere reading of those words shows that they are used in a limited and accurate sense. According to popular speech, every concern monopolizes whatever business it does, and if that business is trade between two states it monopolizes a part of the trade among the states. Of course, the statute does not forbid that. It does not mean that all business must cease. A single railroad down a narrow valley or through a mountain gorge monopolizes all the railroad transportation through that valley or gorge. Indeed, every railroad monopolizes, in a popular sense, the trade of some area. Yet I suppose no one would say that \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 407]\n\u00a0\n the statute forbids a combination of men into a corporation to build and run such a railroad between the states.\n I assume that the Minnesota charter of the Great Northern, and the Wisconsin charter of the Northern Pacific, both are valid. Suppose that, before either road was built, Minnesota, as part of a system of transportation between the states, had created a railroad company authorized singly to build all the lines in the states now actually built, owned, or controlled by either of the two existing companies. I take it that that charter would have been just as good as the present one, even if the statutes which we are considering had been in force. In whatever sense it would have created a monopoly, the present charter does. It would have been a large one, but the act of Congress makes no discrimination according to size. Size has nothing to do with the matter. A monopoly of 'any part' of commerce among the states is unlawful. The supposed company would have owned lines that might have been competing; probably the present one does. But the act of Congress will not be construed to mean the universal disintegration of society into single men, each at war with all the rest, or even the prevention of all further combinations for a common end.\n There is natural feeling that somehow or other the statute meant to strike at combinations great enough to cause just anxiety on the part of those who love their country more than money, while it viewed such little ones as I have supposed with just indifference. This notion, it may be said, somehow breathes from the pores of the act, although it seems to be contradicted in every way by the words in detail. And it has occurred to me that it might be that when a combination reached a certain size it might have attributed to it more of the character of a monopoly merely by virtue of its size than would be attributed to a smaller one. I am quite clear that it is only in connection with monopolies that size could play any part. But my answer has been indicated already. In the first place, size, in the case of railroads, is an inevitable incident; and if it were an \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 408]\n\u00a0\n objection under the act, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific already were too great and encountered the law. In the next place, in the case of railroads it is evident that the size of the combination is reached for other ends than those which would make them monopolies. The combinations are not formed for the purpose of excluding others from the field. Finally, even a small railroad will have the same tendency to exclude others from its narrow area that great ones have to exclude others from the greater one, and the statute attacks the small monopolies as well as the great. The very words of the act make such a distinction impossible in this case, and it has not been attempted in express terms.\n If the charter which I have imagined above would have been good notwithstanding the monopoly, in a popular sense, which it created, one next is led to ask whether and why a combination or consolidation of existing roads, although in actual competition, into one company of exactly the same powers and extent, would be any more obnoxious to the law. Although it was decided in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n161 \nU.S. 677, 701\n, 40 S. L. ed. 849, 859, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714, that since the statute, as before, the states have the power to regulate the matter, it was said, in the argument, that such a consolidation would be unlawful, and it seems to me that the Attorney General was compelled to say so in order to maintain his case. But I think that logic would not let him stop there, or short of denying the power of a state at the present time to authorize one company to construct and own two parallel lines that might compete. The monopoly would be the same as if the roads were consolidated after they had begun to compete; and it is on the footing of monopoly that I now am supposing the objection made. But to meet the objection to the prevention of competition at the same time, I will suppose that three parties apply to a state for charters; one for each of two new and possibly competing lines respectively, and one for both of these lines, and that the charter is granted to the last. I think that charter would be good, and I think the whole argument to the contrary rests \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 409]\n\u00a0\n on a popular instead of an accurate and legal conception of what the word 'monopolize' in the statute means. I repeat, that in my opinion there is no attempt to monopolize, and what, as I have said, in my judgment amounts to the same thing, that there is no combination in restraint of trade until something is done with the intent to exclude strangers to the combination from competing with it in some part of the business which it carries on.\n Unless I am entirely wrong in my understanding of what a 'combination in restraint of trade' means, then the same monopoly may be attempted and effected by an individual, and is made equally illegal in that case by  2. But I do not expect to hear it maintained that Mr. Morgan could be sent to prison for buying as many shares as he liked of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific, even if he bought them both at the same time and got more than half the stock of each road.\n There is much that was mentioned in argument which I pass by. But in view of the great importance attached by both sides to the supposed attempt to suppress competition, I must say a word more about that. I said at the outset that I should assume, and I do assume, that one purpose of the purchase was to suppress competition between the two roads. I appreciate the force of the argument that there are independent stockholders in each; that it cannot be presumed that the respective boards of directors will propose any illegal act; that if they should they could be restrained, and that all that has been done as yet is too remote from the illegal result to be classed even as an attempt. Not every act done in furtherance of an unlawful end is an attempt or contrary to the law. There must be a certain nearness to the result. It is a question of proximity and degree. Com. v. Peaslee, 177 Mass. 267, 272, 59 N. E. 55. So, as I have said, is the amenability of acts in furtherance of interference with commerce among the states to legislation by Congress. So, according to the intimation of this court, is the question of liability under the present stat- \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 410]\n\u00a0\n ute. Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40; Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 43 L. ed. 300, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. But I assume further, for the purposes of discussion, that what has been done is near enough to the result to fall under the law, if the law prohibits that result, although that assumption very nearly, if not quite, contradicts the decision in United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. But I say that the law does not prohibit the result. If it does it must be because there is some further meaning than I have yet discovered in the words 'combinations in restraint of trade.' I think that I have exhausted the meaning of those words in what I already have said. But they certainly do not require all existing competitions to be kept on foot, and, on the principle of the Trans-Missouri Freight Association's Case, invalidate the continuance of old contracts by which former competitors united in the past.\n A partnership is not a contract or combination in restraint of trade between the partners unless the well known words are to be given a new meaning, invented for the purposes of this act. It is true that the suppression of competition was referred to in United States v. Trans- Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, Sup. Ct. Rep. 540, but, as I have said, that was in connection with a contract with a stranger to the defendant's business,-a true contract in restraint of trade. To suppress competition in that way in one thing; to suppress it by fusion is another. The law, I repeat, says nothing about competition, and only prevents its suppression by contracts or combinations in restraint of trade, and such contracts or combinations derive their character as restraining trade from other features than the suppression of competition alone. To see whether I an wrong, the illustrations put in the argument are of use. If I am, then a partnership between two stage drivers who had been competitors in driving across a state line, or two merchants once engaged in rival commerce among the states, whether made after or before the act, if now continued, is a crime. For, again I repeat, if the restraint on the freedom of the members of a combination, caused by their entering into partnership, is a restraint of \n\n[193 U.S. 197, 411]\n\u00a0\n trade, every such combination, as well the small as the great, is within the act.\n In view of my interpretation of the statute I do not go further into the question of the power of Congress. That has been dealt with by my brother White and I concur, in the main, with his views. I am happy to know that only a minority of my brethren adopt an interpretation of the law which, in my opinion, would make eternal the bellum omnium contra omnes and disintegrate society so far as it could into individual atoms. If that were its intent I should regard calling such a law a regulation of commerce as a mere pretense. It would be an attempt to reconstruct society. I am not concerned with the wisdom of such an attempt, but I believe that Congress was not intrusted by the Constitution with the power to make it, and I am deeply persuaded that it has not tried.\n I am authorized to say that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Peckham concur in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concur Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, Mr. Justice Peckham, and Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n The Northern Securities Company is a New Jersey corporation; the Great Northern Railway Company, a Minnesota one; and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, a Wisconsin corporation. Whilst in the argument at bar the government referred to the subject, nevertheless it expressly disclaimed predicating any claim for relief upon the fact that the predecessor in title of the Northern Pacific Railway Company was a corporation created by act of Congress. That fact, therefore, may be eliminated.\n The facts essential to be borne in mind to understand my point of view, without going into details, are as follows: The lines of the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern Railway Companies are both transcontinental, that is, trunk lines to the Pacfic Ocean,-and in some aspects are conceded to be competing. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hill and a few persons immediately associated with them separately acquired and owned capital stock of the Northern Pacific Railway Company, aggregating a majority thereof. Mr. Hill and others associated with him owned, in the same manner, about onethird of the capital stock of the Great Northern Railway Company, the balance of the stock being distributed among about eighteen hundred stockholders. Although Mr. Hill and his immediate associates owned only one third of the stock, the confidence reposed in Mr. Hill was such that, through proxies, his influence was dominant in the affairs of that company. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

An injunction was prayed restraining the defendant from acting 'in any manner as branch or deputy pilot, or pilot under the laws of the state \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n of Texas, and of said port, or under the laws of the United States, with respect to the kind of vessels specified.' The defendant filed a general demurrer, and, reserving the demurrer, answered, raising special defenses based on averments that the pilotage laws of Texas were in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States. The court overruled the demurrer of the defendant, and, on the ground that no defense was stated, sustained a demurrer to the answer. A judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding an injunction as prayed. (Tex. Civ. App.) 68 S. W. 320. The case was taken to the court of civil appeals for the first supreme judicial district, was thence transferred to the court of civil appeals for the fourth supreme judicial district, where the decree below was affirmed, with a slight modification not necessary to be stated. The supreme court of the state having declined to review the action of the court of civil appeals, this writ of error was prosecuted to the latter court.\n The defenses raised by the answer, which the court below held to be no defense to the action, and which are in effect reiterated in the assignments of error, require us to determine, first, whether the state of Texas had power to enact laws regulating pilotage in the ports of that state; and, second, if such power existed, whether the provisions of the state statutes on that subject are void because they conflict with acts of Congress on the subject of pilotage, and because the statutes of Texas as to pilotage contain provisions of such a character as to cause them to be repugnant to the 14th Amendment or to the laws of Congress forbidding combinations in restraint of trade or commerce. Briefly, the pilotage laws of the state of Texas provide as follows: The governor is authorized to appoint for each port whose population and circumstances shall warrant it, ' a board of five persons of respectable standing, to be known as commissioners of pilotage.' Upon this board power is conferred to fix, within the maximum limits provided by law, the charges to be made by branch and deputy pilots for their services, to regulate the manner \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n in which such pilots shall perform their duty, to examine them as to their qualifications, to hear complaints made against them, and, if occasion requires, to suspend them until the governor shall act in the matter. Upon the governor is conferred the authority to appoint such number of branch pilots as may from time to time be necessary, each of whom shall hold office for two years, subject to removal by the governor at pleasure, and any one who is not a duly commissioned branch pilot or deputy thereof is prohibited from engaging in the business of pilotage so far as the statutes provide for pilotage services by the duly appointed pilots. Revised Statutes of the state of Texas for 1895, articles 3790, 3791, 3792, 3793, 3794, 3796, and 3803. The maximum rates of pilotage are provided for as follows:\n'The rate of pilotage on any class of vessels shall not, in any port of this state, exceed $4 for each foot of water which the vessel, at the time of piloting, draws, and whenever a vessel, except of the classes below excepted, shall decline the services of a pilot, offered outside the bar, and shall enter the port without the aid of one, she shall be liable to the first pilot whose services she so declined, for the payment of half pilotage; and any vessel which, after being brought in by a pilot, shall go out without employing one, shall be liable to the payment of half pilotage to the pilot who brought her in, or, if she has come in without the aid of a pilot, though offered outside, she shall, on so going out, be liable for the payment of half pilotage to the pilot who had first offered his services before she came in; but if she has come in without the aid of a pilot, or the offer of one outside, she shall not, in case of going out without a pilot, be liable to half pilotage. . . .' Article 3800\n\n\n\n The vessels excepted from the operation of the foregoing provisions are thus stated in article 3801:\n'The following classes of vessels shall be free from any charge for pilotage, unless for actual service, to wit: All vessels of twenty tons and under, all vessels of whatsoever burthen \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n owned in the state of Texas, and registered and licensed in the district of Texas, when arriving from or departing to any port of the state of Texas; all vessels of seventy-five tons and under, owned and licensed for the coasting trade in any part of the United States, when arriving from or departing to any port in the state of Texas; all vessels of seventy-five tons or under owned in the state of Texas and licensed for the coasting trade in the district of Texas, when arriving from or departing to any port in the United States.'\n\n The first contention in effect is that the state was without power to legislate concerning pilotage, because any enactment on that subject is necessarily a regulation of commerce within the provision of the Constitution of the United States. The unsoundness of this contention is demonstrated by the previous decisions of this court, since it has long since been settled that even although state laws concerning pilotage are regulations of commerce, 'they fall within that class of powers which may be exercised by the states until Congress has seen fit to act upon the subject.' Cooley v. Port Wardens, 12 How. 299, 13 L. ed. 996; Ex parte McNiel, 13 Wall. 237, 20 L. ed. 624; Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n, 26 L. ed. 234.\n The second proposition relied on is that, albeit the state had power to legislate concerning pilotage until Congress acted, the state laws are void because in conflict with the laws enacted by Congress. This is based upon two provisions of the Revised Statutes of the United States, the one providing that 'no regulations or provisions shall be adopted by any state which shall make any discrimination in the rate of pilotage or half pilotage between vessels sailing between the ports of one state and vessels sailing between the ports of different states, or any discrimination against vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam, or against national vessels of the United States, and all existing regulations or provisions making any such discrimination are annulled and abrogated' (Rev. Stat. 4237, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2903); the other being the provision of the statutes (Rev. Stat. 4444, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3037) exempting coastwise steam vessels from the operation \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n of state pilotage laws. Undoubtedly the exempting clause of the Texas statute is discriminatory, and is therefore void, because in conflict with the law of the United States. The court below so decided. It held, however, that the provisions discriminating in favor of Texas ships and ports were separable from the remainder of the statutes, and therefore the general regulations concerning pilotage were valid, although the discriminating provisions were eliminated. Whether the illegal clauses granting discriminatory exemptions could be eliminated without destroying the other provisions of the state laws regulating pilotage is a state, and not a Federal, question. For the purpose of determining the validity of the statutes in their Federal aspect this court accepts the interpretation given to the statutes by the state court, and tests their validity accordingly. W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 466\n, 45 S. L. ed. 619, 625, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423, and authorities there cited. True it is in Spraigue v. Thompson, \n118 U.S. 90\n, 30 L. ed. 115, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 988, a case involving the pilotage laws of Georgia, in the course of the opinion it was remarked (p. 94, L. ed. p. 116, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 989) that the ruling of the supreme court of the state of Georgia, that the illegal provision of the statute in question was separable, caused the statute 'to enact what confessedly the legislature never meant.' But this remark was not made the basis of the conclusion, since it was decided in that case that the pilotage charge in question was invalid, even under the construction given by the supreme court of the state of Georgia to the state statute, because the exaction which was in controversy was in conflict with the provisions of the Revised Statutes of the United States, exempting coastwise steam vessels from pilotage charges. In any event, it is apparent that the observation referred to, made in the case of Spraigue v. Thompson, has been qualified by the later decisions of this court to which we have previously referred.\n Of course, whilst accepting the construction of the state court as to the divisibility of the statute, the duty yet remains, for the purpose of the Federal question, to determine whether the statute as construed is valid. As the effect of \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 343]\n\u00a0\n the construction below was to eliminate the discrimination from the statute, it is clear, in view of the power of the state to legislate concerning pilotage until Congress acts upon the subject, that the statutes, as interpreted below, were within the power of the state, and not in conflict with any act of Congress. Indeed, it is obvious from the provisions of the Revised Statutes ( 4237, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2903) forbidding discrimination in state legislation concerning pilotage, that Congress did not intend by that section to revoke the power of the states on the subject, or to abrogate existing pilotage laws of the several states, containing discriminatory provisions, but only to abrogate the provisions making the discrimination. This results since the statute, after first generally prohibiting regulations by any state discriminating 'in the rate of pilotage or half pilotage between vessels sailing between the ports of one state and vessels sailing between the ports of different states, or any discrimination against vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam, or against national vessels of the United States,' in careful language annuls and abrogates only 'all existing regulations or provisions making any such discrimination.' And this construction of the section in question disposes also of the argument that, if the statute be accepted as interpreted by the state court, it is nevertheless repugnant to the law of the United States, since, if the exceptions found in the state statute are eliminated, then those statutes impose pilotage charges upon all vessels, and hence subject coastwise steam vessels of the United States to such charges, although they are expressly exempted therefrom. Rev. Stat.  4444, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3037. But the provisions of that section clearly contemplated that, by the existing state laws, coastwise steam vessels of the United States were subject to pilotage charges, and proposed, whilst withdrawing such vessels from pilotage charges, not in other respects to interfere with the state laws on the subject of pilotage. This is plainly the result of the following provision contained in the section in question:\n'Nothing in this title shall be construed to annul or affect \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 344]\n\u00a0\n any regulation established by the laws of any state, requiring vessels entering or leaving a port in any such state, other than coastwise steam vessels, to take a pilot duly licensed or authorized by the laws of such state.'\n\n Nor is there merit in the contention that, as the vessel in question was a British vessel, coming from a foreign port, the state laws concerning pilotage are in conflict with a treaty between Great Britain and the United States, providing that 'no higher or other duties or charges shall be imposed in any of the ports of the United States on British vessels than those payable in the same ports by vessels of the United States.' [8 Stat. at L. 229, art. 2] Neither the exemption of coastwise steam vessels from pilotage, resulting from the law of the United States, nor any lawful exemption of coastwise vessels, created by the state law, concerns vessels in the foreign trade, and, therefore, any such exemptions do not operate to produce a discrimination against British vessels engaged in foreign trade, and in favor of vessels of the United States in such trade. In substance the proposition but asserts that, because, by the law of the United States, steam vessels in the coastwise trade have been exempt from pilotage regulations, therefore there is no power to subject vessels in foreign trade to pilotage regulations, even although such regulations apply, without discrimination, to all vessels engaged in such foreign trade, whether domestic or foreign.\n It remains only to consider the contentions based upon the 14th Amendment and the anti-trust laws of Congress. The argument is, that the right of a person who is competent to perform pilotage services to render them is an inherent right, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and that therefore all state regulations providing for the appointment of pilots, and restricting the right to pilot to those duly appointed, are repugnant to the 14th Amendment. But this proposition in its essence simply denies that pilotage is subject to governmental control, and therefore is foreclosed by the adjudications to which we have previously referred. The contention that (because) the commissioned pilots have a \n\n[195 U.S. 332, 345]\n\u00a0\n monopoly of the business, and by combination among themselves exclude all others from rendering pilotage services, is also but a denial of the authority of the state to regulate, since, if the state has the power to regulate, and in so doing to appoint and commission those who are to perform pilotage services, it must follow that no monopoly or combination in a legal sense can arise from the fact that the duly authorized agents of the state are alone allowed to perform the duties devolving upon them by law. When the propositions just referred to are considered in their ultimate aspect they amount simply to the contention, not that the Texas laws are void for want of power, but that they are unwise. If an analysis of those laws justified such conclusion,-which we do not at all imply is the case,-the remedy is in Congress, in whom the ultimate authority on the subject is vested, and cannot be judicially afforded by denying the power of the state to exercise its authority over a subject concerning which it has plenary power until Congress had seen fit to act in the premises.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC ELECTRIC R CO v.

The advertisement must be in some newspaper published in the municipality wherein the franchise is to be exercised, and must state that bids will be received for such franchise, and that it will be awarded to the highest bidder. The advertisement must state a number of other matters, but, as no point is made upon them, they are omitted.\n In pursuance of the statute appellant made application to the council of the city of Los Angeles for an electric street railroad franchise. The application was referred to the board of public works, which board recommended the franchise be offered for sale. The report was adopted by the council and the franchise was offered for sale, and notice thereof was given as required by the statute. The notice given was very full and circumstantial, but its contents are immaterial to the views we take of the case.\n Bids were received by the council on the 10th of February, 1902. Appellant bid $25,000; W. S. Hook, who, it is alleged, was president of the Los Angeles Traction Company, bid $37,500; E. A. Davis, one of the appellees, bid $139,000, and E. Murray bid $415,000. There were no other bids.\n Section 5 of the act of 1901 provides that at the time of opening of the bids any responsible sponsible firm or corporation present \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n or represented may bid for the franchise or privilege a sum not less than 10 per cent above the highest sealed bid therefor, and said bid so made may be raised 10 per cent by any responsible bidder present, and said franchise or privilege finally be struck off, sold, and granted by said governing body to the highest bidder therefor, in gold coin of the United States, who shall deposit with the 'governing body,' or such person as it shall direct, the amount bid within twenty-four hours thereafter. In case of failure to do so 'then the said franchise or privilege shall be granted to the next highest bidder therefor.'\n No person raising the bid E. Murray, in accordance with  5, his bid was accepted, and it was ordered that said franchise be struck off and sold to said Murray, and the city treasurer was ordered and directed to receive the money therefor. It was further ordered that the period of twenty-four hours within which he was allowed to pay for the franchise should expire at 3.15 P. M. on February 11, 1902\n\n\n The bids of Hook, Davis, and Murray were all made on behalf of the Los Angeles Traction Company and for its benefit, and with the fraudulent intent of preventing competition and further bidding when the bids should be open, well knowing that the franchise was not worth the sum of $415,000 and that no advance on the same was to be made. And it is alleged that Murray has no financial standing, never intended to pay his bid, and did not pay the same or offer to pay the same within the time allowed, and never appeared again before the council.\n On the 11th of February the traction company and Davis and Hook appeared before the council, and, in pursuance of their fraudulent scheme, claimed that the council had no authority or power to do any other thing than to accept the bid of Davis for $139,000, and demanded that the said franchise be awarded to him. Such proceedings were had that the council declared the bid of Murray to be fraudulent and void, and the matter of the sale of the franchise was again taken up. Appellant thereupon bid the sum of $152,000, and presented \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n with its bid a certificate of deposit on one of the banks in the city, drawn in the name of the city for said sum. Bids over and above said bid were called for by the council, but none was received, and the franchise was ordered to be sold and struck off to appellant. The treasurer was also directed to receive the purchase money, which was paid by appellant in United States gold coin, and it was accepted by the treasurer and the council. Appellant executed a bond in the sum of $25,000 as required by the statute, and the franchise was thereupon struck off, sold, and granted to appellant. Subsequently the council passed an ordinance granting the said franchise to appellant, and presented the same to the mayor of the city, who returned the same to the council without his signature or approval, and with his objections to the same. On the 21st of February the question came up before the council for the passage of the ordinance, notwithstanding the veto of the mayor. The ordinance was not passed, but the council passed a resolution pretending and purporting to order any and all bids to be rejected, and ordered the treasurer of the city to refund to appellant the money paid, and the clerk to return the bond executed and filed by appellant-all of which was done by the council under the pretense that the approval of the mayor to the ordinance passed, as above stated, was necessary to give it validity or to make effectual the grant made by the city of the franchise to appellant.\n It is alleged that the council of the city, under the statute of the state, had no discretion as to the bid of appellant, but were, on the contrary, by the operation of said statute, ordered to strike off, sell, and grant the franchise to appellant, and no ordinance was necessary to perfect the grant, and the mayor was not authorized to perform any function in, about, or concerning said franchise, and his veto was wholly unfounded; and the title of the appellant became fully vested under the statute, and there was no power in the mayor or the council, or in both, to in any manner affect the rights which had accrued to appellant by virtue of its franchise. \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n That appellant had become vested with the title to the franchise, and the orders and resolution of the council, pretending to reconsider the order granting the franchise as above stated, and readvertising the application, were made without any authority, and were intended to deprive appellant of its said property without due process of law, in violation of the provision of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting any state from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n That under the statute, notice of sale, and order granting the franchise, appellant was required to commence work for the construction of the road within four months from the 11th of February, 1902, and complete the same within three years from that date. That appellant was and is desirous of commencing such construction, but on the 26th of February, 1902, the council passed an order instructing the mayor, the street superintendent, and the chief of police to stop and prevent any attempt appellant might make to construct said road upon any of the streets with all the force at their command, and said officers, acting under such instructions, will undertake by violence to prevent appellant from constructing said road or exercising any rights under its franchise, or for any enjoyment of its property so acquired unless prevented by the court (circuit court).\n That if the city should sell said franchise, rights, and privileges again it will aid the purchaser, with the police force of the city, to take possession of the city property, rights, and franchises, and construct a road over and along said route, and to oust and exclude appellant therefrom, and appellant will be compelled to resort to a mutiplicity of suits to protect and defend its rights, privileges, and franchise purchased by it, and its right to exercise and enjoy the same, and appellant will suffer great and irreparable damage, which cannot be compensated in money.\n The relief prayed is that appellant be declared the owner in fee simple of the rights and franchise described; that the orders \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n of the council, reconsidering the order selling and granting the same, and all of the proceedings of the council subsequent thereto, be rescinded and vacated, and the appellees be restrained from preventing appellant from constructing the road and exercising the rights, privileges, and franchise granted.\n The city of Los Angeles and the appellees composing its council demurred to the bill. The other appellees also demurred, and the grounds of demurrer, were among others, that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, and the bill was without equity. The circuit court overruled the demurrers on the first ground and sustained them on the second. 118 Fed. 747.\n Mr. J. S. Chapman and Messrs. Bicknell, Gibson, & Trask, Hunsaker & Britt, Works & Lee, and Dunn & Crutcher for appellant.\n Messrs. W. B. Mathews and Jonathan R. Scott for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The jurisdictional question first demands consideration. It will be observed that rights under the 14th Amndment of the rights under the 14th Amendment of the asserted. Besides, the circuit court treated the bill also as presenting for consideration rights under the contract clause of the Constitution, and entertained jurisdiction of the case on the authority of Riverside & A. R. Co. v. Riverside, 118 Fed. 736.\n In City Railway Co. v. Citizens' Street R. Co. \n166 U.S. 557\n, 41 L. ed 1114, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653, the railroad company occupied certain streets of the city of Indianapolis under ordinances of the city. Subsequently the city, in pursuance of an act of the general assembly of the state, gave the city railway permission to lay its tracks on some of the same streets which were occupied by the railroad company. The latter brought suit in the circuit court of the \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n United States for the district of Indiana against the railway company, to enjoin it from availing itself of the privilege attempted to be granted. The court granted the relief prayed for and the case was brought here directly. A question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court was raised, and, replying to it, we said: 'All that is necessary to establish the jurisdiction of the court is to show that the complainant had, or claimed in good faith to have, a contract with the city, which the latter had attempted to impair.' And it was further observed whether the contract was or was not impaired could not be passed upon 'on the motion to dismiss so long as the complainant claimed in its bill that it had that effect, and such claim was apparently made in good faith, and was not a frivolous one.' This view was repeated in Illinois C. R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 U.S. 28\n, 45 L. ed. 410, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 251.\n In those cases the question of jurisdiction was presented on motion to dismiss. In the case at bar it is presented by demurrer; but, however presented, jurisdiction depends primarily upon the allegations of the bill, not upon the facts as they may subsequently turn out. City Railway Co. v. Citizens' Street R. Co. \n166 U.S. 557\n, 41 L. 1114, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653. Nor upon the actual sufficiency, in the opinion of the court, of the facts alleged to justify the relief prayed for. We do not mean, however, that a mere claim in words is sufficient-a substantial controversy must be presented. This requirement is satisfied in the case at bar. The circuit court, therefore, had jurisdiction, and the case was properly brought here from that court, since it involves the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States.\n 2d. The claim of appellant is that the order of the city council of the 11th of February, 1902, granting the franchise to it, appellant, constituted a contract, the obligation of which the subsequent orders of the council impaired, and, further, deprived appellant of its property without due process of law. The question upon which the claim depends is, in our view, a simple one. We need not quote the provision of the statute applicable to the contentions of the appellees, that the notice \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n given of the sale of the franchise was insufficient, nor need we discuss that contention or the contention that the approval of the mayor of the city under the charter of the city and the Constitution of the state was necessary to a grant of franchises. We will assume the contentions are untenable, and we will also assume that all the steps preliminary to the bidding were rightfully taken, and that the order of the council striking off and selling to appellant the franchise was sufficient to vest title in appellant if its bid was properly and legally accepted under  5 of the act of 1901. This narrows the question in the case to the construction of that section.\n The notice of an application for a franchise is required to state that sealed bids will be received for the franchise 'up to a certain hour and day named therein' ( 3), and also to state that the franchise 'will be granted to the person, firm, or corporation who shall make the highest cash bid therefor;' and any bid may be raised not less than 10 per cent 'above the highest sealed bid,' and the franchise finally struck off, sold, and granted to the 'highest bidder.' ( 5). Section 5 also provides that the 'successful bidder shall deposit with said governing body, or such person as it may direct, the full amount of his or its bid, within twenty- four hours thereafter; and in case he or it shall fail so to do, then the said franchise or privilege shall be granted to the next highest bidder therefor.' We italicize the pivotal words. To what do they refer? To bids already made, as contended by appellees, or to a bid or bids to be made, as contended by appellant? More obviously the former. They express the relation between bids in existence,-those already made and pending before the council in pursuance of its notice. It is only in comparison with the next highest of those that the words have signification.\n But this construction, it is said, permits the fraud which the bill alleges was practised upon the city council. We cannot say the argument is without force, but that fraud might be attempted may have been considered and weighed by the legislature. It may have been thought that in any plan of \n\n[194 U.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n competition which could be devised there would be danger of illegal combinations, and that the safeguard against them must be the vigilance of the municipal officers, and, may be, that of competing interests. But be this as it may, the defects of the statute cannot control its plain letter. Obviously, to give them such effect would be to amend the statute, not to interpret it. And we think  5 is plain, and was intended to express as an alternative of a bid not fulfilled the acceptance of one already made, not one to be made. We are fortified in this view by  7 of the act. That section provides that the grantee of the franchise shall file a bond to fulfil the terms and conditions of such franchise, and also provides that if such bond be not filed 'the award of such franchise shall be set aside and the same may be granted to the next lowest bidder, or again offered for sale,' in discretion of the governing body. In other words, when there is to be further competition it is explicitly provided for.\n It follows that appellant's bid was not the next highest to that of Murray, and the order of the council selling and granting appellant the franchise was void, and the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATTERSON v. HEWITT(1904)\nNo. 23\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n Appellants C. Ewing Patterson, a resident of New Jersey, and Henry J. Patterson, a resident of New Mexico, on April 29, \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 310]\n\u00a0\n 1903, filed their bill of complaint in the district court for Lincoln county, territory of New Mexico, against John Y. Hewitt, William Watson, Mathew Hoyle, and Harvey B. Fergusson, residents of New Mexico, and the Old Abe Company, a corporation of the same territory, to enforce a trust which is alleged to have existed between the appellants and the defendant Hewitt, and by virtue of which they sought to recover a one-fourth interest in two mining locations, made in the name of John Y. Hewitt, on the 2d day of May 1884. The bill prayed for an accounting of proceeds of ores taken from the mines, and a lien on the property, for an injunction, and the appointment of a receiver.\n The facts in the case as found by the district court and adopted by the supreme court are substantially as follows:\n In 1881 the property in controversy was claimed by the appellants and by Watson, one of the defendants, under locations previously made by them. Between 1881 and 1883, appellants, in conjunction with the defendant Watson, did a large amount of work upon the claims, and were asserting their rights under the mining laws of the United States. During this time the same ground was also claimed by other parties, among whom was the defendant Hewitt. In August, 1883, a dispute arose in regard to this property between appellants and the defendant Watson on one side and the other parties upon the other side.\n The parties interested held a meeting in August or September, 1883, for the purpose of adjusting the differences then existing between them, and to endeavor, if possible, to arrive at an agreement whereby the interests of all would be protected. The two appellants, the defendant Watson and the defendant Hewitt, with several others who were interested, attended this meeting. The result was an agreement between them that all the old locations then existing, whether made by the appellants or any of the defendants, or conflicting claimants, should be from that date abandoned, surrendered, and given up by all of the parties, and that the ground should be \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 311]\n\u00a0\n put in possession of Hewitt, as trustee, to hold in his own name for the benefit of all the parties then interested. It was also agreed that Hewitt, as such trustee, should make a deed to such of the said parties holding interests therein as should contribute their part to the work, labor, and expenses necessary to obtain a patent to the land; but there was no agreement as to what should become of the interests of any one who failed to contribute his share of the expenses. It was also agreed that each of the appellants contributing his share of the expenses should receive a one- eighth interest in the location, and that the said Watson and Hewitt should each receive a one-eighth interest, part on account of their services and part on account of their interests in the ground, and that the remaining shares should go to other parties who were interested therein.\n In pursuance of this agreement Hewitt took charge of the property, and together with the defendant Watson and one of the appellants Patterson, superintended and directed the work upon said mine during the year 1883 and part of the year 1884. In order to raise money for the working of the mine it was agreed that a one-sixth interest should be sold to H. B. Fergusson for $500.\n During 1884 and 1885 a sufficient amount of work was done upon the property to obtain a patent, and to discover mineral thereon. The appellants contributed their share of the work, which enabled the trustee to obtain a patent, and so far carried out their part of the agreement as to entitle them to a deed from the trustee for their one-eighth interest each, according to said agreement.\n In April, 1885, the appellant Henry J. Patterson, in person and by his agent, demanded a deed from Hewitt, trustee, of the one-eighth interest to which he claimed to be entitled; but the defendant Hewitt at that time refused to make the said deed, and has ever since refused to execute the same, and has disputed his right thereto.\n No demand for a deed appears to have been made by C. \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 312]\n\u00a0\n Ewing Patterson until just before the commencement of this suit, when it was also refused.\n In 1883, the complainant C. Ewing Patterson left New Mexico, and, up to the time of the bringing of this suit, had never returned there. The appellant Henry J. Patterson left in 1885, and from that time until the fall of 1892 was a nonresident of New Mexico.\n From 1885 to 1890 the defendants performed a large amount of work and expended a good deal of money on the mine in addition to the annual assessment required by the government of the United States thereon; but neither of the appellants ever contributed or offered to contribute any part of the expenses of said work, or perform any labor.\n In November, 1890, the defendants discovered a large body of rich ore in the mine, and since that date have taken out therefrom gold amounting to several hundred thousand dollars. In 1892, a corporation known as the Old Abe Mining Company was organized by the defendants Hewitt, Fergusson, Watson, and others, and the ground in controversy, known as the Old Abe ground, including the interests claimed by the appellants, was turned over to the new corporation by the trustee, Hewitt, and this corporation is now holding title thereto.\n The appellant Henry J. Patterson, through his agent, Henry Burgess, had knowledge from April, 1885, that Hewitt had refused to carry out said agreement, and execute the deed to him and his co-complainant, and both of the appellants were again informed after April, 1885, that Hewitt had refused to make the said deeds or to carry out the trust agreement.\n Upon this state of facts the district court dismissed the bill upon the ground of laches. The supreme court of the territory affirmed its action (55 L. R. A. 658, 66 Pac. 553), and complainants appealed to this court.\n W. B. Childers and F. W. Clancy for appellants.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 309, 314]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. B. Fergusson for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 309, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defense of laches, which prompted the dismissal of the bill in this case, has so often been made the subject of discussion in this court that a citation of cases is quite unnecessary. Some degree of diligence in bringing suit is required under all systems of jurisprudence. In actions at law, the question of diligence is determined by the words of the statute. If an action be brought the day before the statutory time expires, it will be sustained; if the day after, it will be defeated. In suits in equity the question is determined by the circumstances of each particular case. The statute of limitations consorts with the rigid principles of the common law, but is ill adapted to the flexible remedies of a court of equity. The statute frequently works great practical injustice,-the doctrine of laches, never. True, lapse of time is one of the chief ingredients, but there are others of almost equal importance. Change in the value of the property between the time the cause of action arose and the time the bill was filed, complainant's knowledge or ignorance of the facts constituting the cause of action, as well as his diligence in availing himself of the means \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 318]\n\u00a0\n of knowledge within his control,-are all material to be considered upon the question whether the suit was brought without unreasonable delay.\n\n 1. \nIn the case under consideration the appellants claim the benefit of  2938 of the Compiled Laws of New Mexico, to the following effect:\n'No person or persons, nor their children or heirs, shall have, sue, or maintain any action or suit, either in law or equity, for any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, but within ten years next after his, her, or their right to commence, have, or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen, or accrued.' etc.\n\n If this were an action of ejectment at law, there seems to be no question but what it could be maintained, since it was brought within ten years from the time the cause of action accrued; but where the statute is in terms applicable to suits in equity, as well as at law, it is ordinrily construed, in cases demanding equitable relief, as fixing a time beyond which the suit will not, under any circumstances, lie; but not as precluding the defense of laches, provided there has been unreasonable delay within the time limited by the statute. In an action at law, courts are bound by the literalism of the statute; but in equity the question of unreasonable delay within the statutory limitation is still open. Alsop v. Riker, \n155 U.S. 448\n-460, 39 L. ed. 218-222, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162.\n If this were not so, it would seem to follow that in the code states, where there is but one form of action applicable both to proceedings of a legal and equitable nature, a statute of limitations, general in its terms, would apply to suits of both descriptions, and the doctrine of the laches become practically obsolete. This, however, is far from being the case, as questions of laches are as often arising and being discussed in the code states as in the others. In a few cases where the statute of limitations is made applicable in terms to suits in equity, it has been construed as allowing a suit to be begun at any time within the period limited by the statute, notwithstanding the intermediate laches of the complainant, although in those \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 319]\n\u00a0\n cases it will usually be found that the language of the statute is explicit and imperative. Hill v. Nash, 73 Miss. 849, 19 So. 709; Washington v. Soria, 73 Miss. 665, 55 Am. St. Rep. 555, 19 So. 485.\n But the weight of authority is the other way, and we consider the better rule to be that, even if the statute of limitations be made applicable, in general terms to suits in equity, and not to any particular defense, the defendant may avail himself of the laches of the complainant, notwithstanding the time fixed by the statute has not expired. This has been expressly held in Alabama (Scruggs v. Decatur Mineral & Land Co. 86 Ala. 173, 5 So. 440), in Missouri (Bliss v. Prichard, 67 Mo. 181; Kline v. Vogel, 90 Mo. 239, 1 S. W. 733, 2 S. W. 408), and in New York (Calhoun v. Millard, 121 N. Y. 69, 8 L. R. A. 248, 24 N. E. 27). In the last case the question is discussed at considerable length by Chief Judge Andrews, and the conclusion reached that 'the period of limitation of equitable actions fixed by the statute is not, where a purely equitable remedy is invoked, equivalent to a legislative direction that no period short of that time shall be a bar to relief in any case, or precludes the court from denying relief in accordance with equitable principles for unreasonable delay, although the full period of ten years has not elapsed since the cause of action accrued.'\n Indeed, in some cases the diligence required is measured by months rather than by years. Pollard v. Clayton, 1 Kay & J. 462; Attwood v. Small, 6 Clark & F. 356.\n And in others a delay of two, three, or four years has been held fatal. Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, \n91 U.S. 587\n, 23 L. ed. 329; Hayward v. Eliot Nat. Bank, \n96 U.S. 611\n, 24 L. ed. 855; Holgate v. Eaton, \n116 U.S. 33\n, 29 L. ed. 538, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224; Hagerman v. Bates, 5 Colo. App. 391, 38 Pac. 1100; Graff v. Portland Town & Mineral Co. 12 Colo. App. 106, 54 Pac. 854.\n\n 2. \nThe facts in this case, so far as they concern the applicability of the defense of laches, are that all prior locations made by the claimants to this land were abandoned in August, 1883, when an oral agreement was entered into that Hewitt should be appointed trustee for all concerned; that upon the performance of certain conditions by the parties interested he \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 320]\n\u00a0\n should make a deed to each of such parties as should contribute his part to the work and expense necessary to obtain a patent; that each of the appellants contributed his share of the work in the years 1883 and 1884,- enough to entitle each of them to a deed of his interest under the agreement; that April, 1885, Henry J. Patterson demanded a deed of Hewitt, which was refused, but that C. Ewing Patterson did not demand his deed until just before the institution of this suit; that the defendants and their associates, from the year 1885 to 1890, performed a large amount of work in developing the mine, to which neither of the appellants contributed any part; that in November, 1890, a large body of rich ore was discovered, and since that time gold to the amount of several hundred thousand dollars has been taken out. Both of the appellants left the territory of New Mexico during the year 1885, and resided abroad up to the time of the beginning of this suit. Both were aware that Hewitt had refused to deed them their interest in the mine and in the patent which he, in the meantime, had obtained to the property.\n It thus appears that the right of action accrued to the appellants in April, 1885, and that this suit was not begun until eight years thereafter,- in 1893. Whether the refusal of Hewitt to make the deeds was right or wrong is not material here. There is no doubt from the findings that appellants had no share in the subsequent development of the mine or the discovery of ore in 1890, and that it was through the efforts and perseverance of the defendants, and the aid they received from Fergusson, that they were put in possession of this valuable property. If appellants had expected a share in this property they should either have brought a bill promptly to enforce their rights, or at least contributed their proportionate share to the subsequent work and labor, and the expenses then incurred. To award them now a deed to their original interest in the property would be grossly unjust to the defendants, through whose exertions the value of the property was discovered and the mine put upon a paying basis. While \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 321]\n\u00a0\n it is true the court might impose upon the appellants the payment of their proportionate share of labor and expenses as a condition of relief, it could not compensate the defendants for the risk assumed by them that their exertions would come to nought. There is no class of property more subject to sudden and violent fluctuations of value than mining lands. A location which to-day may have no salable value may in a month become worth its millions. Years may be spent in working such property, apparently to no purpose, when suddenly a mass of rich ore may be discovered, from which an immense fortune is realized. Under such circumstances, persons having claims to such property are bound to the utmost diligence in enforcing them, and there is no class of cases in which the doctrine of laches has been more relentlessly enforced.\n\n 3. \nBut little need be said in reply to appellants' argument that a trust relation was established between these parties by the oral agreement of 1883, under which Hewitt was to take possession, hold the property for the benefit of all concerned, and ultimately to convey to each his proportionats share. In this connection it is sought to apply the familiar rule that neither laches nor the statute of limitations is applicable against an express trust, so long as that trust continues. Conceding all that can be claimed as to the existence of an express parol trust in this case, the refusal of Hewitt to execute the deed to H. J. Patterson of his interest in the property, of which both appellants had notice, was a distinct repudiation of such trust, which entitled the complainants to immediate relief, and opened the door to the defense of laches. Speidel v. Henrici, \n120 U.S. 377\n-386, 30 L. ed. 718, 719, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 610; Riddle v. Whitehill, \n135 U.S. 621\n-634, 34 L. ed. 283-287, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 924.\n The supreme court of the territory also found that the case was within  2916 of the Compiled Laws of the territory, requiring that all actions founded upon 'unwritten contracts . . . or for relief upon the ground of fraud, and all other actions not herein otherwise provided for and specified,' shall be brought within four years; and that this defense was not \n\n[195 U.S. 309, 322]\n\u00a0\n answered by  2930, declaring that 'none of the provisions of this act shall run against causes of action originating in or arising out of trusts, when the defendant has fraudulently concealed the cause of action, or the existence thereof, from the party entitled or having the right thereto.' As there was no evidence that the defendants had fraudulently concealed the facts from the appellants, and abundant proof that the facts were known to them, the latter section was held not to apply. While the case does not necessarily involve it, we see no reason to question the correctness of the court's conclusion on this point.\n We are clearly of the opinion that the delay of eight years in this case was inexcusable, and the decree of the court below must, therefore, be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL PENNSYLVANIA R CO v. KNIGHT(1904)\nNo. 91\nArgued: December 11, 1903Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the state of New York to review a judgment of that court affirming the \n\n[192 U.S. 21, 22]\n\u00a0\n assessment by the comptro1a26ller of the state of New York of a certain tax against the relator, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The contention of the plaintiff in error is that the tax, which is a franchise tax imposed under appropriate statutes of New York upon the company for carrying on the business of running cabs and carriages for hire between points entirely within the state of New York, is invalid under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, article I.,  8, subdivision 3.\n The facts are undisputed. In 1897 the company established a cab stand on its own premises at the Twenty-third street ferry in the city of New York, and has since maintained a service of cabs and coaches under special licenses from the city of New York, whereby they can stand on those premises only. The sole business done by those cabs and coaches is to bring the company's passengers to and from the Twenty-third street ferry. The charges for this service are separate from those of the company for further transportation, and no part of its receipts from the cab service is received as compensation for any service outside the state of New York. As a separate business, this cab service has not been profitable to the company, but has been operated at a loss. The validity of this tax was sustained both by the supreme court and the court of appeals of New York. 67 App. Div. 398, 73 N. Y. Supp. 790, 171 N. Y. 354, 64 N. E. 152.\n Messrs. Henry Galbraith Ward, A, Leo Everett, and Robinson, Biddle, & Ward for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 21, 25]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Cunneen for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention of the company is that this cab service is merely an extension, and therefore a part of, its interstate transportation; that it is not carrying on a cab business generally in the city of New York, but is merely furnishing the service to those who seek to take over its lines some interstate transportation, thus commencing the transportation from their houses instead of from the ferry landing, or like service to those who have already received such interstate transportation, thus completing the transportation to their places of destination; that the character of the business remains unchanged, although individuals may avail themselves of this service who do not intend or have not received any interstate transportation, for they who thus use the service do so wrongfully and against the wish of the company. In other words, the company, to promote its general business, seeks only to complete the continuous transportation of interstate passengers to or from their residences or hotels in New York city instead of commencing and ending such transportation at the ferry landing at Twenty-third street; the character of the service depends not on the action of the passenger, but on the purpose of the company in providing it, and the omission to include the charge for the cab service in the charges for other transportation arises from the practical difficulty of making such inclusion, and does not alter the fact that such cab service is a part of the interstate transportation. \n\n[192 U.S. 21, 26]\n\u00a0\n To hold the even balance between the nation and the states in the exercise of their respective powers and rights, always difficult, is becoming more so through the growing complexity of social life and business conditions. Into many relations and transactions there enter elements of a national as well as those of a state character, and to determine in a given case which elements dominate, and assign the relation or transaction to the control of the nation or of the state, is often most perplexing. And this case fully illustrates the perplexities.\n It is true that a passenger over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the city of New York does not, in one sense, fully complete his journey when he reaches the ferry landing on the New York side, but only when he is delivered at his temporary or permanent stopping place in the city. Looking at it from this standpoint, the company's cab service is simply one element in a continuous interstate transportation, and as such would be excluded from state, and be subject to national, control. The state may not tax for the privilege of doing an interstate commerce business. Atlantic & P Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 95, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817. On the other hand, the cab service is exclusively rendered within the limits of the city. It is contracted and paid for independently of any contract or payment for strictly interstate transportation. The party receiving it owes no legal duty of crossing the state line.\n Undoubtedly, a single act of carriage or transportation wholly within a state may be part of a continuous interstate carriage or transportation. Goods shipped from Albany to Philadelphia may be carried by the New York Central Railroad only within the limits of New York, and yet that service is in interstate carriage. By reason thereof the nation regulates that carriage, including the part performed by the New York company. But it does not follow therefrom that the New York company is wholly relieved from state regulation and state taxation, for a part of its work is carriage and transportation begun and ended within the state. So the Pennsylvania company, which is engaged largely in interstate \n\n[192 U.S. 21, 27]\n\u00a0\n transportation, is amenable to state regulation and state taxation as to any of its service which is wholly performed within the state, and not as a part of interstate transportation. Wherever a separation in fact exists between transportation service wholly within the state and that between the states, a like separation may be recognized between the control of the state and that of the nation. Osborne v. Florida, \n164 U.S. 650\n, 41 L. ed. 586, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214; Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n, 47 L. ed. 877, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494.\n As we have seen, the cab service is rendered wholly within the state, and has no contractual or necessary relation to interstate transportation. It is either preliminary or subsequent thereto. It is independently contracted for, and not necessarily connected therewith. But when service is wholly within a state, it is presumably subject to state control. The burden is on him who asserts that, though actually within, it is legally outside, the state; and unless the interstate character is established, locality determines the question of jurisdiction. Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, though not in all respects similar, is very closely in point. In that case spruce logs had been drawn down from Wentworth's Location in New Hampshire, and placed in Clear Stream, also in New Hampshire, to be from thence floated down the Androscoggin river to the state of Maine, there to be manufactured and sold. After they had thus been drawn down and placed in Clear Stream, a tax was imposed upon them by the state of New Hampshire. The validity of that tax was challenged on the ground that the logs were in process of transportation from Wentworth's Location in New Hampshire to the state of Maine. It was sustained by the supreme court of New Hampshire, and also by this court. In the course of the opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley are these pertinent observations (p. 528, L. ed. p. 719, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 479):\n'It is true, it was said in the case of The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 565, 19 L. ed. 999, 1002: 'Whenever a commodity has begun to move as an article of trade from one state to another, commerce in that commodity between the states has commenced.' But this movement does not begin until the articles have been \n\n[192 U.S. 21, 28]\n\u00a0\n shipped or started for transportation from the one state to the other. The carrying of them in carts or other vehicles, or even floating them, to the depot where the journey is to commence, is no part of that journey. That is all preliminary work, performed for the purpose of putting the property in a state of preparation and readiness for transportation. Until actually launched on its way to another state, or committed to a common carrier for transportation to such state, its destination is not fixed and certain. It may be sold or otherwise disposed of within the state, and never put in course of transportation out of the state. Carrying it from the farm, or the forest, to the depot, is only an interior movement of the property, entirely within the state, for the purpose, it is true, but only for the purpose, of putting it into a course of exportation; it is no part of the exportation itself. Until shipped or started on its final journey out of the state its exportation is a matter altogether in fieri, and not at all a fixed and certain thing.'\n\n Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 U.S. 82\n, 47 L. ed. 394, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266; Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 21 C. C. A. 103, 43 U. S. App. 308, 74 Fed. 803, \n167 U.S. 633\n, 42 L. ed. 306, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986.\n As shown in the opinion from which we have just quoted, many things have more or less close relation to interstate commerce which are not properly to be regarded as a part of it. If the cab which carries the passengers from the hotel to the ferry landing is engaged in interstate transportation, why is not the porter who carries the traveler's trunk from his room to the carriage also so engaged? If the cab service is interstate transportation, are the drivers of the cabs and the dealers who supply hay and grain for the horses also engaged in interstate commerce? And where will the limit be placed?\n We are of opinion that the cab service is an independent local service, preliminary or subsequent to any interstate transportation, and therefore the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York was correct, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE'S GAS LIGHT & COKE CO v. CITY OF CHICAGO(1904)\nNo. 132\nArgued: January 20, 1904Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. William D. Guthrie, James F. Meagher, and William F. Sheehan for appellants.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Granville W. Browning and Edgar Bronson Tolman for appellee. \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a bill to restrain the city of Chicago from putting in force a general ordinance passed October 15, 1900, providing that corporations, companies, or persons manufacturing, selling, and distributing gas in the city of Chicago for illuminating or fuel purposes should not charge individual consumers more than 75 cents per thousand cubic feet, and providing \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n penalties for violation of its provisions. The bill was demurred to, and an opinion delivered on hearing on demurrer. 114 Fed. 384.\n The opinion took a wider range than the bill as framed called for, because of certain facts not therein set forth, but which were admitted on the argument, and accordingly it was suggested that the bill be amended to bring in these facts, and, this having been done, the demurrer was renewed to the amended bill, whereupon, after argument, the court gave an additional brief opinion (which appears in the record), sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, as amended, for want of jurisdiction. Subsequently it was stipulated and agreed by and between the parties that the decree as entered did not correctly recite what was intended by the court, and that it should be amended by striking out the words 'for want of jurisdiction,' and inserting in lieu thereof the words 'upon the merits as to the alleged contract rights of the complainant, but without prejudice to any other suit in respect to the question of power of the city council under the laws of the state of Illinois.' An order was then entered by the court, amending its previous decree nunc pro tunc in the particulars named.\n The facts presented by the amended bill were these: The People's Gaslight & Coke Company was incorporated by a special act of the general assembly of Illinois, approved February 12, 1855, creating it a corporation, with the usual powers and liabilities, with a capital stock not to exceed $500,000, and with power to manufacture and sell gas in the city of Chicago and 'to lay pipes for the purpose of conducting the gas in any of the streets or avenues of said city, with the consent of the city council,' and by the 4th section it was expressly provided that the company should furnish and supply to the city, for its public uses, at the election of the proper authorities of the city, 'a sufficient supply of gas, at a rate not exceeding $2 per thousand feet, and the inhabitants of said city at a rate not exceeding $2.50 per thousand feet.' The city council passed an ordinance, August 30, 1858, \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n granting the company permission and authority 'to lay their gas mains, pipes, feeders, and service pipes in any of the streets, avenues, highways, public parks, or squares throughout said city, subject at all times, however, to the resolutions and ordinances of the common council of said city.' The act of 1855 was amended February 7, 1865, so as to allow an indefinite increase of the capital stock, and by  3 of this act all the corporate powers of the corporation were vested in a board of directors and such officers and agents as the board should appoint, with power to the board to 'adopt such by-laws, rules, and regulations for the government of said corporation and the management of its affairs and business as they may think proper, not inconsistent with the laws of this state,' the section continuing and concluding, 'and the 4th section of said act is hereby repealed; but ten years after the passage of this act the common council of the city of Chicago may, by resolution or ordinance, regulate the prices charged by said company for gas; but said common council of the city of Chicago shall, in no case, be authorized to compel the said company to furnish gas at a less rate than $3 per thousand feet.'\n In 1870 a new constitution of the state of Illinois was adopted, providing that no law 'making any irrevocable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be passed' (art. II.,  14); that the general assembly should not pass local or special laws 'granting to any corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise whatever' (art. IV.,  22); and that no corporation should be 'created by special laws, or its charter extended, changed, or amended, except those for charitable, educational, penal, or reformatory purposes, which are to be and remain under the patronage and control of the state; but the general assembly shall provide, by general laws, for the organization of all corporations hereafter to be created' (art, XI.,  1).\n June 5, 1897, an act was passed 'in relation to gas companies,' which authorized and empowered gas companies to \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n sell, transfer, convey or lease their real and personal property, rights, franchises, and privileges, in whole or in part, to any other gas company doing business in the same city, town, or village, and provided that by complying with the provisions of the act, gas companies doing business in the same city, town, or village might consolidate and merge into a single corporation, which should be one of said merging and consolidating corporations. 'The companies, parties to the agreement or agreements which provide for consolidation and merger shall thereupon be and are hereby declared to be consolidated and merged into the one corporation specified in such agreement or agreements.' Laws Illinois 1897, p. 179,  2, 8.\n The 9th and 11th sections read as follows:\n' 9 Any corporation purchasing or leasing the real and personal property of any other company or companies, as provided for in  1, or any consolidated corporation, as authorized by  2, shall be subject to and shall perform, for each of the companies so entering into said agreement or agreements, the legal obligations now resting upon each of them, respectively, under their respective charters and ordinances, except where the provisions thereof conflict with the exercise of the powers herein granted, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the companies had remained individual and distinct; and such performance by said corporation so purchasing or leasing, or by such conslidated corporation, shall be held and considered as the performance by each of the respective companies so selling, leasing, or consolidating, of the legal obligations theretofore resting upon each of them respectively: Provided, however, that nothing in this act shall be construed as extinguishing said companies entering into the agreement or agreements mentioned in this act, or annulling or impairing any of their respective franchises, licenses, or privileges, but they shall severally be regarded as still subsisting, so far as their continuance for the purpose of upholding any right, title, or interest, power, privilege, or immunity ever exercised or enjoyed by any of them, may be necessary \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n for the protection of their respective creditors or mortgagees, or any of them; the separate exercise of their respective powers, and the separate enjoyment of their separate privileges and immunities, being suspended until the protection of such creditors or mortgagees shall require their resumption, when such suspension shall cease, so far as, and for such time as, the protection of such creditors or mortgagees may require.'\n\n' 11. Any corporation purchasing or leasing the property of any company or companies, or into which any company or companies are consolidated and merged under this act, shall be, at the time of availing itself of or accepting the benefits of this act, in the actual business of furnishing gas to consumers; and shall be subject to the following provisions:\n\n'Such corporation shall not increase the price charged by it for gas of the quality furnished to consumers during any part of the year immediately preceding such purchase or lease or such consolidation and merger.\n\n'Such corporation shall furnish gas to consumers as good in quality as it furnished previous to such purchase or lease or such consolidation and merger.'\n\n The People's Gaslight & Coke Company under this act became consolidated with some ten other gas companies, most of which were organized under general laws passed in pursuance of the Constitution of 1870. One of them, the Chicago Gaslight & Coke Company, was incorporated by special act of February 12, 1849, amended February 9, 1855, but this contained no restriction on the right of the general assembly or the city to regulate the price of gas from time to time.\n The bill quoted from the 11th section of the act of 1897 the clause in reference to the increase of price for gas of the quality furnished nished consumers during any part of the year immediately preceding purchase or lease, or consolidation and merger, and alleged the fact to be that during the year immediately preceding the acquisition by complainant of the various other gas companies, complainant charged the net rate or price of $1 per thousand cubic feet, and since the acquisition \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n of the plants and property of those corporations that complainant had uniformly charged the same net rate or price for gas sold by it in the city, which gas was better in quality and of higher candle power than the gas theretofore sold by the companies acquired; and complainant averred, as matter of law, that the price or rate thus fixed was a fixing and regulating by the state of the price or rate to be charged by complainant for gas supplied subsequent to the acquisition of said other companies.\n The bill also set forth an agreement made between the city and the People's Gaslight & Coke Company, July 20, 1899, which recited that agreements had theretofore subsisted between the city and the People's Company, and between the city and certain other gas companies, which companies subsequently became merged into the People's Company, and provided for a continuance of the lighting of the streets on the same terms as it had been done, and for the payment by the People's Company to the city of a certain percentage of the gross receipts of the People's Company from the sales of gas during 1899, including therein the receipts from the operation of the properties of each of the gas companies consolidated with the People's Company, and for the payment by the city of amounts due or to become due to the People's Company or confession of judgment for amounts remaining unpaid; and the bill further set forth certain orders of the city between August 5, 1897, and March 11, 1901, for the laying of pipes and mains by the People's Company in the streets and avenues of the city. Certain mortgages were likewise referred to and it was alleged that bonds thereunder had been sold to parties who purchased the same in the belief that the city was prohibited by its charter from compelling the People's Company to furnish gas at a less rate than $3 per thousand cubic feet.\n The bill also averred that the People's Company, prior to the consolidation, distributed gas chiefly in the west division of the city, although its pipes and mains extended into the south \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n division, and that the other companies, or nearly all them, severally had plants and were engaged in manufacturing and distributing gas in various other sections of the city.\n On March 5, 1900, the city council passed an ordinance which provided 'that no cerporation, company or companies, firm or persons manufacturing, selling, supplying, or distributing gas in the city of Chicago for illuminating or for fuel purposes shall charge, exact, demand, or collect from any consumer thereof more than the sum of seventy-five (75) cents per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of gas consumed or used.'\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court was invoked on the ground of impairment or deprivation by the ordinance of contract rights of complainant acquired by its charter, and the bill prayed, among other things, 'that it may be adjudged and decreed that by said charter of the People's Gaslight & Coke Company, the people of the state of Illinois agreed with the People's Gaslight & Coke Company that the common council of the city of Chicago should never be authorized to compel the Peopel's Gaslight & Coke Company to furnish gas at a less rate than $3 per thousand cubic feet, and that such contract is a valuable property right of the said People's Gaslight & Coke Company.'\n The circuit court declined to specifically dispose of complainant's contention that by the act of February 7, 1865, the state had contracted that the city should never require the company to furnish gas at a less rate than $3 per thousand feet, because it held that the limitation or exemption, even if conceded, did not apply to the territory and rights acquired by the merger, and that the bill did not seek divisional relief, and was not framed in that aspect; while most of the consolidated companies were organized under the general incorporation law passed in pursuance of the Constitution of 1870, and the right to fix reasonable rates was reserved, the works not having been installed under any explicit contract to the contrary, if such could have been entered into.\n As to the clause of the 11th section of the act of June 5, \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n 1897, providing: 'Such corporation shall not increase the price charged by it for gas of the quality furnished to consumers during any part of the year immediately preceding such purchase or lease, or such consolidation and merger,' the circuit court ruled that this did not fix a rate unalterable by either party, but a rate beyond which the consolidated companies could not go.\n The circuit court further held that the contention that the state's power to regulate rates had not been delegated to the city was not a Federal question, and that, as the ground of impairment or deprivation of contract rights acquired by the charter failed under the bill as framed, the court could not go further and decide that question in this case. While the decree, as it stands, amended by consent, in terms reserved the question, to be raised in some other appropriate suit in a proper court.\n In these circumstances we are constrained to decline the consideration of that question so far as it relates to the contention that power to regulate was conferred by the general law of Illinois of 1871-2 providing for the incorporation of cities and villages under which the city of Chicago as now constituted was incorporated.\n But the decree dismissed the bill 'as to the alleged contract rights of complainant,' and in so doing the circuit court dealt with the alleged fixing of rates by the act of 1897, as well as with the alleged contract of 1865, that the city should not be authorized to fix a rate of less than $ 3; for although, as we have said, it was the impairment or deprivation of the latter which was made the ground of Federal jurisdiction, it was in effect as asserted to have been modified by the act of 1897. We agree with the circuit court that the clause of  11 of the act of 1897, that 'such corporation shall not increase the price charged by it for gas of the quality furnished to consumers during any part of the year immediately preceding such purchase or lease or such consolidation or merger,' read according to the plain and ordinary signification of \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n the words, it being a general law applicable to every gas company and to every city in the state, was not intended to fix and did not fix, a rate unalterable by either party, but simply a rate above which consolidated companies could not go. This disposes of it as an independent ground of relief, and leaves to be considered the provision of the amended charter of 1865, that 'ten years after the passage of this act the common council of the city of Chicago may, by resolution or ordinance, regulate the prices charged by said company for gas; but said common council of the city of Chicago shall, in no case, be authorized to compel the said company to furnish gas at a less rate than $3 per thousand feet,' as affected by the act of 1897. That is to say, was the city cut off from reducing the price below $1, conceding the power of the state to do so?\n It is contended, on the one hand, that the first part of this provision granted the city the general power to regulate the price after ten years, and that the latter part then ceased to operate as a restriction. And, on the other hand, that the whole clause constituted a contract that the general assembly would not thereafter authorize the city to fix the rate at less than $3. But it is expressly conceded that the general assembly possessed the power to regulate the price of gas and to prescribe reasonable rates, and that, as complainant availed itself of the act of 1897, and thereby acquired the plants of other gas companies, it can now only charge the rate it had been charging the year immediately preceding the acquisition of those properties,-namely, $1 per thousand cubic feet.\n Assuming, but without intimating any opinion to that effect, that by the amended charter of 1865 the state contracted with the People's Gaslight & Coke Company that the city should not thereafter be empowered to reduce the price of gas below $3 per thousand feet, the preliminary inquiry is whether, by the consolidation, that contract was extended to the plants of, and territory occupied by, the companies absorbed. \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n The circuit court held that it was not so extended, and that as the bill sought relief in respect of the entire plants and territory, the entire system as consolidated, it could not be maintained, because there was no such contract which the ordinance impaired or destroyed.\n It is said that partial relief might have been accorded unless by the consolidation the alleged exemption was lost, but the bill was not framed in the alternative, and the ordinance itself did not contemplate a divided operation, although, if the exemption existed as to part of the system, the ordinance would not necessarily be wholly void, but might be held inoperative pro tanto, notwithstanding serious difficulties in so applying it. See Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 718\n, 24 L. ed. 310, and cases cited.\n Was the alleged exemption extended by the act of 1897, when the other companies were acquired?\n Prior to that time the operations of the People's Company were practically confined to the west division of the city, and although it was empowered to lay pipes in any of the streets or avenues, this was only with the city's consent. The city in 1858 authorized the company to do this, but this was 'subject at all times' to the city's resolutions and ordinances.\n It is true that after the acquisition of the other companies the city compromised with the People's Company in respect of claims for gas furnished, and also ordered the company to lay mains in streets which formerly did not have them, but this action was not equivalent to consent to the extension of the alleged restriction on rates to territory acquired under the merger, with the accomplishment of which the city had nothing to do.\n The act of 1897 provided that the consolidated corporation should be subject to the legal obligations of the companies taken over, and most of these were not exempt from the right of regulation, and were obliged to submit to its exercise.\n By the state Constitution the general assembly was forbidden to make 'any irrevocable grant of special privileges or im- \n\n[194 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n munities,' and the general rule is that a special statutory exemption, such as immunity from taxation, from the right to determine rates of fare, or to control tolls, and the like, does not pass to a new corporation succeeding others by consolidation or purchase, in the absence of express direction to that effect in the statute.

And the same rule is applicable where the constituent companies are merely owned and operated by one of them as authorized by the legislature. An exemption held by the latter would not pass to the others unless so provided. So that the act of 1897 cannot be construed as extending any prior immunity the acquiring company possessed over the whole system of all the companies consolidated.\n And if not, and the circuit court was right, as we think it was, in holding that under the present bill complainant's alleged exemption could not be enforced as to so much of the system as originally belonged to it, then the court was justified in declining to discuss whether, by the consolidation, the alleged exemption was lost altogether.\n In short, agreeing with the circuit court, we are of opinion that the asserted immunity (conceding it arguendo) did not extend to so much of the system as passed to the consolidated company from companies not possessing such immunity in their own right; that under this bill relief could not be accorded in respect of part of the system; that no contract that the price of gas should not be reduced below $1 per thousand feet was created, nor was the alleged original exemption merely modified and extended; and that the decree dismissing the bill because there were no such contract rights as alleged impaired or destroyed by the ordinance was right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETTIT v. WALSHE(1904)\nNo. 563\nArgued: April 6, 1904Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles Fox for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ferdinand Winter and Addison C. Harris for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a case of extradition. It presents the question whether a commissioner specially appointed by a court of the United States under and in execution of statutes enacted to give effect to treaty stipulations for the apprehension and delivery of offenders, can issue a warrant for the arrest of an alleged criminal, which may be executed by a marshal of the United States, within his district, in a state other than the one in which the commissioner has his office. It also presents \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n the question whether a person arrested under such a warrant can be lawfully taken beyond the state in which he was found, and delivered in another state before the officer who issued the warrant of arrest, without any preliminary examination in the former state as to the criminality of the charge against him.\n By the 10th article of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, concluded August 9th, 1842, it was provided that upon mutual requisitions by them, or their ministers, officers, or authorities, respectively made, they shall 'deliver up to justice all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum, or shall be found, within the territories of the other.' But by the same article it was provided that 'this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offense had there been committed; and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, that he may be brought before such judges or other magistrates, respectively, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify the same to the proper executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of such fugitive. The expense of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by the party who makes the requisition, and receives the fugitive.' 8 Stat. at L. 572, 576.\n A supplementary treaty between the same countries, concluded July 12th, 1889, provided for the extradition for certain crimes not specified in the 10th article of the treaty of 1842, \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n and 'punishable by the laws of both countries;' and, also, declared that the provisions of the above article 'shall apply to persons convicted of the crimes therein respectively named and specified, whose sentence therefor shall not have been executed. In case of a fugitive criminal alleged to have been convicted of the crime of which his surrender is asked, a copy of the record of the conviction, and of the sentence of the court before which such conviction took place, duly authenticated, shall be produced, together with the evidence proving that the prisoner is the person to whom such sentence refers.' 26 Stat. at L. 1508, 1510\n\n\n By an act of Congress, approved August 12th, 1848, chap. 167, and entitled 'An Act for Giving Effect to Certain Treaty Stipulations Between This and Foreign Governments for the Apprehension and Delivering Up of Certain Offenders,' it is provided ( 1): 'That in all cases in which there now exists, or hereafter may exist, any treaty or convention for extradition between the government of the United States and any foreign government, it shall and may be lawful for any of the justices of the Supreme Court or judges of the several district courts of the United States-and the judges of the several state courts, and the commissioners authorized so to do by any of the courts of the United States, are hereby severally vested with power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon complaint made under oath or affirmation, charging any person found within the limits of any state, district, or territory, with having committed within the jurisdiction of any such foreign government any of the crimes enumerated or provided for by any such treaty or convention-to issue his warrant for the apprehension of the person so charged, that he may be brought before such judge or commissioner, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient by him to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, it shall be his duty to certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of such foreign government, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of said treaty or convention; and it shall be the duty of the said judge or commissioner to issue his warrant for the commitment of the person so charged to the proper gaol, there to remain until such surrender shall be made.' ' 6. That it shall be lawful for the courts of the United States, or any of them, to authorize any person or persons to act as a commissioner or commissioners, under the provisions of this act; and the doings of such person or persons so authorized, in pursuance of any of the provisions aforesaid, shall be good and available to all intents and purposes whatever.' 9 Stat. at L. 302.\n And by  5270 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3591)-omitting therefrom the proviso added thereto by the act of June 6th, 1900, chap. 793, 31 Stat. at L. 656 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3591), which applies only to crimes committed in a foreign country or territory 'occupied by or under the control of the United States'-it is provided: 'Whenever there is a treaty or convention for extradition between the government of the United States and any foreign government, any justice of the Supreme Court, circuit judge, district judge, commissioner, authorized so to do by any of the courts of the United States, or judge of a court of record of general jurisdiction of any state, may, upon complaint made under oath, charging any person found within the limits of any state, district, or territory, with having committed within the jurisdiction of any such foreign government any of the crimes provided for by such treaty or convention, issue his warrant for the apprehension of the person so charged, that he may be brought before such justice, judge, or commissioner, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered. If, on such hearing, he deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n proper authorities of such foreign government, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of the treaty or convention; and he shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the person so charged to the proper jail, there to remain until such surrender shall be made.' See also  5273 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3596).\n In the sundry civil appropriation act of August 18th, 1894, will be found the following clause: 'Provided, That it shall be the duty of the marshal, his deputy, or other officer, who may arrest a person charged with any crime or offense, to take the defendant before the nearest circuit court commissioner or the nearest judicial officer having jurisdiction under existing laws for a hearing, commitment, or taking bail for trial, and the officer or magistrate issuing the warrant shall attach thereto a certified copy of the complaint, and upon the arrest of the accused, the return of the warrant, with a copy of the complaint attached, shall confer jurisdiction upon such officer as fully as if the complaint had originally been made before him, and no mileage shall be allowed any officer violating the provisions hereof.' 28 Stat. at L. 416, chap. 301 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 717).\n Under these treaty and statutory provisions, complaint on oath was made before John A. Shields-a commissioner appointed by the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York to execute the above act of August 12th, 1848, and the several acts amendatory thereof- that one James Lynchehaun was convicted, in a court of Great Britain, of the crime of having feloniously and unlawfully wounded one Agnes McDonnell, with intent thereby, feloniously and with malice aforethought, to kill and murder said McDonnel; that the accused was sentenced to be kept in penal servitude for his natural life; that in execution of such sentence he was committed to a convict prison in Queens county, Ireland, had escaped therefrom, and was at large; and that he was a fugitive from the justice of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and within the territory of the United States. It is admitted that the present appellee is the person referred to in the warrant as James Lynchehaun. \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n Upon that complaint, Commissioner Shields, in his capacity as a commissioner appointed by a court of the United States, to execute the laws relating to the extradition of fugitives from the justice of foreign countries, issued, on the 6th day of June, 1903, in the name of the President, a warrant addressed 'to any marshal of the United States, to the deputies of any such marshal, or any or either of them,' commanding that the accused be forthwith taken and brought before him, at his office, in the city of New York, in order that the evidence as to his criminality be heard and considered, and if deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, that the same might be certified, together with a copy of all the proceedings, to the Secretary of State, in order that a warrant might be issued for the surrender of the accused, pursuant to the above treaty.\n This warrant having been placed for execution in the hands of the appellant, as marshal of the United States for the district of Indiana, he arrested the accused in that state. Thereupon the latter filed his application for a writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court of the United States for that district, alleging that his detention was in violation of the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States. The writ was issued, and the marshal justified his action under the warrant, issued by Commissioner Shields. Referring to the warrant and averring its due service upon the accused, the marshal's return stated that the warrant was 'regular, legal, valid, and sufficient in law in all respects to legally justify and warrant the arrest and detention of petitioner, and, under the laws of the United States, it was and is the duty of this defendant to arrest and detain said petitioner, and deliver him as commanded by said writ for hearing before Commissioner Shields, in New York city; that said writ runs for service in the state of Indiana, although issued by a commissioner of the United States for the southern district of New York, by reason of its being a writ in extradition; that defendant is informed and believes, and therefore states the fact to be, that petitioner is the identical person commanded to be arrested by said warrant as James \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 216]\n\u00a0\n Lynchehaun; . . . and that it is by virtue and authority solely of said warrant that defendant holds and detains petitioner; that defendant proposes, if not otherwise ordered by this honorable court, to obey, as United States marshal for the district of Indiana, the command of said warrant as set out therein believing it to be his duty as said officer so to do.'\n The accused excepted to the marshal's return for insufficiency in law, and the case was heard upon that exception. The court held the return to be insufficient; and the marshal having indicated his purpose not to amend it, the accused was discharged upon the ground that the commissioner in New York was without power to issue a warrant under which the marshal for the district of Indiana could legally arrest the accused and deliver him before the court of that commissioner in New York without a previous examination before some proper officer in the state where he was found. Re Walshe, 125 Fed. 572.\n The appellee contends that this case only involves a construction of certain acts of Congress, and that, therefore, this court is without jurisdiction to review the judgment on direct appeal from the circuit court. Spreckels Sugar Ref. Co. v. McClain, \n192 U.S. 397\n, 407, ante, 376, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 376. We do not concur in this view. The treaties of 1842 and 1889 are at the basis of this litigation, and no effective decision can be made of the controlling questions arising upon the appeal without an examination of those treaties, and a determination of the meaning and scope of some of their provisions. A case may be brought directly from a circuit court to this court if the construction of a treaty is therein drawn in question. 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517,  5 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549). The petition for the writ of habeas corpus, and the warrant under which the accused was arrested, both refer to the treaty of 1842, and the court below properly, we think, proceeded on the ground that the determination of the questions involved in the case depended in part, at least, on the meaning of certain provisions of that treaty. The construction of the treaties was none the less drawn in question because it became necessary \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 217]\n\u00a0\n or appropriate for the court below also to construe the acts of Congress passed to carry their provisions into effect.\n We now go to the merits of the case. It has been seen that the treaty of 1842 expressly provides, among other things, that a person charged with the crime of murder, committed within the jurisdiction of either country, and found within the territories of the other, shall be delivered up by the latter country; and that the provision shall apply in the case of one convicted of such a crime, but whose sentence has not been executed. But both countries stipulated in the treaty of 1842 that the alleged criminal shall be arrested and delivered up only upon such evidence of criminality, as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive person so charged is found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed. As applied to the present case, that stipulation means that the accused, Walshe, could not be extradited under the treaties in question, except upon such evidence of criminality as, under the laws of the state of Indiana,-the place in which he was found,-would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime alleged had been there committed. The words in the 10th article of the treaty of 1842, 'as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had there been committed,' and the words 'punishable by the laws of both countries,' in the treaty of 1889, standing alone, might be construed as referring to this country as a unit, as it exists under the Constitution of the United States. But as there are no common-law crimes of the United States, and as the crime of murder, as such, is not known to the national government, except in places over which it may exercise exclusive jurisdiction, the better construction of the treaty is, that the required evidence as to the criminality of the charge against the accused must be such as would authorize his apprehension and commitment for trial in that state of the Union in which he is arrested. \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 218]\n\u00a0\n It was substantially so held in Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 58\n, 61 S., 47 L. ed. 948, 954, 955, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 781, 785, 786, which was a case of extradition under the same treaties as those here involved. In that case the alleged fugitive criminal from the justice of Great Britain was found in New York. The court said: 'As the state of New York was the place where the accused was found, and, in legal effect, the asylum to which he had fled, is the language of the treaty, 'made criminal by the laws of both countries,' to be interpreted as limiting its scope to acts of Congress, and eliminating the operation of the laws of the states? That view would largely defeat the object of our extradition treaties by ignoring the fact that for nearly all crimes and misdemeanors the laws of the states, and not the enactments of Congress, must be looked to for the definition of the offense. There are no common-law crimes of the United States, and, indeed, in most of the states the criminal law has been recast in statutes, the common law being resorted to in aid of definition. Benson v. McMahon, \n127 U.S. 457\n, 32 L. ed. 234, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1240.' Again: 'When by the law of Great Britain, and by the law of the state in which the fugitive is found, the fraudulent acts charged to have been committed are made criminal, the case comes fairly within the treaty, which otherwise would manifestly be inadequate to accomplish its purposes. And we cannot doubt that if the United States were seeking to have a person indicted for this same offense under the laws of New York extradited from Great Britain, the tribunals of Great Britain would not decline to find the offense charged to be within the treaty because the law violated was a statute of one of the states, and not an act of Congress.'\n The above provision in the treaty of 1842 has not been modified or superseded by any of the acts passed by Congress to carry its provisions into effect. In our opinion, the evidence of the criminality of the charge must be heard and considered by some judge or magistrate authorized by the acts of Congress to act in extradition matters, and sitting in the state where the accused was found and arrested. Under any other interpretation of the statute Commissioner Shields, proceeding \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 219]\n\u00a0\n under the treaty, could by his warrant cause a person charged with one of the extraditable crimes, and found in one of the Pacific states, to be brought before him at his office in the city of New York, in order that he might hear and consider the evidence of the criminality of the accused. But as such a harsh construction is not demanded by the words of the treaties or of the statutes, we shall not assume that any such result was contemplated by Congress. While the view just stated, has some support in those parts of the act of 1848, and  5270 of the Revised Statutes which provide for the accused being brought before the justice, judge, or commissioner who issued the warrant of arrest, it is not consistent with the above proviso in the sundry civil act of August 18th, 1894, the language of which is broad enough to embrace the case of the arrest by a marshal, within the district for which he was appointed, of a person charged with an extraditable crime committed in the territories of Great Britain, and found in this country. By that proviso it is made the duty of a marshal arresting a person charged with any crime or offense to take him before the nearest circuit court commissioner or the nearest judicial officer, having jurisdiction, for a hearing, commitment, or taking bail for trial in cases of extradition. The commissioner or judicial officer here referred to is necessarily one acting as such within the state in which the accused was arrested and found. So that, assuming that it was competent for the marshal for the district of Indiana to execute Commissioner Shields' warrant within his district, as we think it was, his duty was to take the accused before the nearest magistrate in that district, who was authorized by the treaties and by the above acts of Congress to hear and consider the evidence of criminality. If such magistrate found that the evidence sustained the charge, then, under  5270 of the Revised Statutes, it would be his duty to issue his warrant for the commitment of the accused to the proper jail, there to remain until he was surrendered under the direction of the national government, in accordance with the treaty. Instead of pursuing that course, the marshal \n\n[194 U.S. 205, 220]\n\u00a0\n arrested Walshe, and in his return to the writ of habeas corpus distinctly avowed his purpose, unless restrained by the court, to take the prisoner at once from the state in which he was found, and deliver him in New York, before Commissioner Shields, without a hearing first had in the state of Indiana before some authorized officer or magistrate there sitting, as to the evidence of the criminality of the accused. The circuit court adjudged that the marshal had no authority to hold the accused in custody for any such purpose; and, the marshal declining to amend his return, and not avowing his intention to take him before a judicial officer or magistrate in Indiana for purposes of hearing the evidence of criminality, the prisoner was properly discharged from the custody of that officer.\n For the reasons above stated the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPLATT v. WILMOT(1904)\nNo. 167\nArgued: March 2, 1904Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n Plaintiff in error brings the case here to review the judgment of the United States circuit court of appeals for the \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 603]\n\u00a0\n second circuit, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court for the northern district of New York, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint upon the merits. The action was commenced in the last-named court by the service of a summons on the defendant on October 1, 1898, and was brought by the plaintiff as receiver of the Commercial National Bank of Denver, Colorado, to recover from the defendant the double liability imposed upon him as stockholder in the Western Farm Mortgage Trust Company of Lawrence, Kansas, herinafter called the trust company.\n The defendant answered the complaint, and, among other things, set up the defense of the three years' statute of limitations of the state of New York.\n The action was tried in the circuit court for the northern district of New York without a jury, and findings of fact were made by the court upon which the conclusion of law was based that the plaintiff's cause of action was barred by  394 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state of New York, being the three years' statute of limitations, and that his complaint should therefore be dismissed with costs.\n The court found that the bank of which plaintiff was subsequently appointed receiver had commenced an action against the trust company, and on June 3, 1893, had recovered a personal judgment against it for the sum of $4,930.72, with interest thereon from the date of the recovery of the judgment. Execution had been issued upon said judgment on August 29, 1894, and returned unsatisfied on September 7, 1894\n\n\n At the time of the rendition of the judgment and the return of the execution unsatisfied, the defendant was the holder of, and has continued since that time to hold, twenty shares of the capital stock of the trust company.\n By the terms of its articles of association the corporate powers of the trust company were, among others, as follows:\n'Article II. The purposes for which it is formed are to receive deposits of money, bonds, and securities; to loan money on real estate and personal security; to negotiate loans on real \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 604]\n\u00a0\n estate and other securities; to purchase and sell bonds and notes secured by mortgages and deeds of trusts on real estate; to purchase and sell municipal bonds and the bonds, assets, and franchises and securities of other corporations; to issue and sell its debentures and secure the same by pledge of notes, bonds, and other securities, real or personal; to guarantee the payment of principal and interest of loans by it negotiated or made and sold; to act as financial agent of any state, municipality, corporation, association, company, or person; to purchase, hold, sell, and convey such real estate and personal property as it may require for its use; to purchase, hold, sell, and convey such real estate and personal property as may be necessary for the security or collection of claims due or owing it; to accept and execute any trust committed to it by any municipality, corporation, association, company, person, or other authority.'\n\n Judgment dismissing the complaint having been entered, the plaintiff, by virtue of a writ of error, obtained a review of the judgment by the circuit court of appeals of the second circuit, where it was affirmed, without any opinion, upon the authority, as stated in a memorandum by the court, of the case of Hobbs v. National Bank of Commerce, 37 C. C. A. 513, 30 N. Y. Civ. Proc. Rep. 24, 96 Fed. 396.\n The Constitution and statutes of Kansas provide for the individual liability of the stockholders in a corporation to an additional amount equal to the stock owned by each stockholder, but the provision does not apply to a railroad corporation, nor to corporations for religious or charitable purposes.\n Messrs. Omar Powell and Elijah Robinson for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 602, 606]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The only question which the plaintiff in error presents is \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 607]\n\u00a0\n whether or not this action was barred by the New York three years' statute of limitations, and that depends upon whether  382 or  394 of the Code of Civil Procedure of that state is applicable.\n Section 382 provides that actions of the following nature shall be barred within six years.\n'1. An action upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or implied, except a judgment or sealed instrument.\n\n'2. An action to recover upon a liability created by statute, except a penalty or forfeiture.'\n\n Section 394, which the courts below have made applicable to plaintiff's cause of action, reads as follows:\n'Sec. 394. This chapter does not affect an action against a director or stockholder of a moneyed corporation, or banking association, to recover a penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce a liability created by the common law or by statute; but such an action must be brought within three years after the cause of action has accrued.'\n\n Several objections are made by the plaintiff in error to the application of  394 to this case. They are (1) that the section does not apply to a director or stockholder of a foreign corporation; (2) that if it be held that it does extend to actions against directors and stockholders of foreign corporations of the class designated in the section, yet it does not apply to this case, because the trust company is neither a moneyed corporation nor a banking association; (3) that the stockholders' liability in this case is one based upon contract, and is not created either by the common law or by statute.\n Taking up these objections in their order, we are brought to a consideration of the one which asserts that  394 does not apply to directors or stockholders of foreign corporations. We think it does.\n A history of the legislation upon this subject in the state of New York, which finally resulted in  394 of the Civil Code, is given in the opinion in Hobbs v. National Bank of Commerce, 37 C. C. A. 513, 30 N. Y. Civ. Proc. Rep. 24, 96 Fed. 396, by Judge Shipman, and it is also \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 608]\n\u00a0\n referred to by Judge Earl, in Brinckerhoff v. Bostuick, 99 N. Y. 185, 1 N. E. 663.\n The section as originally enacted was  44, part 3, chap. 4, title 2, of the Revised Statutes, which chapter related to 'Actions, and the Times of Commencing Them.' These statutes took effect (as to the greater part) in 1830. The section in question then read as follows:\n'None of the provisions of this chapter shall apply to suits against directors or stockholders of any moneyed corporations to recover any penalty or forfeiture imposed or to enforce any liability created by the second title of the eighteenth chapter of the first part of the Revised Statutes; but all such suits shall be brought within six years after the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts upon which such penalty or forfeiture attached or by which such liability was created.'\n\n Upon the adoption of the Code of Procedure of 1848 the section became  89 of that Code. The second title of the first part of the Revised Statutes, referred to in the section, among other things, imposed liabilities upon the directors and stockholders of the moneyed corporations authorized by that title. If the statute of limitations above quoted had not been amended, it would have been limited to the liabilities mentioned in such title, and would not have included a case like this.\n In 1849  89 of the Code of Procedure of 1848 became  109, and read as follows:\n'This title shall not affect actions against directors or stockholders of a moneyed corporation or banking associations to recover a penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce a liability created by law; but such included a case like this. after the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts upon which the penalty or forfeiture attached or the liability was created.'\n\n The difference in the two sections is plainly seen, and consists in striking out the words as to a liability created by the Revised Statutes, and enlarging the operation of the section \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 609]\n\u00a0\n to a 'liability created by law.' The words 'liability created by law,' were held in Brinckerhoff v. Bostwick, 99 N. Y. 185, 1 N. E. 663, to mean statutory liabilities which, as stated by Judge Earl (page 192, N. E. p. 666), 'comprehend not only liabilities created by the title and chapter of the Revised Statutes referred to, but also those created by other statutes and the Constitution of 1846 (art. 8,  7).'\n In 1877 another amendment was made to the section by leaving out the words 'six years after the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts upon which the penalty or forfeiture attached, or the liability was created,' and substituting therefor the words 'three years after the cause of action accrued.'\n The act was further amended in 1897, and the statute ( 394) reads, after that amendment, in the way it has been quoted above, so that the action must be brought within three years after the cause of action has accrued to enforce a liability created by the common law or by statute.\n As to the meaning of this statute, it was held in the Hobbs Case, 37 C. C. A. 513, 30 N. Y. Civ. Proc. Rep. 24, 96 Fed. 396, that the legislature meant to enlarge the former limitation so it should no longer be limited to liabilities created by one set of statutes or imposed upon the officers or stockholders of moneyed corporations or banking associations within the state only, but the terms of the statute were held to be so broad as to include every class of liabilities of such stockholders, whether they were stockholders of foreign or domestic corporations. The statute was held to be a totally different one from that which was originally passed, and the language evinced an intention that it should not be so limited as to apply only in favor of a New York stockholder in a domestic corporation, but that, on the contrary, the statute should also apply to a shareholder in a foreign corporation.\n In our view this interpretation by the circuit court of appeals is the correct one. We are of opinion that the amendments were not intended to continue the application of the limitation to those corporations only which were domestic and \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 610]\n\u00a0\n were of the kind mentioned in the Revised Statutes, because, as amended, the statute used language which was inconsistent with that idea. The original reference to the liabilities of directors and stockholders under the second title of the Revised Statutes was stricken out and in place thereof language was used which clearly indicated a purpose to extend the statute to all liabilities of directors or stockholders in any corporation, foreign or domestic, which liabilities were created by common law or by statute, provided the corporation was a moneyed corporation or banking association. We can see no reason why the director or stockholder of a domestic corporation should cease to be liable in three years from the time the cause of action accrued, while if he were a director or stockholder of a foreign corporation his liability should still last for six years, upon a suit commenced in New York.\n It is not the case of a state legislature assuming to regulate foreign corporations, and no such attempt has been made. The substance of the legislation is that when suits are brought in the state of New York to enforce therein the liabilities of directors or stockholders, the statute of limitation enacted by the legislature of that state in regard to directors or stockholders of domestic corporations shall also apply to directors or stockholders of foreign corporations. This is what the legislature has done and this is what it had the right to do.\n The Federal courts, sitting in the state, will, in cases brought therein, enforce the state statute of limitations in actions of this nature.\n This view of the statute is not affected by reason of the language of the revised corporation law of New York, chap. 563 of the Laws of 1890. That act is, by its terms, confined to corporations under the laws of New York; but  394 of the Code is a different statute, and, as has been seen, refers to any corporation, foreign or domestic, which may be a moneyed corporation or banking association within the meaning of the law of New York.\n The next objection is, that even if the statute referred to \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 611]\n\u00a0\n foreign as well as domestic corporations, yet the trust company is not a moneyed corporation within the meaning of the section in question. What is meant by the term 'moneyed corporation,' in  394 is shown by the definition of that term given in 1 Rev. Stat. 598,  51, where it is said: 'Section 51. The term 'moneyed corporation,' as used in this title, shall be construed to mean every corporation having banking powers, or having the power to make loans upon pledges or deposits, or authorized by law to make insurances.'\n Although this definition refers to the meaning of the term 'moneyed corporation,' as used in that title of the Revised Statutes, we think it is plain that the same term used in  394 of the Code means the same thing as defined in  51. The legislature used a term which was well known in the legislation of New York and for a long period of years a definite meaning had been given to it in that legislation, and when speaking of limitations of actions in regard to moneyed corporations nothing would be more natural than to assume that the term when thus used should have the same meaning applied to it as had been defined by the ligislature when enacting legislation in regard to moneyed corporations. This legislation does not assume to enact what shall be 'moneyed corporations,' in other states, but its effect is that when actions are brought in the state of New York and the question arises whether a foreign corporation is or is not a moneyed corporation, that question will be solved in such a case as this for the purpose of construing the statute of limitations of the state, by reference to the meaning given to the term by the legislature or courts of New York, rather than by reference to the legislation of another state under which the corporation may have been formed. The question is not what the corporation is under the legislation of that other state, but whether what it is doing is of that description provided for and designated by the legislation of the state of New York, and if by that legislation it comes within the description of a 'moneyed corporation,' it must abide thereby so far as re- \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 612]\n\u00a0\n gards the statute of limitations of New York and the proper construction to be given it.\n Now, by reference to the powers granted to the trust company, it will be seen that it had power 'to receive deposits of money, bonds, and securities; to loan money on real estate and personal security; . . .' etc. The powers granted to the trust company bring it distinctly within the definition of the term 'moneyed corporation' as used in  394 of the Code of New York. It had power to loan money not only on real estate but on personal security, and the statute of New York said any corporation having the power to make loans upon pledges or deposits was a moneyed corporation within the meaning of the act.\n Again, referring to the revised corporation act of New York of 1890, a moneyed corporation is therein stated to be one formed under or subject to the banking or the insurance law. If a foreign corporation have powers, or some of them, which are given a banking association under the law of New York, that foreign corporation is, under the circumstances of this case, a moneyed corporation or banking association within the meaning of the New York statute of limitations now under discussion. This corporation has, at least, some of those powers, and we think comes within the definition of a banking association, although it also has other powers.\n The third objection is that the liability of the stockholder in this case is not created by the common law or by statute, but is contractual in its nature, and, is, therefore, governed by  382 (the material portion of which has alreacy been set forth), instead of  394 of the Code.\n The case of Whitman v. National Bank, \n176 U.S. 559\n, 44 L. ed. 587, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477, is cited to show that the double liability of the stockholder under the Kansas Constitution and statutes is of a contractual nature, and, therefore, not within  394, because it is not a liability created by common law or by statute. In the Whitman Case it was held that this liability, though statutory in origin, was contractual in its nature; or, in other words, the \n\n[193 U.S. 602, 613]\n\u00a0\n stockholder, when he subscribed for or purchased his stock, entered into a contract authorized by statute. In that case it was also held that the constitutional provision did not stand alone, but that the legislature of Kansas had also acted on the subject-matter. and that the Constitution and the statutes were to be taken together as making one body of law, and that, therefore, it would serve no good purpose to inquire what rights or remedies a creditor of a corporation might have or what liabilities would rest upon a stockholder if either Constitution or statutes stood alone and unaided by the other.\n We think, within the meaning of  394, this liability was created by statute, as it was by virtue of the statutes that the contractual liability arose. The language of the section plainly includes this case. It is a liability created by the statute, because the statute is the foundation for the implied contract arising from the purchase of, or subscription for, the stock, the contract being that the holder of the stock shall be liable in accordance with the terms of the statute.\n Also, while the liability is contractual in its nature, it arises out of the Constitution or the statute, or from a combination of both, by virtue of the application of general principles of law to the facts in the case. Neither the Constitution nor the statute says that the liability is contractual, but, as the Constitution and statute existed, the liability arising therefrom, as against the stockholder, is because of the principle of law which works out a contractual liability upon these facts, and it may be fitly described as the common law.\n We think the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is right, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPLYMOUTH CORDAGE CO. v.

Smith to file a motion asking the court to set aside the order of April 6, 1903, dismissing the petition in involuntary bankruptcy against J. A. Smith.'\n\n\n (4)\n That petitioners prayed the court 'to set aside each and all of the foregoing orders so entered by the district court of Kingfisher county, Oklahoma.'\n And propounding the following question or proposition of law:\n'Does the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit have the jurisdiction to superintend and revise, in matter of law, the proceedings of the district court of Kingfisher county, Oklahoma, in bankruptcy?'\n\n Messrs. E. C. Brandenburg, Edwin A. Krauthoff, Patrick S. Nagle, W. A. McCarteney, and Messrs. Brandenburg & Brandenburg and Karnes, New, & Kranuthoff for Plymouth Cordage Company et al.\n No brief was filed for Smith et al.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the bankruptcy law, the district courts of the United States in the several states, the supreme court of the District of Columbia, the district courts of the several territories, and the United States courts in the Indian territory and the district of Alaska, are made courts of bankruptcy.\n By subdivision 3 of  1, the words 'appellate courts' are defined to 'include the circuit courts of appeals of the United States, the supreme courts of the territories, and the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n'Appellate jurisdiction of controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy from which they have appellate jurisdiction in other cases,' is vested by  24a in the Supreme Court of the United States, the \n\n[194 U.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n circuit courts of appeals of the United States, and the supreme courts of the territories. And by  24b it is provided that the several circuit courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction in equity 'to superintend and revise, in matter of law, the proceedings of the several inferior courts of bankruptcy within their jurisdiction.'\n\n By  25a appeals, 'as in equity cases, may be taken in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy to the circuit court of appeals of the United States, and to the supreme court of the territories' from judgments adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt; granting or denying a discharge; and allowing or rejecting a claim of $500 or over. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[194 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n The act clearly distinguishes between 'controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings' and 'bankruptcy proceedings' proper, and between supervisory jurisdiction in a summary way in matter of law, and jurisdiction by appeal or writ of error. Appellate jurisdiction over controversies, as in other cases, is vested by  24a, and over certain designated bankruptcy proceedings by  25a, by appeal, as in equity cases, bringing up both law and fact.\n The question before us arises on a petition to revise certain proceedings in a court of bankruptcy of the territory of Oklahoma. That territory, by order of this court, as required by law, was assigned in 1891 to the eighth judicial circuit, \n139 U.S. 707\n, 35 L. ed. 1128 b, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. IV., and the courts of the territory were thereby brought within the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals for that circuit.\n By the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, that jurisdiction embraced the review of the judgments, orders, and decrees of the supreme courts of the territories in cases in which the judgments of the circuit courts of appeals were made final by that act, but in other cases the jurisdiction remained in this court. Shute v. Keyser, \n149 U.S. 649\n, 37 L. ed. 884, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 960.\n Then came the bankruptcy law making the district courts of the territories courts of bankruptcy, and providing that their proceedings as such might be revised by the circuit \n\n[194 U.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n courts of appeals within whose jurisdiction they happened to be.\n We think the law should be taken as it is written, and perceive no adequate reason for concluding that the real intention of Congress is not expressed in the language used. Congress may well have believed it wisest that the circuit courts of appeals should deal in this summary way with questions of law arising in the progress of bankruptcy proceedings in the territorial courts, although jurisdiction by appeal or writ of error, and by appeal, as provided, was vested in the supreme courts of the territories.\n The circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit has announced the same conclusion (Re Seebold, 45 C. C. A. 117, 105 Fed. 910, 914), as has the supreme court of Oklahoma (Ex parte Stumpff, 9 Okla. 639, 60 Pac. 96). A different view appears to have been entertained by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit in Re Blair, 45 C. C. A. 530, 106 Fed. 662, though apparently the case did not necessarily require the precise question to be passed on.\n Question answered in the affirmative. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 24.

WILLIAMS(1904)\nNo. 503\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This is a writ of error to the court of appeals of the state of Maryland, to review its judgment affirming that of the circuit court for Montgomery county, which affirmed the proceedings of the board of registry of election district No. 7 of that county, \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 622]\n\u00a0\n refusing to register petitioner as a legal voter on the ground of his noncompliance with the Maryland law making it necessary for a person coming into the state, with the intention of residing therein, to register his name with the clerk of the circuit court of the proper county, and thereby to indicate the intent of such person to become a citizen and resident of the state.\n The act in question was passed March 29, 1902, as chapter 133 of the laws of that year, and as an amendment and supplement to the Public General Laws of the State, title Elections, subtitle Registration, as  25 b, and it is reproduced in the margin. \n Plaintiff in error on September 29, 1903, presented his ap- \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 623]\n\u00a0\n plication to the board of registry of election district No. 7, Montgomery county, Maryland, then sitting at a place within such district, to be registered and entered as a qualified voter on the registry of voters of that election district, which application the board refused and declined to comply with, for the sole reason that he had not complied with this law of Maryland. Thereafter the plaintiff presented a sworn petition to the circuit court for Montgomery county, in the state of Maryland, praying that court to enter an order to revise the action of the board of registry, and to order and direct that the name of the petitioner should be entered as a qualified voter on the registry of voters of the election district already named. In that sworn petition he alleged that he had, on June 7, 1902, with his wife and child, removed from the city of Washington, District of Columbia, into Montgomery county, in the state of Maryland, 'having then had, and ever since and now having, the intention of making the state of Maryland the permanent domicil of himself and his family, and of becoming a citizen of said state; and ever since said June 7, 1902, petitioner has resided in the subdivision of Otterbourne, near Chevy Chase, in said Montgomery county, and in the seventh election district of said county.'\n The petitioner further showed in his petition that he had made application to the proper board of registry in the election district mentioned, and the board had refused to enter his name as a qualified voter on the ground already stated, of noncompliance with the Maryland statute.\n The petitioner admitted 'that he did not, within a year prior to said application for registration as a qualified voter, or at any time during the year 1902, in any manner make or register, in the office of or before the clerk of Montgomery county, Maryland, or in a record book kept by said clerk, a declaration of intention to become a citizen and resident of Maryland, such as is required by the aforesaid law to be made by persons who remove into the state of Maryland after March 29, 1902, as a condition precedent to subsequent regis- \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 624]\n\u00a0\n tration of such persons as qualified voters. Petitioner, however, claims and asserts that said  25b of article 33 of the Code of Public General Laws of Maryland affords no justification for said refusal to register your petitioner as a qualified voter, because said alleged law contravenes and is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Maryland, and is, therefore, null and void.'\n The petitioner then asserts and sets forth in his petition several grounds which, as he therein alleges, render the state law a violation of the Constitution of the State of Maryland, and he also specially sets up and claims that the law is a violation of the Constitution of the United States in the particulars named by him, and which are as follows:\n'Said law is repugnant to that portion of  1 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that, 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside,' because by said law it is in effect ordained that male citizens of the United States of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, removing into the state of Maryland after March 29, 1902, with the intention of making said state their permanent domicil, shall not be treated as citizens or residents of Maryland, or given the rights and privileges of citizens of Maryland, until they have been naturalized in the mode prescribed by said law.\n\n'Said law is also repugnant to that portion of  1 of said 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which prohibits a state from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, because said law operates an unjust and unreasonable discrimination against citizens of the United States coming into the state of Maryland to permanently reside therein after March 29, 1902, who may desire to become qualified voters therein.\n\n'Said law is also repugnant to the general spirit of the Constitution of the United States and the fundamental rights \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 625]\n\u00a0\n of citizens of the United States, which deny to a state the power to attach unreasonable or burdensome conditions to the free movement of citizens of the United States out of, into, and settlement within, the confines of any state, district, or territory within the United States.'\n\n To this petition there was a general demurrer, which was sustained by the court, which thereupon entered judgment dismissing the petition, with costs to the defendants.\n Mr. William H. Pope in propria persona for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 621, 627]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Prentiss Poe and Bowie F. Waters for defendants in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 621, 631]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n This is not a case of a statute of the state having been passed subsequently to the time when the individual had removed from another state or from a territory or from the District of Columbia into the state of Maryland. There is, therefore, no alteration of any possible rights which the plaintiff in error might have already acquired and which he might claim were taken from him by the passage of such statute. On the contrary, this statute took effect on March 29, 1902, more than two months prior to the removal of the plaintiff in error from Washington in the District of Columbia to Montgomery county, within the state of Maryland. The objections of a Federal nature which are made by the plaintiff in error to the validity of the statute are set out in his petition, and are \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 632]\n\u00a0\n also contained in the above statement of facts, and are substantially reproduced in his assignment of errors.\n We are of opinion that the statute does not violate any Federal right of the plaintiff in error which he seeks to assert in this proceeding. The statute, so far as it concerns him and the right which he urges, is one making regulations and conditions for the registry of persons for the purpose of voting. It was only for the purpose of thereafter voting that the plaintiff in error sought to be registered, and it was the denial of that right only which he can now review. His application for registry as a voter was denied by the board of registry solely because of his failure to comply with the statute. Whatever other right he may have as a citizen of Maryland by reason of his removal there with an intent to become such citizen is not now in question. So far as appears no other right, if any he may have, has been infringed by the statute. The simple matter to be herein determined is whether, with reference to the exercise of the privilege of voting in Maryland, the legislature of that state had the legal right to provide that a person coming into the state to reside should make the declaration of intent a year before he should have the right to be registered as a voter of the state.\n The privilege to vote in any state is not given by the Federal Constitution, or by any of its amendments. It is not a privilege springing from citizenship of the United States. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 22 L. ed. 627. It may not be refused on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, but it does not follow from mere citizenship of the United States. In other words, the privilege to vote in a state is within the jurisdiction of the state itself, to be exercised as the state may direct, and upon such terms as to it may seem proper, provided, of course, no discrimination is made between individuals, in violation of the Federal Constitution. The state might provide that persons of foreign birth could vote without being naturalized, and, as stated by Mr. Chief Justice Waite in Miner v. Happersett, 21 Wall, 162, 22 L. ed. 627, such persons were allowed to vote in several of the \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 633]\n\u00a0\n states upon having declared their intentions to become citizens of the United States. Some states permit women to vote; others refuse them that privilege. A state, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, might provide by its own constitution and laws that none but native-born citizens should be permitted to vote, as the Federal Constitution does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one, and the conditions under which that right is to be exercised are matters for the states alone to prescribe, subject to the conditions of the Federal Constitution, already stated; although it may be observed that the right to vote for a member of Congress is not derived exclusively from the state law. See Fed. Const. art. 1,  2; Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 U.S. 58\n, 45 L. ed. 84, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17. But the elector must be one entitled to vote under the state statute. Id., Id. See also Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487, 491\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1005, 1007, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783. In this case no question arises as to the right to vote for electors of President and Vice President, and no decision is made thereon. The question whether the conditions prescribed by the state might be regarded by others as reasonable or unreasonable is not a Federal one. We do not wish to be understood, however, as intimating that the condition in this statute is unreasonable or in any way improper.\n We are unable to see any violation of the Federal Constitution in the provision of the state statute for the declaration of the intent of a person coming into the state before he can claim the right to be registered as a voter. The statute, so far as it provides conditions precedent to the exercise of the elective franchise within the state, by persons coming therein to reside (and that is as far as it is necessary to consider it in this case), is neither an unlawful discrimination against any one in the situation of the plaintiff in error nor does it deny to him the equal protection of the laws, nor is it repugnant to any fundamental or inalienable rights of citizens of the United States, nor a violation of any implied guaranties of the Federal Constitution. The right of a state to legislate upon the subject of the elective franchise as to it may seem good, sub- \n\n[193 U.S. 621, 634]\n\u00a0\n ject to the conditions already stated, being, as we believe, unassailable, we think it plain that the statute in question violates no right protected by the Federal Constitution.\n The reasons which may have impelled the state legislature to enact the statute in question were matters entirely for its consideration, and this court has no concern with them.\n It is unnecessary in this case to assert that under no conceivable state of facts could a state statute in regard to voting be regarded as an infringement upon or a discrimination against, the individual rights of a citizen of the United States removing into the state, and excluded from voting therein by state legislation. The question might arise if an exclusion from the privilege of voting were founded upon the particular state from which the person came, excluding from that privilege, for instance, a citizen of the United States coming from Georgia and allowing it to a citizen of the United States coming from New York or any other state. In such case an argument might be urged that, under the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution, the citizen from Georgia was, by the state statute, deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Other of the equal protection of the laws. Other extreme cases might be suggested. We neither assert nor deny that, in the case supposed, the claim would be well founded that a Federal right of a citizen of the United States was violated by such legislation, for the question does not arise herein. We do, however, hold that there is nothing in the statute in question which violated the Federal rights of the plaintiff in error by virtue of the provision for making a declaration of his intention to become a citizen before he can have the right to be registered as a voter and to vote in the state.\n The plaintiff in error has no ground for complaint in regard to the decision of the courts below, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is therefore affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 25b.

Rep. 204.\n By the plaintiff's statement of its claim against the defendant, the telegraph company, it sought to recover from the company the sum of $220. 50, including interest from January 31, 1898. \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n The defendant is a corporation engaged in interstate commerce by transmitting telegraphic communications among the several states, and by its affidavit of defense it averred that it was a company engaged in forwarding telegraphic dispatches among the several states, and was a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York; that it had paid the commonwealth of Pennsylvania all taxes which had by legislative enactment been levied upon the value of its poles and wires erected and maintained in the borough of Taylor and elsewhere in the state; that it had accepted the act of Congress (14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230), providing for the construction of telegraph lines over any post road of the United States; that it had never maintained, and does not now maintain, any office whatever in the borough of Taylor, and that no telegraphic business of any kind is done or transacted by the defendant in that borough, except the maintenance of the telegraphic lines and the transmission of telegraphic messages over the same from other places; that the ordinance in question is unreasonable, unjust, and excessive, and is illegal and void, because it is designed and intended to provide revenue by taxation for the general expenses of the borough, and that no other object than this exists, or has at any time existed, for the regulations imposed by the ordinance; that the borough is under no expense whatever in issuing the license required by the ordinance, and has not been at any time before, during, or after the period mentioned in the plaintiff's statement for which it makes demand, under any expense or charge of any kind whatsoever in inspecting and regulating the poles and wires; that the license fees imposed by the ordinance are not based upon the cost and expense to the borough for inspection and supervision or regulation of the defendant's lines and business, but the fees are imposed notwithstanding they are more than twenty times the amount that might have been or could possibly be incidental to such inspection, supervision, and regulation, together with all reasonable measures and precautions that might have been or possibly could be required to be taken by \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n the said borough for the safety of its citizens and the public, or which might have been or possibly could be incurred as expenses for the most careful, thorough, and efficient inspection and supervision that might have been made of the poles and wires of the defendant, although the plaintiff has not and does not maintain any inspection and supervision or care whatsoever over the poles and wires of the defendant, and has incurred no expense whatever on account thereof; that the borough is a sparsely populated district, and the land therein of small value, and most of the land along the highway on which the telegraph lines are constructed is not adapted to building purposes nor commercial use, and the highway is little traveled; that the borough is a coal-mining community and the buildings therein consist for the most part of the coal miners' cabins or houses of one or two stories, and the business buildings are scattered and consist mostly of small shops or stores; that the poles and wires thereon are located on the side of the highway and do not interfere in the slightest degree or to any extent with its use for all highway purposes, and do not interfere with any kind of traffic or with the operation of men or apparatus in extinguishing fires; that the line is not old, decayed, or worn out, but, on the contrary, is comparatively new and sound, and there is no danger of accident from the decay or breaking down of the poles and wires; that the license fees imposed by the ordinance are twenty times more than could be imposed under any power existing in the borough to make charges for all legal purposes; that the amount of the license fees imposed under the ordinance for each year largely exceeds the entire cost to the defendant itself of maintaining said line, including all repairs, reconstruction, cost of labor and material, and traveling expenses of the employees, and all expenses incurred by the defendant by a careful and efficient inspection and maintenance of such poles and wires; that the fees imposed by the ordinance are so excessive that if every borough in the state of Pennsylvania in which defendant has a telegraph system should pass similar ordinances the total amount collected \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n would exceed $100,000 per annum, and if the same kind of an ordinance should be passed in the other states by the municipalities in which the poles and lines of the company are placed it could not pay the amount, but would become insolvent by reason of the fact that the expenses of operation, including the license fees, would be far in excess of the receipts of the defendant.\n To this affidavit of defense the plaintiff excepted on the ground that it did not state any sufficient defense to plaintiff's cause of action, and also on the ground of res judicata, in that the same questions had been theretofore decided between the same parties in the courts of the state.\n A rule for judgment was taken by the plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and, upon hearing, the rule was made absolute (the facts set forth in the affidavit of defense being thereby assumed), and judgment for the plaintiff being entered, it was affirmed by the superior and supreme courts of Pennsylvania.\n Mr. Frank R. Shattuck for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John M. Harris and E. O. Wagenhorst for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The grounds of our jurisdiction to review the judgment in this and the preceding case are similar to those which sustained it in the two cases of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. New Hope, \n187 U.S. 419\n, 47 L. ed. 240, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204, and Atlantic & Pacific Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 45 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817. By reference to the opinions delivered in the state courts in this case it is apparent that it was not decided upon any question of res judicata, as set forth in the plaintiff's exceptions to defendant's affidavit of defense. \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n In the opinion of the superior court of Pennsylvania it was stated:\n'Whether or not the fee is so obviously excessive as to lead irresistibly to the conclusion that it is exacted as a return for the use of the streets, or is imposed for revenue purposes, is a question for the courts, and is to be determined upon a view of the facts, not upon evidence consisting of the opinions of witnesses as to the proper supervision that the municipal authorities might properly exercise, and the expense of the same. Such a decision becomes a precedent which is to be regarded in other cases similarly situated. Were it to be held otherwise, the law upon the subject would be in hopeless confusion and uncertainty. We make these remarks because we cannot escape the conclusion that some of the averments of the affidavit of defense are, in reality, but the opinion of the defendant, undoubtedly honestly entertained, as to these matters. They are not stronger than the averments in Philadelphia v. American U. Teleg. Co. 167 Pa. 406, 31 Atl. 628, and the other facts averred do not distinguish the case from others in which a similar fee in boroughs has been held to be not so obviously excessive as to warrant the courts in declaring the ordinance void. The cases are collected in the opinion filed herewith in the case of New Hope v. Western U. Teleg. Co. 202 Pa. 532, 52 Atl. 127.' [Reported in 202 Pa. 583, 52 Atl. 128.]\n\n The opinion referred to by the superior court is also contained in the record, and cases were cited in that opinion from the state courts holding that they would not declare an ordinance void because of the alleged unreasonableness of the fee charged, unless the unreasonableness be so clearly apparent as to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the municipal authorities. The court further remarked:\n'In many of the foregoing cases the license fee was the same as that imposed by the ordinance under consideration. In none of the cases was the ordinance declared void for unreasonableness, although it was inferentially conceded that a case might arise where the license fee would be so grossly dispro- \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n portioned to the burden imposed upon the municipality in consequence of the erection and maintenance of the poles and wires as to warrant the court in presuming that the ordinance was a revenue measure, not a police regulation. None of the cases laid down a fixed and invariable rule by which that question is to be determined, but after a comparison of the facts developed on the trial of this case with the facts of some of the cases above cited, we have been led to the conclusion that the court would not have been justified by the precedents in declaring the ordinance void.'\n\n Upon the averments in the affidavit of defense, which in this proceeding must be taken to be true, we can come to no other conclusion than that the ordinance was void because of the unreasonable amount of the license fee provided for therein.\n It was urged on the argument that this ordinance was a proper police regulation, and that the collection of revenue was not its object; that it was the duty of the borough officials to protect the lives and property of its citizens, and that in the discharge of such duty it had the right to constantly inspect the poles and wires for the purpose of seeing that they were safe.\n There is no doubt that, for the purpose mentioned, the borough had the right claimed by its counsel. The averments of the affidavit of defense, however, show that no such duty has been discharged or attempted to be discharged by the borough. It has done absolutely nothing to protect the lives or property of its citizens by inspecting the poles and wires of the defendant.\n In Atlantic & Pacific Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817, it was held that the testimony in a case like this might be such as to compel a decision one way or the other, and the court might then be justified in directing a verdict. We think this is one of those cases. We assume that a tax of this kind ought to be large enough to cover all expenses of police supervision of the property and instrumentalities used by the company in the borough, and that it is not bound to furnish such super- \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n vision for nothing, but may, in addition to ordinary property taxation, subject the corporation to a charge for the expenses of the supervision. The borough is also not compelled to make its expenditures for these purposes in advance of demanding the tax from the defendant, but it must be remembered that such a tax is authorized only in support of police supervision; and, if it were possible to prove in advance the exact cost, that sum would be the limit of the law. As, in the nature of things, this is ordinarily impossible, the municipality is at liberty to make the charge enough to cover any reasonably anticipated expenses, and the payment of the fee cannot be avoided because it may subsequently appear that it was somewhat in excess of the actual expense of the supervision, nor can the company then recover the difference between the amount of the license fee and such cost. These observations are substantially reproduced from the opinion of the court in Atlantic & Pacific Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817, delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer.\n We come, then, to an examination of the question whether this fee, in the light of the admitted facts set forth in the affidavit of defense, can, by the widest stretch of imagination, be regarded as reasonable. The borough is, where the poles are planted and the wires stretched, sparsely settled, and the danger to be apprehended from neglect in regard to the poles and wires is reduced to a minimum. The borough has in fact done nothing in the way of inspection or supervision during the time covered by the license in question. It has not expended one dollar for any such purpose. It has incurred no liability to pay any expenses arising from inspection or supervision on its behalf. The fee itself is twenty times the amount of expense that might have been reasonably and fairly incurred to make the most careful, thorough, and efficient inspection and supervision that might have been made of such poles and wires, and for all reasonable measures and precautions that possibly could be required to be taken by the borough for the safety of its citizens and the public. This is not a mere ex- \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n pression of opinion. It is the averment of a fact. The company knows the amount it costs for the inspection, which it avers is made by its own servants, and which it avers is a most careful and efficient inspection, one intended to place and maintain the poles and wires in a perfectly safe and satisfactory condition. Knowing that cost, and comparing it with the amount demanded under the ordinance, it is enabled to state as a fact, and not as a mere opinion, that the amount of the license fee exacted under the ordinance is, as stated, twenty times more than it ought to be to secure a reasonable, efficient, and most careful inspection, as set forth in the affidavit mentioned.\n In Chester City v. Western U. Teleg. Co. 154 Pa. 464, 25 Atl. 1134, cited in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. New Hope, \n187 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 47 S. L. ed. 240, 244, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204, it was said that the affidavit in that case averred that the rates charged were at least five times the amount of the expenses involved in the supervision exercised by the municipality. The supreme court held that while that averment must be admitted to be true, it did not go far enough, because it referred only to the usual, ordinary, and necessary expenses of the municipal officers in issuing the license and other expenses thereby imposed upon the municipality, and that it made no reference to the liability imposed upon the city by the erection of the telegraph poles. It was also stated by the court that it is the duty of the city to see that the poles are safe and properly maintained, and should a citizen be injured in person or property by reason of the neglect of such duty an action might lie against the city for the consequences of such neglect. The court said it was a mistake, therefore, to measure the reasonableness of the charge by the amount actually expended by the city in a particular year to the particular purposes specified in the affidavit.\n The affidavit in this case goes much further. It includes not only the expenses that might have been incurred for an ordinary inspection, supervision, and regulation, but takes into account the very matters that are spoken of in the extract from \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n the opinion of the supreme court of Pennsylvania (supra). Instead of the averment that the license fee charged was at least five times the amount of the expense involved in the supervision exercised by the municipality, it is stated that it is more than twenty times the amount that would reasonably be expended for the purposes stated in the affidavit.\n The liability to pay for injuries that might arise from the bad condition of the poles and wires, arising from the neglect of the company to inspect and supervise the same, is not a liability which the municipality is entitled to recover from the company in advance of its happening, but it is simply one of the reasons for an inspection by the borough, which shall be most carefully and continuously performed, in order that injuries may not arise from the neglect of such supervision.\n When we come to an examination of the grounds upon which this kind of a tax is justifiable, and when we find that, in this case, each one of those grounds is absent. how is it possible to uphold the validity of such an ordinance? To uphold it in such a case as this is to say that it may be passed for one purpose and used for another; passed as a police inspection measure and used for the purpose of raising revenue; that the enactment as a police measure may be used as a mere subterfuge for the purpose of raising revenue, and yet, because it is said to be an inspection measure, the court must take it as such and hold it valid, although resulting in a rate of taxation which, if carried out throughout the country, would bankrupt the company were it added to the other taxes properly assessed for revenue and paid by the company. It is thus to be declared legal upon a basis and for a reason that do not exist in fact.\n We think the court is not bound to acknowledge an ordinance such as this to be valid in face of the facts stated in the affidavit of defense. Confessedly there has been here no inspection, no expense incurred to provide for one even though not made, and all expenses and liabilities that might fairly and reasonably be incurred on the part of the borough are not one-twentieth of the amount it exacts for an inspection which it has not made. \n\n[192 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n Under such facts it would seem to be plain that the ordinance was adopted as a means for the raising of revenue, and not to repay expenses for inspection. Judging the intention of the borough by its action, it did not intend to expend anything for an inspection of the poles and wires, and did intend to raise revenue under the ordinance. Courts are not to be deceived by the mere phraseology in which the ordinance is couched, when the action of the borough, in the light of the facts set forth in the affidavit, shows conclusively that it was not passed to repay the expenses or provide for the liabilities incurred in the way of inspection of for proper supervision.\n We are of opinion that, upon the averments contained in the defendant's statement of defense, the defendant was entitled to judgment. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is, therefore, reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Brewer dissented. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSTAL TELEGRAPH-CABLE CO. v. BOROUGH OF NEW HOPE(1904)\nNo. 92\nArgued: December 11, 1903Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The borough of New Hope in January, 1899, commenced an action against the telegraph company, the plaintiff in error herein, to recover from it the sum of $552, with interest from the respective times in which portions of the amounts became due, the total charges being due from the defendant, as alleged, on account of a license fee taxed by the borough (by virtue of an ordinance to that effect) of $1 for each pole and of $2.50 for each mile of wire used in the borough by the company, the license to be applied for and the fee to be paid annually.\n The company made what is termed in the record an affidavit of defense, which, among other things, averred that it was a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York, and had accepted the act of Congress, approved July 24, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230, relating to the construction of telegraph lines over any post road of the United States), and that its poles and wires through the borough of New Hope were employed and operated in the transmission of messages between the different states, and were therefore instruments of commerce; that the amount of the charges claimed to be due from the defendant under the ordinance was unreasonable, unjust, and excessive; that the fee was sought to be justified as a license merely, but that the amount thereof was wholly disproportionate to the usual, ordinary, and necessary expenses of inspecting and supervising the poles and wires imposed upon the borough of New Hope, and was largely in excess thereof, and the fee was also largely in excess of any additional liability of that kind and character imposed upon the borough in looking after the safety of the poles and wires and to see that they were properly maintained, and was also in excess of any further liability which might or could arise to the borough by reason of any injuries \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n to persons or property which might arise, or may have arisen, by reason of the erection of the poles and the stringing of the wires within the limits of the borough. It was further stated that the charges were more than ten times the amount of all kinds and character of expenses and liability which might have been incurred by the borough by reason of these poles and wires, and that, in view of those circumstances, the assessing of the license tax upon the telegraph company was for the purpose of raising and producing revenue, and was therefore void.\n The company averred that it had paid the commonwealth of Pennsylvania all taxes upon the value of its poles and wires, as included in and represented by its capital and upon the gross receipts derived from the use thereof, and it had paid its taxes upon its property in the borough of New Hope. That the expenses incurred by the borough during the period covered by the claim practically amounted to nothing, so far as regarded inspection and supervision.\n The parties proceeded to trial, and the borough having proved the passage of the ordinance, and the number of poles and the number of miles of wire as claimed in the complaint, thereupon rested.\n The defendant proved that the only work done by the employees of the borough in regard to the poles and wires of the company during the four years included in the claim was to count the poles each year for the purpose of assessing the tax; that no other service on the part of the borough was performed under its police powers, or at all, in regard to inspection. The defendant also showed that it was an interstate telegraph company; that it had no public office in the borough, nor had there been any commercial office therein during the time in question; that there was no office in which business was received for which tolls were charged.\n It was proved, also, that the entire value of the line of the company in the borough of New Hope (that is, the cost of the material and construction) amounted to less than $800, and \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n that the claim of the borough, graduated by the number of poles in the borough and the number of miles of wire strung on them, amounted to $138 per year, or to 17 per centum of the cost of the line in the borough.\n The company also proved that it employed servants, whose duty is was to erect the poles, and string the wires, and inspect and watch them, and keep them in proper repair and in safe condition; that the authorities of the borough did nothing whatever in the way of inspection of the lines.\n The trial judge charged the jury, among other things, that the question which arose in the evidence in the case was that of the validity of the ordinance, to be determined by the amount and character of the charges against the company; that the borough had the right to enact such police regulations as might be necessary and reasonable in the government of the town, but in regard to the taxing question it had no right to go beyond the exercise of what was termed its police power; that if the ordinance was unreasonable in amount, it was void; that the power to demand the license fee must be exercised as a means of regulation, and cannot be used as a source of revenue, and that, when exacted as a police power, it must be limited to the necessary and proper expenses of issuing the license and of inspecting and regulating the business the license covers; that the borough had the right to impose such conditions and regulations as are necessary for the general protection of the streets and the uses of the same in the borough; that in doing this the borough could not be questioned, provided the license fee was a reasonable and just one, and a proper one under the circumstances, and commensurate with the probable requirements and exercise of the police or supervisory power of the borough. The court then said that it had a great deal of doubt as matter of fact and law as to whether this was a reasonable subjection or not, and it was frank to say:\n'That we are inclined to the view that this is an arbitrary imposition of a license or tax rate. But it appears that our \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n brethren upon the bench in other localities have adjudged that similar rates are not unreasonable or unnecessary; but it is argued upon the part of the defense that in those cases there was not the same proof as has been developed here. There was not shown as clearly as there is here that the amount of money received as the result of the license was a clear revenue, irrespective of any requirement for police regulation. In other words, that this borough seems to have imposed a license fee to be expended and used in the exercise of a power and a duty which it has failed to exercise at all. Now then, gentlemen, while the question as to whether an ordinance is reasonable or not is for the court, and the court does not propose to evade that question, yet I have concluded to obtain the assistance and judgment of this jury as to whether an assessment, such as this is, under the circumstances of this case, is reasonable or unreasonable under the law, as I have laid it down, for this surely involves the facts. Now, if you believe that it is unreasonable according to the facts, you will render a verdict for the defendant; if you believe that it is reasonable and should be paid in the full amount, you will render a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of its claim, and the court hereafter will regulate judgment in accordance with such views, either upon a motion for a new trial or otherwise, as we shall entertain after having this opinion from you, in aid of its judgment, and to determine the doubt on the facts.'\n\n The court further stated:\n'The borough of New Hope had no right to impose any charge for the privilege of erecting and maintaining said poles and wires in said borough except only such sum as will reasonably cover and reimburse to it the expense to it which it may be subjected in consequence of the erection and maintenance of said poles and wires, and if the license fees sued for in this case exceed said sum, your verdict shall be for the defendant.'\n\n Instead of finding a verdict for the amount due under the ordinance, or else a verdict for the defendant, as directed by \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n the court, the jury on October 17, 1899, found a verdict for $466.40. The trial judge directed judgment to be entered for the borough for the amount of the verdict. From that judgment an appeal was taken by the company to the superior court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed the same, that court holding that, the facts being undisputed, the question of the validity of the ordinance was for the court to decide, and that if, on the undisputed facts, the court would not have been warranted in declaring the ordinance void, the submission of the question of its reasonableness to the jury was an error of which the defendant had no just right to complain, and the court held that it would not have been justified by the precedents in declaring the ordinance void.\n The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the superior court, and upon the question that the verdict of the jury was for a less sum than the ordinance called for, said that was a matter of which, under the view of the law taken by the court (that the question of reasonableness was for it ), the plaintiff might complain, but that it was such good luck for the defendant that it might well rest satisfied. The company thereupon sued out this writ of error.\n Mr. Frank R. Shattuck for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William C. Ryan for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The ground upon which an ordinance of this nature may be upheld is stated in the two cases of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. New Hope, \n187 U.S. 419\n, 47 L. ed. 240, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204, and Atlantic & P. Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817.\n The trial court held that the question whether the ordinance in this case was reasonable or not was one for the court, but he submitted it to the jury for their aid, and as advisory only, the \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n court stating to the jury that it would thereafter regulate the judgment to be entered in accordance with such views as the court might entertain as to the reasonableness of the ordinance, and after having the benefit of the assistance of the jury upon that question.\n The direction to the jury was to give a verdict for the full sum, if they thought that the ordinance was reasonable, and if not,-that is, if the jury thought that the ordinance was not reasonable,-then the verdict should be for the defendant. The jury did not obey that direction. It returned a verdict for a considerably less sum than was due if the ordinance were valid, and by such verdict (regard being had to the charge of the judge) it necessarily found the license fee provided for in the ordinance was unreasonable and the ordinance itself invalid. The verdict is, therefore, simply evidence of what the jury conceived to be a reasonable sum, which it thereupon proceeded to assess by its verdict, and being much less than the ordinance called for. It made itself a taxing body, the verdict being the result of its own views as to what the fees should have been. When the verdict was rendered, and the court directed judgment to be entered thereon, it must have thereby concurred with the jury, and held the ordinance unreasonable and therefore void. Otherwise, if the ordinance was valid, the court would have directed judgment for the full sum, without reference to the verdict. Finding, therefore, that the ordinance was void, instead of directing judgment for the defendant, the court followed the jury, and directed judgment for the sum which the court regarded as reasonable, being the same sum found by the jury. This follows, because the court had theretofore stated that, in its view, this ordinance was an arbitrary imposition of a license tax, and the court also announced that the verdict of the jury was not conclusive, and would be acted upon by him in accordance with such views as he might entertain after the verdict was rendered. But neither the court nor the jury had any power whatever to give judgment for what either might regard a reasonable sum, if that \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n sum were less than the amount provided for in the ordinance. The source of jurisdiction to give any verdict or judgment for the plaintiff was the ordinance. If the amount of the license fee provided for therein was unreasonable, the ordinance was void, and there was no power in either jury or court to substitute its own judgment as to what was reasonable, and to give a verdict or direct a judgment to be entered for that sum. Finding the sum named in the ordinance unreasonable, the verdict or judgment should have been for the defendant.\n The argument that plaintiff alone can complain that the verdict is too small is not well founded in this instance. It is undoubtedly the general rule that a verdict or judgment for a less sum for the plaintiff than he is entitled to under the evidence is matter of complaint for him alone, and if acquiesced in by him the defendant has no cause to complain that he is charged for a less sum than he ought to have been. On grounds already stated the reasons do not apply in a case like this.\n Both the superior and the supreme courts of Pennsylvania proceeded in their decisions upon the theory that the question was for the court, and that the ordinance was valid; but as the jury had found a less sum than provided for by the ordinance, the judgment might stand, and the defendant could not in such event complain that the judgment was too small. Those courts in effect reverse the finding of the jury that the ordinance was unreasonable and void, while at the same time maintaining a judgment based upon such finding.\n In Western U. Teleg. Co. v. New Hope, \n187 U.S. 419\n, 47 L. ed. 240, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204, the question of the reasonableness of the license fee exacted was left to the jury, and the jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment was rendered thereon, which was affirmed by the state courts upon appeal. Upon writ of error from this court the case was reviewed here, and it was held that, as the jury and the court of common pleas, the superior court, and the supreme court of Pennsylvania had all held the ordinance reasonable, this court would \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n not say it was so manifestly wrong as to justify our interposition.\n There is a difference, however, between such a case and one like this, where the jury and the trial court have, in effect, held the ordinance void, and a judgment has been entered which is unauthorized in any event, and which should have been for the defendant. Where it is a question of amount in an ordinance in a case like this, we have held that it is not improper to submit that question to a jury, although in general the reasonableness of an ordinance is matter of law for the court. Atlantic & P. Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817.\n In the case cited it was stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, at page 166, L. ed. p. 1001, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 819, as follows:\n'It may be conceded that, generally speaking, whether an ordinance be reasonable is a question for the court. As said by Judge Dillon, in his work on Municipal Corporations, 4th ed. vol. 1,  327: 'Whether an ordinance be reasonable and consistent with the law or not is a question for the court, and not the jury, and evidence to the latter on this subject is inadmissible.' While that may be correct as a general statement of the law, and especially in cases in which the question of reasonableness turns on the character of the regulations prescribed, yet when it turns on the amount of a license charge it may rightly be left for the determination of a jury. There are many matters which enter into the consideration of such a question, not infrequently matters which are disputed, and in respect to which there is contradictory testimony.'\n\n We think that in this case, like that just cited, it was not improper to submit the question to the jury, and that the verdict necessarily found the license fee exacted by the ordinance unreasonable, and the ordinance itself was therefore void. The jury could not itself assess a tax and render verdict for the amount it might judge reasonable. A judgment entered upon such a verdict for the amount thereof was improper and illegal, as it should have been for the defendant, the ordinance being void. \n\n[192 U.S. 55, 64]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania should be reversed and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Brewer dissented. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC CLEARING HOUSE v. COYNE(1904)\nNo. 224\nArgued: April 18, 1904Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n This was a bill in equity by the Public Clearing House against the postmaster of the city of Chicago, praying for an injunction to restrain him from seizing and detaining appellant's mail, stamping it 'fraudulent,' and returning it to the senders thereof, and from denying to appellant the use of the money order and registered-letter system of the Postoffice Department.\n An answer and replication were filed, and the cause referred to a master in chancery to take the testimony, and report the same with his conclusions thereon.\n The following contains the substance of the master's report:\n'1. The complainant is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Illinois, for the purpose, as stated by its charter, of doing a general brokerage and commission business, collecting and disbursing money, and conducting an exchange or information bureau for the benefit of patrons. The evidence shows that the said complainant had made a beginning of several different kinds of business, and its managers had opened negotiations with different laundry proprietors, preparing to place laundries on a co-operative basis; also to handle fruits and poultry in the same manner, and also to purchase and sell goods on behalf of its patrons, on commission, and to exchange goods in specie in the same manner for a commission, \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n and had actually transacted some small amount of such business; but the principal business and object for which the said complainant was organized appears to have been to act as the fiscal agent of a certain voluntary association called the League of Equity. This League of Equity consists of a large number of people, approximately 5,000 at present, of various occupations, and scattered throughout the United States and Cannada, each of whom, in his application for membership, consents that the Public Clearing House shall act as fiscal agent for said League of Equity. The said League of Equity was in a way successor to a prior organization called the League of Educators, and this in turn succeeded to a still prior organization called the League of Eligibles, and a certain organization or partnership called the board of managers of the League of Educators and the board of managers of the League of Eligibles were respectively fiscal agents for the two organizations.\n\n'The League of Eligibles was established in the year 1898, and was a voluntary association of unmarried people. Their certificates became matured or realized upon the contingency of marriage, provided that such marriage did not occur within one year from the time when they joined the league. The certificate had a fixed realization value of $500 and was paid out of the monthly pro rata assessment levied upon all members of the league for the benefit of those members whose certificates were matured or realized.\n\n'The plan of the League of Educators was the same, except that it substituted a fixed time for the realization of the certificates, and eliminated the marriage contingency feature.\n\n'2. The plan of the League of Equity differed from that of the League of Educators only in having a fixed monthly payment of $1, instead of a fluctuating or variable assessment. When the first change was made there were about 1,300 members of the League of Eligibles, all of whom were given an opportunity to become members of the League of Educators without additional cost and without \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n losing the benefit of their previous term of co-operation, and many of them availed themselves of this opportunity and became members of the League of Educators. Again, when the League of Equity was formed, the League of Educators consisted of some 9,000 members, who were allowed the same privilege of joining the League of Equity, and up to the time when the fraud order was issued against the latter concern, between 4,000 and 5, 000 members of the League of Educators had joined the League of Equity.\n\n'3. The evidence showed that up to about the first of November, 1902, during the period of the existence of the League of Eligibles and League of Educators, there had been collected from about 13,784 members a total of $137,390.66, out of which the board of managers had taken about $36,000 for their expenses and compensation for themselves and agents in the field. The remainder had been distributed among some 600 or 700 members, and at that time the board of managers had no money in their hands.\n\n'In other words, 600 or 700 members had received an average of something less than $170 each, and over 10,000 members had received nothing.\n\n'4. The board of managers of the League of Educators had, during its business as fiscal agent for said league, accumulated a large number of address cards of different persons throughout the country, which had been secured through the members or co-operators, and these address cards were, at or about the time of the organization of the Public Clearing House, sold to said Public Clearing House by the said board of managers, for the sum of $2,500.\n\n'5. The complainant, The Public Clearing House, as such fiscal agent of the League of Equity; invites people to join the said league, and holds out inducements in the shape of a large return for small amounts of money and for services to be rendered by members or co-operators in inducing others to become members or co-operators. There is no contract or agreement issued or entered into with members by the League of Equity \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n itself as a body or association, but a certain so-called co-operator's agreement, a copy of which is attached to the bill herein, is issued to each member or co-operator, and is signed by said Public Clearing House by its president and secretary as fiscal agents for the League of Equity.\n\n'In order to carry on successfully the business of the complainant it is necessary that it have the use of the United States mails; but it has not had the use of the mails since November 13, 1902, by reason of a 'fraud order' issued against it, dated November 10, 1902, by the Postmaster General, and as a result the business has practically been stopped.\n\n'6. The plan or scheme of the League of Equity as set forth in the co- operator's agreement and in other literature issued by said complainant may be briefly stated as follows: Each person who becomes a member or co- operator pays $3 as enrolment fee, and agrees to pay the sum of $1 per month for sixty months or five years, and also agrees to 'co-operate' by inducing other persons to become members or co-operators. The agreement states that in consideration of said enrolment fee 'and the faithful compliance with the terms of this agreement hereinafter contained, the above-named person shall receive his pro rata share of the total amount realized (less 10 per cent) when entitled to a realization, as hereinafter provided, said realization to be in accordance with the following ordinary causation and realization table.' Then follows a table showing that if the league grows at the rate of fifteen to one, the total realization of the member at the end of five years will be at the same rate of increase,-that is, he will receive $900 for his $60 paid in; if the growth is at the rate of ten to one he will receive $600 at the end of five years, and so forth and so on down to a growth of only one to one, in which case he will receive only his money back, less the 10 per cent which is in each case deducted as the compensation of the complainant for its services and existence as fiscal agent, and less also the $3 enrolment fee. Aside from this \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n 10 per cent and the $3 enrolment fee, the plan does not contemplate that complainant shall retain any of the money paid in by co-operators, or that any reserve fund shall be accumulated or invested, but that the money paid in each month shall be regularly paid out each month (less 10 per cent) to the so-called realizing co-operators, i. e., those whose five years' period has expired and who have continued to make the requisite monthly payments during said five years. There is an additional provision that each co-operator who shall have secured three new members in any one year may realize or receive at the end of each year one fifth of the amount which he would be entitled to receive at the end of five years, assuming that the growth for the five years continued at the same rate; but the plan contemplates that in the end the member who secures new members and the one who does not shall receive the same amount.\n\n'7. All members who join the League of Equity during the same month constitute a class by themselves, and are entitled to realize in all respects precisely the same amount, and at the same time, excepting the member who obtains new co-operators may receive his realization in yearly instalments, instead of in one lump at the end of the five years' period.\n\n'The only source of income to the league, and the only funds to which its members can look for payment of the promised amount, or any amount whatever, is the fund created each month by the payment of monthly dues; and the realization of any amount whatever by the new members is conditioned absolutely upon the constant acquisition of other new members and the new payments to be made by such new members. And what amount the members or co-operators will realize, as is stated by the league literature, depends entirely upon the ratio of growth of the league. No reserve fund is accumulated and no investments whatever are made of any portion of the money paid in by members.'\n\n Upon this state of facts the master came to the conclusion that the scheme of the complainant was, in effect, a lottery, \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n and as such was not entitled to the use of the mails, and also reported to the court that the fraud order which had been issued by the Postmaster General in October, 1902, was fully justified, and that the injunction should be denied. His action was affirmed by the Circuit Court, and the bill dismissed for the want of equity.\nMr. D. I. Sicklesteel for appellant. \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy and\n Mr. W. A. Day for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n By  3929 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2686), as amended by the \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n act of September 19, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 465, chap. 908, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2686), 'The Postmaster General may, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any person or company is engaged in conducting any lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme for the distribution of money, or of any real or personal property by lot, chance, or drawing of any kind, or that any person or company is conducting any other scheme or device for obtaining money or property of any kind through the mails by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, instruct postmasters at any postoffice at which registered letters arrive directed to any such person or company . . . to return all such registered letters to the postmaster at the office at which they were originally mailed, with the word 'fraudulent' plainly written or stamped upon the outside thereof.'\n By  4041 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2749), the Postmaster General is authorized in similar terms to forbid the payment by any postmaster of any postal money order drawn in favor of any person engaged in the prohibited business; and by  4 of the act of March 2, 1895 (28 Stat. at L. 964, chap. 191, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2688); the power thus conferred upon the Postmaster General by the preceding section, 3929 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2686), is extended and made applicable to all letters or other matter sent by mail.\n These acts apply to two classes of cases: First, to schemes for the distribution of money, etc., by lot, chance, or drawing of any kind; second, to all schemes or devices for obtaining money or property of any kind by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\n It seems that the Postmaster General, in issuing the fraud order in this case, acted upon the theory that the complainant was engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money through the mails by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, etc., and not in conducting a lottery; but if the order detaining the letters was properly issued, in view of all the evidence introduced in the court below, we do not think it was vitiated by the fact that the Postmaster General acted upon the hypothesis that the business in which complainant was engaged \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n was a fraudulent scheme instead of a lottery, since both are within the purview of these statutes.\n We find no difficulty in sustaining the constitutionality of these sections. The postal service is by no means an indispensable adjunct to a civil government, and for hundreds, if not for thousands, of years the transmission of private letters was either intrusted to the hands of friends or to private enterprise. Indeed, it is only within the last three hundred years that governments have undertaken the work of transmitting intelligence as a branch of their general administration. While it has been known in this country since colonial times, and was recognized in the Constitution and in some of the earliest acts of Congress, the rates of postage were so high, and the methods of transmission so slow and uncertain, that it was not until 1845, when the postage was reduced to 5 and 10 cents, according to the distance, and a stamp or stamps introduced, that it assumed anything of the importance it now possesses.\n It is not, however, a necessary part of the civil government in the same sense in which the protection of life, liberty, and property, the defense of the government against insurrection and foreign invasion, and the administration of public justice are; but is a public function, assumed and established by Congress for the general welfare, and in most countries its expenses are paid solely by the persons making use of its facilities; and it returns, or is presumed to return, a revenue to the government, and really operates as a popular and efficient method of taxation. Indeed, this seems to have been originally the purpose of Congress. The legislative body, in thus establishing a postal service, may annex such conditions to it as it chooses.\n The constitutional principles underlying the administration of the Postoffice Department were discussed in the opinion of the court in Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 24 L. ed. 877, in which we held that the power vested in Congress to establish postoffices and post roads embraced the regulation of the entire postal system \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n of the country; that Congress might designate what might be carried in the mails and what excluded; and that in the enforcement of such regulations a distinction was made between letters and sealed packages subject to letter postage, and such other packages as were open to inspection, such as newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and other printed matter, and that the constitutional guaranty against unreasonable searches and seizures extended to letters, but did not extend to printed matter. In establishing such system Congress may restrict its use to letters, and deny it to periodicals; it may include periodicals, and exclude books; it may admit books to the mails, and refuse to admit merchandise; or it may include all of these and fail to embrace within its regulations telegrams or large parcels of merchandise, although in most civilized countries of Europe these are also made a part of the postal service. It may also refuse to include in its mails such printed matter or merchandise as may seem objectionable to it upon the ground of public policy, as dangerous to its employees or injurious to other mail matter carried in the same packages. The postal regulations of this country, issued in pursuance of act of Congress, contain a long list of prohibited articles dangerous in their nature, or to other articles with which they may come in conact; such, for instance, as liquids, poisons, explosives, and inflammable articles, fatty substances, or live or dead animals, and substances which exhale a bad odor. It has never been supposed that the exclusion of these articles denied to their owners any of their constitutional rights. While it may be assumed, for the purpose of this case, that Congress would have no right to extend to one the benefits of its postal service, and deny it to another person in the same class, and standing in the same relation to the government, it does not follow that under its power to classify mailable matter, applying different rates of postage to different articles, and prohibiting some altogether, it may not also classify the recipients of such matter, and forbid the delivery of letters to such persons or corporations as, in its judgment, are making \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n use of the mails for the purpose of fraud or deception or the dissemination among its citizens of information of a character calculated to debauch the public morality. For more than thirty years not only has the transmission of obscene matter been prohibited, but it has been made a crime, punishable by fine or imprisonment, for a person to deposit such matter in the mails. The constitutionality of this law we believe has never been attacked. The same provision was, by the same act, extended to letters and circulars connected with lotteries and gift enterprises, the constitutionality of which was upheld by this court in Re Rapier, \n143 U.S. 110\n, 36 L. ed. 93, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 374.\n It is contended, however, that the laws in question are unconstitutional in that they authorize the Postmaster General to seize and return to sender all letters addressed to a particular person, firm, or corporation which he is satisfied is making use of the mail for an illegal purpose. Their constitutionality is attacked upon three grounds: First, because they provide no judicial hearing upon the question of illegality; second, because they authorize the seizure of all letters, without discriminating between those which may contain, and those which may not contain, prohibited matter; and, third, because they empower the Postmaster General to confiscate the money, or the representative of money, of the addressee, which has become his property by the depositing of the letter in the mails.\n\n 1. \nIt is too late to argue that due process of law is denied whenever the disposition of property is affected by the order of an executive department. Many, if not most, of the matters presented to these departments require for their proper solution the judgment or discretion of the head of the department, and in many cases, notably those connected with the disposition of the public lands, the action of the department is accepted as final by the courts, and even when involving questions of law this action is attended by a strong presumption of its correctness. Bates & G. Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, ante, p. 595, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595. That due process of law does not necessarily require the interference of the judicial power is laid down in many cases and \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 509]\n\u00a0\n by many eminent writers upon the subject of constitutional limitations. Doe ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 18 How. 272, 280, 15 L. ed. 372, 376; Bushnell v. Leland, \n164 U.S. 684\n, 41 L. ed. 598, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209. As was said by Judge Cooley, in Weimer v. Bunbury, 30 Mich. 201: 'There is nothing in these words [due process of law], however, that necessarily implies that due process of law must be judicial process. Much of the process by means of which the government is carried on and the order of society maintained is purely executive or administrative. Temporary deprivations of liberty or property must often taken place through the action of ministerial or executive officers or functionaries, or even of private parties, where it has never been supposed that the common law would not afford redress.' If the ordinary daily transactions of the departments, which involve an interference with private rights, were required to be submitted to the courts before action was finally taken, the result would entail practically a suspension of some of the most important functions of the government. Even in the recent case of the American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 47 L. ed. 90, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33, the constitutionality of the law authorizing seizures of this kind by the Postmaster General was assumed, if not actually decided, the only reservation being that the person injured may apply to the courts for redress in case the Postmaster General has exceeded his authority, or his action is palpably wrong. So, too, in the recent case of Bates & G. Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, ante, p. 595, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595, the law was also assumed to be constitutional, the only doubtful question being whether this court should accept the findings of the Postmaster General as to the classification of the mail matter as final under the circumstances of the case. Inasmuch as the action of the Postmaster in seizing letters and returning them to the writers is subject to revision by the judicial department of the government in cases where the postmaster has exceeded his authority under the statute (American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 47 L. ed. 90, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33), we think it within the power of Congress to intrust him with the power of seizing and detaining \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 510]\n\u00a0\n letters upon evidence satisfactory to himself, and that his action will not be reviewed by the court in doubtful cases.\n\n 2. \nNor do we think the law unconstitutional because the Postmaster General may seize and detain all letters, which may include letters of a purely personal or domestic character, and having no connection whatever with the prohibited enterprise. In view of the fact that by these sections the postmaster is denied permission to open any letters not addressed to himself, there would seem to be no possible method of enforcing the law except by authorizing him to seize and detain all such letters. It is true it may occasionally happen that he would detain a letter having no relation to the prohibited business; but where a person is engaged in an enterprise of this kind, receiving dozens and perhaps hundreds of letters every day, containing remittances or correspondence connected with the prohibited business, it is not too much to assume that, prima facie at least, all such letters are identified with such business. A ruling that only such letters as were obviously connected with the enterprise could be detained would amount to practically an annulment of the law, as it would be quite impossible, without opening and inspecting such letters, which is forbidden, to obtain evidence of the real facts. Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 685\n, 32 S. L. ed. 253, 256, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 992, 1257; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 U.S. 133\n, 38 L. ed. 385, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499. Whether, in case a private registered letter was thus seized and detained, and damage was thereby occasioned to the addressee, an action would lie against the Postmaster Gereral, is not involved in this case. It certainly is not made the basis of the present suit.\n Another answer to this argument, which seems to be conclusive, is that the fraud order in this case is not open to this objection, as the Postmaster General only forbids the postmaster at Chicago to pay any postal money orders, drawn to the order of the League of Equity and the Public Clearing House, or their officers or agents in their capacity as such, and to inform the remitter of any such postal money order that payment thereof has been forbidden, etc., and 'to return all \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 511]\n\u00a0\n letters, whether registered or not, or other mail matter which shall arrive at your office directed to such concerns or their officers or agents as such, to postmasters at the office at which they were originally mailed.' There is nothing in the order thus worded that would authorize the postmaster at Chicago to return letters addressed to an individual unless addressed to such individual as officer or agent of the League of Equity or the complainants. There is nothing in this order that would authorize the interference with the private or domestic mail matter of individuals.\n\n 3. \nThe objection that the Postmaster General is authorized by statute to confiscate the money, or the representative of money, of the addressee, is based upon the hypothesis that the money or other article of value contained in a registered letter becomes the property of the addressee as soon as the letter is deposited in the postoffice. The action of the Postmaster General in seizing the letter does not operate as a confiscation of the money, or the determination of the title thereto; but merely as a refusal to extend the facilities of the Postoffice Department to the final delivery of the letter. Congress might undoubtedly have authorized the postmaster at the depositing office to decline to receive the letter at all if its forbidden character were known to him; but as this would be impossible, we think the power to refuse the facilities of the department to the transmission of such letter attends it at every step, from its first deposit in the mail to its final delivery to the addressee; and as the character of the letter cannot be ascertained until it arrives at the office of delivery, the government may then act and refuse to consummate the transaction. If the letter and its contents become the property of the addressee when deposited in the mail, the subsequent seizure by the government would not impair his title or prevent an action by him for the amount of remittance. True, this might be of no practical value to him, but it is a sufficient reply to show that the title to the letter did not change by its seizure by the postmaster. \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 512]\n\u00a0\n 4. The main question involved in this case, however, is whether the scheme of the complainant was within the language of  3929 and 4041 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2686 and 2749). The Postmaster General, in his fraud order, a copy of which is found in the bill, assumed that the League of Equity and the Public Clearing House were engaged in conducting a scheme for obtaining money by means of false and fraudulent representations or promises; but as the master found in his report that the Clearing House and its officers had dealt fairly and honestly in respect to the collection and distribution of funds collected by them, and had not been guilty of false or fraudulent representations in order to induce persons to become members of the league, this theory was abandoned by the government, and the case put upon the ground that these corporations were engaged in conducting a 'lottery or scheme for the distribution of money . . . by lot, chance, or drawing.' That they were not engaged in conducting a lottery in the sense in which that word is ordinarily used is entirely clear, since this involves fixed prizes and the allotment of the prizes to the holder of numbered tickets, which are drawn from a box. In such case the word 'lot' or 'chance' attaches only to the name or number of the ticket drawn, and not to the amount of the prize, but the statute covers any scheme for the distribution of money by lot or chance, as well as by drawing, and by the word chance, as defined by Webster, is meant 'something that befalls, as the result of unknown or unconsidered forces; the issue of uncertain conditions; an event not calculated upon; an unexpected occurrence; a happening; accident, fortuity, casualty.' As stated by the master, the plan contemplates that each person who becomes a member or co-operator pays $3 as enrolment fee, and agrees to pay the sum of $1 per month for sixty months or five years; and also agrees to co-operate by inducing other members or persons to become co- operators, shall receive his pro rata share of the total amount realized when entitled to a 'realization' as provided at the end of five years; or in case he shall have secured three new \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 513]\n\u00a0\n members in any one year, he may realize or receive at the end of each year one fifth of the amount which he would be entitled to receive at the end of five years, assuming that the growth of the five years continued at the same rate. The plan also contemplates that in the end the member who secures new members, and the one who does not, shall receive the same amount. All members joining the league during the same month constitute a class by themselves and are entitled to realize in all respects precisely the same amount, and at the same time, excepting the member who obtains new co-operators may receive his realization in yearly instalments instead of in one lump at the end of the five years' period.\n We do not consider it necessary to enter into the details of the plan, which is a somewhat complicated one, and the success of which obviously depended upon constantly and rapidly increasing the number of subscribers or co-operators. The only money paid in was a small enrolment fee of $3 and a monthly payment of $1 for five years. The return to the subscribing member, which is called a realization, is not only uncertain in its amount, but depends largely upon the number of new members each subscriber is able to secure, as well as the number of members which his co-operators are able to secure. The return to members who have been able to secure a large number of other members, and to pay their own monthly dues, may be very large in comparison with the amount paid in, but the amount of such return depends so largely, and, indeed, almost wholly, upon conditions which the member is unable to control, that we think it fulfils all the conditions of a distribution of money by chance. In becoming a co-operator each new member evidently contemplates that a large number, probably a large majority, of those subscribing will drop out before the end of five years; that some will and some will not induce others to become members, and that the amount ultimately realized depends not only upon his own prompt payment of dues, and his own exertions, but upon a corresponding action by other \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 514]\n\u00a0\n co-operators. One thing, however, is entirely clear, and that is, the success of the scheme depends wholly upon the ability of the members to increase the number of subscribers; and, as there is no reserve fund provided for their indemnification, there is sure to be a loss to every one interested in the enterprise as soon as the number of new members ceases to increase.\n Counsel for complainant liken the scheme to that of an ordinary life insurance company, which at an early date was thought by some to involve the elements of chance, but was finally held to be a legitimate business. In such policies there is the payment of a fixed sum, which matures either at the death of the assured or upon the happening of some other contingency expressly provided for in the policy. There is no uncertainty as to the amount to be paid, as in this case, nor does it depend upon the conduct of other persons insured in the same company, but simply upon payment of premiums by insured. The only contingency is the time as to when the policy is to mature, and the profits are calculated upon the theory that the premiums paid, with the interest thereon, will in the end amount to more than the sum becoming due upon the happening of the contingency. There is also a reserve fund provided for the security of policy holders in case no new applications are made for insurance, or the business of the company is abandoned. As the only fund provided in this scheme are small monthly payments which are constantly being divided in the shape of monthly realizations, there is no possibility of a reserve fund for the security of the co-operators. The uncertainty of the amount realized upon these settlements is evident from the fact that while a member may possibly realize as high as $15 for every dollar invested by him, he may realize no profit at all; or, in case the business is suspended, may realize nothing.\n In the careful and satisfactory report of the master the plan of the complainant is briefly described 'as a plan for securing money from a constantly increasing large number for the benefit of a constantly increasing smaller number, with an \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n absolute certainty that when the enterprise reaches an end for any reason the large number will lose every dollar they have put into it, and in the meantime the smaller number will have realized such amounts as may have resulted from the growth of the larger number; but no one can predict what that growth will be.'\n It is true, as urged by the counsel for complainant, that in investing money in any enterprise the investor takes the chance of small profits, or even of failure, as well as the hope of large profits; but such enterprises contemplate the personal exertions of the investor, or of his partners, agents, or employees, while in the present case his profits depend principally upon the exertions of others, over whom he has no control, and with whom he has no connection. It is in this sense the amount realized is determinable by chance.\n The scheme lacks the elements of a legitimate business enterprise, and we think there was no error in holding it to be a lottery within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, we think that no scheme of investment which must ultimately and inevitably result in failure can be called a legitimate business enterprise. The cases upon the subject of the definition of a lottery are carefully collated and criticized by Mr. Justice Blatchford in Horner v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 449, 458\n, 37 S. L. ed. 237, 241, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 409, and are held to extend to all schemes for the distribution of prizes by chance, such as policy playing, gift exhibitions, prize concerts, raffles at fairs, etc., and various forms of gambling.\n That the party injured has a right to invoke the judicial power of the government whenever his property rights have been invaded by the exercise of such power was settled by this court in Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co. \n147 U.S. 165\n, 37 L. ed. 123, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 271, as well as in the McAnnulty Case. But, as already indicated, it would practically arrest the executive arm of the government if the heads of departments were required to obtain the sanction of the courts upon the multifarious questions arising in their departments, before action were taken, in any matter which might involve the temporary disposition of private \n\n[194 U.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n property. Each executive department has certain public functions and duties, the performance of which is absolutely necessary to the existence of the government, but it may temporarily, at least, operate with seeming harshness upon individuals. But it is wisely indicated that the rights of the public must, in these particulars, override the rights of individuals, provided there be reserved to them an ultimate recourse to the judiciary.\n In the view we have taken of this case, and of the action of the court below, as well as of the course of the argument here, we have not found it necessary to inquire whether the action of the Postmaster General in basing his fraud order upon the theory that the defendants were engaged in a scheme for obtaining money or property by means of false representations was sustainable or not. As already stated, the master found that there had been no false representations of existing facts and no unfair dealing with the co-operators; yet, as we held in Durland v. United States, \n161 U.S. 306\n, 40 L. ed. 709, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 508, the misrepresentation of existing facts is not necessary to a conviction under a statute applying to 'any scheme or artifice to defraud.' As was observed by Mr. Justice Brewer (p. 313, L. ed. p. 711, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 511): 'Some schemes may be promoted through mere representations and promises as to the future, yet are none the less schemes and artifices to defraud. . . . In the light of this the statute must be read, and so read it includes everything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present, or suggestions and promises as to the future. The significant fact is the intent and purpose.' But, notwithstanding this question, we are satisfied the Postmaster General did not exceed his authority in making the order in this case, and the judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Holmes concurred in the result.\n Mr. Justice Peckham dissented. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAPHAEL v. TRASK(1904)\nNo. 229\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This suit was begun by filing a bill in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, seeking an injunction restraining the defendants, Spencer Trask & Company, from selling certain shares of capital stock of the Rio Grande & Western Railway Company to the Denver & Rio Grande Railway Company, unless a sufficient sum of money was deposited to indemnify the complainant upon the demand hereinafter set forth.\n It appears from the allegations of the bill that Nathaniel W. Raphael, since deceased, now represented by Martha Raphael as administratrix, on January 7, 1901, filed a bill in the United States circuit court for the district of Utah against the Wasatch & Jordan Valley Railroad Company and the Rio Grande & Western Railway Company and the Union Trust Company of New York, the object being to foreclose a mortgage given by the Wasatch & Jordan Valley Railroad Company, and to redeem from two independent mortgages certain branch railroads in the possession of, and claimed to be owned by, the Rio Grande & Western Railway Company. \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n While that suit was pending the present action was begun. The bill averred that the defendants, composing the firm of Spencer Trask & Company, had undertaken to obtain stock of the Rio Grande & Western Railway Company, and to sell the same to the representatives of the Denver & Rio Grande Railway Company, which company was proceeding to acquire the railroad of the Rio Grande & Western Railway Company by acquiring the common and preferred stock of that company.\n It is averred that Spencer Trask & Company, while negotiating the sale of said stock, learning of the foreclosure proceedings commenced by Raphael in the Utah court, made the following public advertisement:\n'Since the commencement of the negotiations one Raphael has instituted in the United States circuit court of Utah a suit against the title of the Western Company to the Bingham and Alta spurs of its railroad; and in making the contract for the vendors our firm gave its personal guarantee against any liability of the company in that suit. Although the company's solicitors are confident of success, it is proper that our guarantee be ratably shared by all who avail themselves of the contract made by us for the vendors. From the $80 per share and interest mentioned above, we shall, therefore, deduct such amount per share as counsel shall advise us will amply protect us upon such guarantee. Such amount will be held in a special trust.'\n\n The bill further avers:\n'That the members of said firm of Spencer Trask & Company are not parties to the suit pending in Utah, and that there is no agreement existing between complainant and the other holders of the outstanding bonds similar to complainant's bonds, and Spencer Trask & Company, by which the said proposed 'fund' shall be applied toward the satisfaction of complainant's bonds and the other outstanding bonds.'\n\n There are further allegations that the complainant--\n'Is informed and believes that if said consolidation, as set forth in the scheme contemplated by the advertisements re- \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n ferred to, is allowed to be carried out, without some stipulation between your orator and the members of the said firm of Spencer Trask & Company, as to the custody of the said fund, proposed to be created as aforesaid, the rights of remote purchasers of the mortgage premises, upon which complainant claims a lien, will have intervened pending complainant's suit in Utah, so that, if complainant succeeds at the final hearing of his suit in Utah, it will require the bringing into the suit, as defendants, such remote purchasers as the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railway Company and their proposed successors.'\n\n The prayer for relief is:\n'That a preliminary injunction be issued restraining the said members of the firm of Spencer Trask & Company from selling the said shares of the capital stock of the Rio Grande Western Railway Company to the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railway Company, as set forth in the said advertisements of Spencer Trask & Company, and which injunction your orator prays may be made perpetual upon the final hearing of this suit, unless the firm of Spencer Trask & Company shall agree to turn over to some trust company in the city of New York, at and before the completing of said sale of said shares, a sum of money which may be determined by this court, out of the proceeds of said sale, as will be sufficient to satisfy complainant's claim and the other outstanding bondholders, similar to his own, upon the final hearing of complainant's suit in Utah.'\n\n The bill also refers to the affidavit of one of the defendants, George Foster Peabody, filed in the Utah suit. This affidavit is annexed to the bill of complaint, and is in part as follows:\n'One stipulation of the agreement for the sale of common stock of the Rio Grande Western Railway Company, made by my banking firm of Spencer Trask & Company, is that my said firm shall guarantee the purchaser against any claim of the complainant in this suit. The statement in that respect contained in the circular letter of my firm to the holders of the \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n common stock of that company, of which one of such cuttings is a copy, is as follows:\n\n'Since the commencement of the negotiation one Raphael has instituted in the United States circuit court for Utah a suit against the title of the Western Company to the Bingham and Alta spurs of its railroad; and in making the contract for the vendors our firm gave its personal guarantee against any liability of the company in that suit. Although the company's solicitors are confident of success, it is proper that our guaranty be ratably shared by all who avail themselves of the contract made by us for the vendors. From the $80 per share and interest mentioned above we shall, therefore, deduct such amount per share as counsel shall advise us will amply protect us upon such guarantee. Such amount will be held in a special trust.'\n\n'The result of this provision is that if the complainant have any just claim, its payment is secured not only by the great excess of the assets of the Rio Grande Western Company itself over its debts, but also by a special amount to be held in trust. I am advised by the counsel of the Western Company that such provision is a fact against, and not in favor of, the complainant's motion, as it gives a greater assurance that, if the complainant's claim shall be established, it will be paid.\n\n'The statement of the said Raphael in his affidavit, that the retention of a fund to indemnify my said firm for their proposed guaranty against complainant's claim, is an attempt on the part of the Western Company to hinder and delay the complainant, is unqualifiedly false. The Western Company is in no way a party to the agreement or provision for such indemnity or such guaranty. The Western Company, if the purchase of its common stock shall be completed, will be itself indemnified against any claim of complainant.'\n\n To the bill of complaint the defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, appearing for that purpose and no other, setting forth that the plaintiff, at the time of the commencement of the suit, was, and continues to be, a citizen of the state of New Jersey; that two of the defendants, Charles J. \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n Peabody and Edwin M. Bulkley, were, at the time of the filing of the bill and the beginning of the suit, citizens of the state of New Jersey, and were not and had not been for over eight years either citizens or residents of the state of New York.\n The cause being brought on for hearing upon the plea, the bill of complaint was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Subsequently an application was made for leave to amend the bill and file a supplementary bill, which application was denied.\n Upon dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, the trial court certified the question of jurisdiction, and the cause came here by direct appeal.\n Mr. Charles Locke Easton for appellant.\n Messrs. Edward M. Shepard and William Mason Smith for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The circuit court sustained the plea of the defendants upon two grounds: 1, that the suit could not be maintained for want of the required diversity of citizenship; and, 2, that it could not be maintained as an ancillary or dependent proceeding for want of proper averments to bring the case within that branch of equity jurisdiction.\n As the offer to amend and file a supplemental bill was not entertained in the court below, and as the exercise of this discretion is not reviewable here, except in special cases, we are only concerned with the correctness of the conclusion of the circuit court in dismissing the original bill.\n As the case was brought on for consideration on bill of complaint and plea, the allegations of the plea are taken as admitted as upon demurrer thereto. Farley v. Kittson, \n120 U.S. 303\n-314, 30 L. ed. 684, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 534.\n Looked at as an original bill, it is elementary that all the \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n parties on one side of the controversy must be of diverse citizenship to those on the other. It is argued that the relief is sought not against the firm or its members personally, but to restrain the disposition of the fund pending the controversy, or to require it to be paid into the hands of a holder for the benefit of the complainant as his rights may be established, and as some of the defendants are residents of New York, the bill can be maintained.\n But we cannot concede the soundness of this claim. The action is against the firm, and every member of the firm is interested in the result. The proceeding is against them jointly. As between the complainant and the members of the firm who are residents of the state of New York, there is no separable controversy. The partners are jointly and equally interested in the fund alleged to be held and in the disposition of the suit commenced by the complainant. This proposition is so plain as to scarcely require the citation of authorities. In Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 U.S. 430\n, 29 L. ed. 962, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 799, the state of South Carolina commenced an action to recover certain money from partners. Stone, one of the partners, sought to remove the case on the ground that he was a citizen of the state of New York. The application was denied, and upon this subject Mr. Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the court, said:\n'The cause of action is joint, and only one of the defendants petitions for removal. . . . Neither is there any separable controversy in the case, such as might, if the necessary citizenship existed, allow Stone alone to remove the suit without joining Corbin with him in the petition for removal. The money sued for was received by the defendants as partners, and they are liable jointly for its payment, if they are liable at all.'\n\n We have no doubt that the case cannot be sustained as an original suit dependent upon diverse citizenship.\n Can the bill be sustained as an ancillary or supplementary bill?\n We had occasion to consider the nature of ancillary bills in \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n the late case of Julian v. Central Trust Co. decided at this term, \n193 U.S. 93\n, ante, 399, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399, and we are unable to find any precedent in the reported cases or text books which will maintain this bill in that aspect. Ancillary bills are ordinarily maintained in the same court as the original bill is filed, with a view to protecting the rights adjudicated by the court in reference to the subject-matter of the litigation, and in aid of the jurisdiction of the court, with a purpose of carrying out its decree and rendering effectual rights to be secured or already adjudicated. Story Eq. P1. 8th ed.  326; Root v. Woolworth, \n150 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1123, 1125, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136; 1 Bates Fed. Eq. Proc.  97.\n In the present case, the original action was begun to foreclose a mortgage upon property in Utah. It had nothing to do with the sale of the stock by the stockholders represented by Spencer Trask & Company. The stockholders were not parties to the Utah bill, nor could any relief be had against them in that suit. The purpose of Spencer Trask & Company in calling upon the vendors of the stock to deposit a certain amount, while having reference to the suit begun in Utah, did not evidence any agreement upon their part to indemnify the complainant because of any obligation or desire to protect him, but was a matter between that firm and the stockholders for whom it was acting. The purpose was to protect the selling firm, because of its guaranty to the purchasers of the stock, in case of any diminution in the value of the property in the event that the complainant prevailed in the suit in the Utah court. There was no privity of contract or trust relation between the complainant and defendants to this suit.\n It is true that the affidavit of George Foster Peabody, upon which much reliance is had, gives some support to the claim that the advertisement embodied an agreement for the indemnification of the complainant. At most this is but the construction that Mr. Peabody placed upon the advertisement, and could not enlarge the rights of the complainant, nor in any way change the true nature of the proceeding. Nor does it appear that this fund, had the complainant stood in such rela- \n\n[194 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n tion of privity of contract that he could claim the benefit of it, was necessary to the protection of the complainant's right in the property held by the railroad company, against which he was proceeding in Utah. There is nothing to show that the railroad company, with the large surplus which it was alleged to have accumulated, could not have responded to any decree which the complainant might have recovered in the foreclosure suit.\n Nor can the bill be maintained as one to stay waste. There is no estate of complainants in the hands of Spencer Trask & Company which is likely to be wasted pending the suit. As the complainant shows no legal or equitable right to the fund furnished by the stockholders, neither the method of its management nor its protection from diminution can concern him.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court was right, and that the bill cannot be maintained either as an original or ancillary proceeding.\n Judgment affirmed \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAWSON v.

U S(1904)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n This action was brought against the United States by J. Ribas Y Hijo, a Spanish corporation, to recover the sum of $10,000 as the value of the use of a certain merchant vessel taken by the United States in the Port of Ponce, Porto Rico, when that city was captured by the United States Army and Navy on July 28th, 1898\n\n\n The vessel was kept and used by the quartermaster's department of the Army until some time in April, 1899, when the War Department ordered its return to the owner, if all claim for use or damage for detention should be waived. Such conditional return was refused by the captain, who claimed to be a part owner, and with his crew he left the vessel.\n Subsequently the consignees of the vessel were notified that it was at their disposal; that the government was about to discharge those having it in care; and they were requested to put some one in control of it. This they declined to do, and the vessel was abandoned, and in August, 1899, was wrecked in a hurricane.\n The vessel was never in naval custody nor condemned as \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n prize. When seized it was a Spanish vessel, carried the Spanish flag, and its owner, captain, and crew were all Spanish subjects. It did not come within any of the declared exemptions from seizure set forth in the Proclamation of the President dent of April 26th, 1898. 30 Stat. at L. 1770. A claim filed in the War Department in February, 1900, for its use was rejected.\n Such being the facts found, the court below, upon final hearing, dismissed the action, upon the general ground that the vessel was properly seized as enemy's property, and its use was by the war power for war purposes.\n A rehearing was asked and was denied, the court saying: 'A rehearing is asked upon the ground that the court has found, as a matter of fact, that the use continued until in April, 1899, and, as the protocol, followed by the President's proclamation, was dated August 12th, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 1780], the complainants should recover on a quantum meruit the value of the use of the vessel between those dates. This was a seizure in time of war, and not in time of peace. It was, as has been said, a special case, arising from the necessary operation of war, and the war power of the government concluded it was necessary to take and use the property. Even conceding that the seizure did not terminate all right of the Spanish owner in the property, or to any use of it, yet the protocol and proclamation did not end the war. The protocol worked a mere truce. The President had not the power to terminate the war by treaty without the advice or consent of the Senate of the United States. If a treaty be silent as to when it is to become effective, the weight of authority is that it does not become so until ratified, and this was not done until in April, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1754], and the war did not end by treaty until then, and all the use made by the government of the vessel was justified by the rules of law and international law, without compensation.'\n Mr. Charles M. Boerman for appellant.   \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt and Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n 1. \nBy the 35th section of the act of Congress of April 12th, 1900, chap. 191, temporarily providing revenues and civil government for Porto Rico, it was declared that 'writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of the supreme court of Porto Rico and the district court of the United States shall be allowed, and may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the same manner, and under the same regulations, and in the same c ases, as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States; and such writs of error and appeal shall be allowed in all cases where the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress is brought in question, and the right claimed thereunder is denied; . . .' As the value of the matter here in dispute exceeds the sum of $5,000, and as the final judgment in a like case in the supreme court of one of the territories of the United States could be re-examined here, we have jurisdiction of the present appeal from the dis- \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n trict court of the United States for Porto Rico. 23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572); 31 Stat. at L. 85 chap. 191,  34, 35; Royal Ins. Co. v. Martin, \n192 U.S. 149\n, ante, p. 247, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247.\n\n 2. \nThis action, we have seen, was brought to recover the value of the use of a vessel belonging to Spanish subjects, and taken by our Army and Navy during the war with Spain, and used by the quartermaster's department of the Army.\n By the above act of April 12th, 1900, the court below was given, 'in addition to the ordinary urisdiction of district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.' 31 Stat. at L. 84, chap. 191,  34. If, therefore, this action could have been brought in a circuit court of the United States, it was within the cognizance of the court below We must, then, look to the act of March 3d, 1887, commonly known as the Tucker act, and which provides for the bringing of suits against the government of the United States. 24 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 359 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752).\n By the 1st section of that act it is provided that the court of claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine 'all claims founded upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress, except for pensions, or upon any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable . . .' The 2d section provides that 'the district courts of the United States shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims as to all matters named in the preceding section, where the amount of the claim does not exceed one thousand dollars, and the circuit courts of the United States shall have such concurrent jurisdiction in all cases where the amount of such claim exceeds one thousand dollars, and does not exceed ten thousand dollars.' The 5th \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n section is in these words: 'That the plaintiff in any suit brought under the provisions of the 2d section of this act shall file a petition, duly verified, with the clerk of the respective court having jurisdiction of the case, and in the district where the plaintiff resides. Such petition shall set forth the full name and residence of the plaintiff, the nature of his claim, and a succinct statement of the facts upon which the claim is based, the money or any other thing claimed, or the damages sought to be recovered, and praying the court for a judgment or decree upon the facts and law.'\n The government insists that the requirement in that act, that the petition shall be filed 'in the district where the plaintiff resides,' precludes a suit against the United States by any person, natural or corporate, residing out of the country. We express no opinion upon that question, as there are other grounds upon which we may satisfactorily rest our decision.\n The present suit finds no sanction in the above act, even if the plaintiff were not a foreign corporation. Its claim is not founded on the Constitution of the United States, or on any act of Congress, or on any regulation of an executive department. Nor can it be said to be founded on contract, express or implied. There is no element of contract in the case; for nothing was done by the United States, nor anything said by any of its officers, from which could be implied an agreement or obligation to pay for the use of the plaintiff's vessel. According to the established principles of public law, the owners of the vessel, being Spanish subjects, were to be deemed enemies, although not directly connected with military operations. The vessel was, therefore, to be deemed enemy's property. It was seized as property of that kind, for purposes of war, and not for any purposes of gain. The case does not come within the principle announced in United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co. \n112 \nU.S. 645, 656\n, 28 S. L. ed. 846, 850, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306, 311, where this court said that 'the United States, having by its agents, proceeding under the authority of an act of Congress, taken the property of claimant for public use, are under an obligation, imposed \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 323]\n\u00a0\n by the Constitution, to make compensation. The law will imply a promise to make the required compensation where property to which the government asserts no title is taken pursuant to an act of Congress as private property, to be applied for public uses. Such an implication being consistent with the constitutional duty of the government, as well as with common justice, the claimant's cause of action is one that arises out of implied contract, within the meaning of the statute which confers jurisdiction upon the court of claims of actions founded 'upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the government of the United States.\" The seizure, which occurred while the war was flagrant, was an act of war, occurring within the limits of military operations. The action, in its essence, is for the recovery of damages; but as the case is one sounding in tort, no suit for damages can be maintained under the statute, against the United States. It is none the less a case sounding in tort because the claim is in form for the use of the vessel after actual hostilities were suspended by the protocol of August 12th, 1898. A state of war did not, in law, cease until the ratification in April, 1899, of the treaty of peace. 'A truce or suspension of arms,' says Kent, 'does not terminate the war, but it is one of the commercia belli which suspends its operations . . . At the expiration of the truce, hostilities may recommence without any fresh declaration of war.' 1 Kent, Com. 159, 161. If the original seizure made a case sounding in tort, as it undoubtedly did, the transaction was not converted into one of implied contract because of the retention and use of the vessel, pending negotiations for a treaty of peace. Besides, the treaty of peace between the two countries provided that 'the United States and Spain mutually relinquish all claims for indemnity, national and individual, of every kind, of either government, or of its citizens or subjects, against the other government, that may have arisen since the beginning of the late insurrection in Cuba, and prior to the exchange of ratifications of the present treaty, including all claims for indemnity for the cost of the war. The United \n\n[194 U.S. 315, 324]\n\u00a0\n States will adjudicate and settle the claims of its citizens against Spain, relinquished in this article.' This stipulation clearly embraces the claim of the plaintiff,-its claim against the United States for indemnity having arisen prior to the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace with Spain.\n We may add that even if the act of March, 1887, standing alone, could be construed as authorizing a suit of this kind, the plaintiff Whitney v. Robertson, \n124 U.S. 190\n, 194, of a conflict between an act of Congress and a treaty,-each being equally the supreme law of the land,-the one last in date must prevail in the courts. The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 621, 20 L. ed. 227, 229; Whitney v. Robertson, \n124 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 31 S. L. ed. 386, 388, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456; United States v. Lee Yen Tai, \n185 \nU.S. 213, 221\n, 46 S. L. ed. 878, 883, 22 Sup. Ct.

Baker for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 504, 507]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. K. Bell and T. S. Reese for defendant in error. \n\n[193 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted of selling intoxicating liquors contrary to vote of his precinct prohibiting such sale. This vote was in pursuance of a statute which the plaintiff in error alleges to be contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The question was raised at the outset by a motion to quash, which was overruled, subject to exception; the exception was overruled on appeal, and the case was brought here by writ of error.\n The Constitution of Texas, art. 16,  20, required the legislature to enact a law by which the majority of qualified voters of any county, justice's precinct, town, or city, from time to time might determine whether the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited. The legislature thereupon enacted what now are articles 3384-3399 of the Revised Statutes, and articles 402-407 of the Penal Code. These all are assailed, but the particular object of attack is art. 3395\n\n\n Article 3395 is as follows:\n Art. 3395. \n\n[193 U.S. 504, 3238]\n\u00a0\n The failure to carry prohibition in a county shall not prevent an election for the same being immediately thereafter held in a justice's precinct or subdivision of such county as designated by the commissioners' court, or of any town or city in such county; nor shall the failure to carry prohibition in a town or city prevent an election from being immediately thereafter held for the entire justice's precinct or county in which said town or city is situated; nor shall the holding of an election in a justice's precinct in any way prevent the holding \n\n[193 U.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n of an election immediately thereafter for the entire county in which the justice's precinct is situated; but when prohibition has been carried at an election ordered for the entire county, no election on the question of prohibition shall be thereafter ordered in any justice's precinct, town, or city of said county until after prohibition has been defeated at a subsequent election for the same purpose, ordered and held for the entire county, in accordance with the provisions of this title; nor in any case where prohibition has carried in any justice's precinct shall an election on the question of prohibition be ordered thereafter in any town or city of such precinct until after prohibition has been defeated at a subsequent election, ordered and held for such entire precinct.\n It will be seen that this section discriminates in favor of those who vote for prohibition; and the argument is that since the legislature was not authorized to pass a prohibitory law (Dawson v. State, 25 Tex. App. 670, 674, 675, 8 S. W. 820), but was required to leave the question to a local vote, it necessarily created a pure democracy to that extent, and therefore could not interfere with the equality of the voters in their right to propose or carry a law. Many questions would have to be answered before so speculative a piece of ratiocination could be followed. But we think it may be dealt with in short space, so far as is necessary to decide this case.\n We follow the state court, of course, as to the state Constitution, and assume that the law is not invalid under that. The question for us is whether, if the state Constitution undertakes to authorize such a law, it encounters the Constitution of the United States. It is a question of the power of the state as a whole. Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 U.S. 165\n, 171, ante, p. 53, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53. But the state has power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors altogether, if it sees fit (Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 U.S. 623\n, 31 L. ed. 205, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273), and that being so it has power to prohibit it conditionally. It does not infringe the Constitution by giving those in favor of the sale a chance which it might have denied. It is true that the greater does not always include the less. A man may give his \n\n[193 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n property away, yet he may not contract with a carrier to take the risk of the latter's negligently injuring it, or part with it on the valuable consideration of a wager. But, in general, the rule holds good. It does here. The state has absolute power over the subject. It does not abridge that power by adopting the form of reference to a local vote. It may favor prohibition to just such degree as it chooses, and to that end may let in a local vote upon the subject as much or as little as it may please. There is no such overmastering consideration of expediency attaching everywhere and always to the form of voting, still less is there any such principle to be drawn from the 14th Amendment, as requires the two sides of a vote on prohibition to be treated with equal favor by the state, the subject- matter of the vote being wholly within the state's control. The only chance for the plaintiff in error to prevail was under the state Constitution. He has no case under the Constitution of the United States.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROGERS v. STATE OF ALABAMA(1904)\nNo. 407\nArgued: Decided: January 18, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. Wilford H. Smith for plaintiff in error.[ Rogers v. State of Alabama \n192 U.S. 226\n (1904) ]\n\n\n[192 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Massey Wilson for defendant in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of Alabama, brought on the ground that the plaintiff in error, one Rogers, has been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Rogers was indicted for murder, and in due time filed a motion to quash the indictment because the jury commissioners appointed to select the grand jury excluded from the list of persons to serve as grand jurors all colored persons, although largely in the majority of the population of the county, and although otherwise qualified to serve as grand jurors, solely on the ground of their race and color and of their having been disfranchised and deprived of all rights as electors in the state of Alabama by the provisions of the new Constitution of Alabama. The motion alleged that the grand jury was composed exclusively of persons of the white race, and concluded with a verification. To show the reality of the second reason alleged for the exclusion of blacks from the grand jury list, the motion, as a preliminary, alleged that the sections of the new Constitution which were before this court in Giles v. Harris, \n189 U.S. 475\n, 47 L. ed. 909, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 639, were adopted for the purpose, and had the effect, of disfranchising all the blacks on account of their race and color and previous condition of servitude. On motion of the state this motion to quash was stricken from the files. Rogers excepted, but his exceptions were overruled by the supreme court of the state, seemingly on the ground that the prolixity of the motion was sufficient to justify the action of \n\n[192 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n the court below. The Civil Code of Alabama provides by  3286, 'if any pleading is unnecessarily prolix, irrelevant, or frivolous, it may be stricken out at the costs of the party so pleading, on motion of the adverse party.'\n We follow the construction impliedly adopted by the supreme court of Alabama, and assume that this section was applicable to the motion. We also assume, as said by the court, that the qualifications of the grand jurors are not in law dependent upon the qualifications of electors, and that any invalidity of the conditions attached to the suffrage could not of itself affect the validity of the indictment. But in our opinion that was not the allegation. The allegation was that the conditions said to be invalid worked as a reason and consideration in the minds of the commissioners for excluding blacks from the list. It may be that the allegation was superfluous and would have been hard to prove, but it was not irrelevant, for it stated motives for the exclusion which, however mistaken, if proved, tended to show that the blacks were excluded on account of their race, as part of a scheme to keep them from having any part in the administration of the government or of the law. The whole motion takes two pages of the printed record, of the ordinary octavo size. A motion of that length, made for the sole purpose of setting up a constitutional right, and distinctly claiming it, cannot be withdrawn for prolixity from the consideration of this court, under the color of local practice, because it contains a statement of matter which, perhaps, it would have been better to omit, but which is relevant to the principal fact averred.\n It is a necessary and well settled rule that the exercise of jurisdiction by this court to protect constitutional rights cannot be declined when it is plain that the fair result of a decision is to deny the rights. It is well known that this court will decide for itself whether a contract was made as well as whether the obligation of the contract has been impaired. Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436, 443, 17 L. ed. 173, 177. But that is merely an illustration of a more general rule. On the same ground \n\n[192 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n there can be no doubt that if full faith and credit were denied to a judgment rendered in another state upon a suggestion of want of jurisdiction, without evidence to warrant the finding, this court would enforce the constitutional requirement. See German Sav. & L. Soc. v. Dormitzer, Jan. 4, 1904, \n192 U.S. 125\n, ante, 221, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 221. In Chapman v. Goodnow, \n123 \nU.S. 540, 547\n, 548 S., 31 L. ed. 235, 238, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211, where the parties sought to avoid the obligation of a former decree by new matter, this court said that the effect of what was done was not a Federal question, but proceeded to inquire in terms whether that ground of decision was the real one, or whether it was set up as an evasion, and merely to give color to a refusal to allow the bar of the decree. We are of opinion that the Federal question is raised by the record, and is properly before us. That question is disposed of by Carter v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 442\n, 44 L. ed. 839, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687, and it was error not to apply that decision. The result of that and the earlier cases may be summed up in the following words of the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Gray: 'Whenever, by any action of a state, whether through its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded, solely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied to him, contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n, 25 L. ed. 664; Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 397\n, 26 S. L. ed. 567, 574; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 U.S. 565\n, 40 L. ed. 1075, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 904.' Our judgment upon this point makes it unnecessary to consider a motion to quash the panel of the petit jury for similar reasons, which was disposed of as having been made too late.\n Judgment reversed, and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROYAL INS CO v.

The case was tried by the court and a jury, and a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff for $7,623, the court refusing to require the jury to find the damages, separately, as to the building and the stock of goods; and for the above amount judgment was rendered against the company.\n This was an action by the executor of the of this court to review the judgment below. If this position be well taken, the writ of error should be dismissed without considering the merits of the case. Continental Nat. Bank v. Buford, \n191 U.S. 119\n, ante, 54, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54. We must therefore examine the question of the jurisdiction, which depends upon the scope and effect of various statutory provisions, including those relating to the court established by Congress in Porto Rico. We will look at the statutes according to the respective dates of their enactment. \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n By  702 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 571), it is provided that 'the final judgments and decrees of the supreme court of any territory except the territory of Washington, in cases where the value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs , . . . exceeds $1,000, may be reviewed and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court [of the United States] upon writ of error or appeal, in the same manner and under the same regulations as the final judgments and decrees of a circuit court. In the territory of Washington the value of the matter in dispute must exceed $2,000, exclusive of costs. And any final judgment or decree of the supreme court of said territory in any cause [when] the Constitution or a statute or treaty of the United States is brought in question may be reviewed in like manner.'\n This provision was modified by the act of March 3d, 1885, entitled 'An Act Regulating Appeals from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and the Supreme Courts of the Several Territories;' for by the latter act it was provided: ' 1. That no appeal or writ of error shall hereafter be allowed from any judgment or decree in any suit at law or in equity in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, or in the supreme court of any of the territories of the United States, unless the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of $5,000.  2. That the preceding section shall not apply to any case wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States; but in all such cases an appeal or writ of error may be brought without regard to the sum or value in dispute.' 23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572.\n Then came the act of March 3d, 1891, 'to establish circuit courts of appeals, and to define and regulate in certain cases the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, and for other purposes.' 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547. The 5th section of that act prescribes the cases that may be brought directly to this court from the district courts or from the existing circuit courts of \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n the United States, while the 6th section provides that the circuit courts of appeals 'shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or by writ of error final decision in the district court and the existing circuit courts in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law;' the judgments or decrees of the circuit court of appeals to be final 'in all cases in which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being aliens and citizens of the United States, or citizens of different states; also in all cases arising under the patent laws, under the revenue laws, and under the criminal laws, and in admiralty cases.' Further, by the same section: 'In all cases not hereinbefore, in this [6th] section, made final, there shall be of right an appeal or writ of error or review of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States where the matter in controversy shall exceed $1,000, besides costs.'  6. The 13th section of the act provides: 'Appeals and writs of error may be taken and prosecuted from the decisions of the United States court in the Indian territory to the Supreme Court of the United States, or to the circuit court of appeals in the eighth circuit, in the same manner and under the same regulations as from the circuit or district courts of the United States, under this act.' And the 15th section is in these words: 'That the circuit court of appeal in cases in which the judgments of the circuit courts of appeal are made final by this act shall have the same appellate jurisdiction, by writ of error or appeal, to review the judgments, orders, and decrees of the supreme courts of the several territories as by this act they may have to review the judgments, orders, and decrees of the district court and circuit courts; and for that purpose the several territories shall, by orders of the Supreme Court, to be made from time to time, be assigned to particular circuits.' 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547.\n This brings us to the act of April 12th, 1900, chap. 191, entitled, 'An Act Temporarily to Provide Revenues and a Civil Govern- \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n ment for Porto Rico, and for Other Purposes.' 31 Stat. at L. 85.\n By  33 of that act it is declared, among other things, that the judicial power shall be vested in the courts and tribunals of Porto Rico as then established and in operation, under and by virtue of certain general orders promulgated by military authority,-the chief justice and associate justices of the supreme court of Porto Rico, and the marshal thereof, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the judges of the district courts by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the executive council.\n By the 34th section of that act Porto Rico was constituted a judicial district, to be called the district of Porto Rico, with a district judge, a district attorney, and marshal, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and with a district court called the 'district court of the United States for Porto Rico,' which court, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, shall have jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States.\n The section of the Porto Rico act upon which the question of our jurisdiction mainly depends is the 35th, which is in these words: 'That writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of the supreme court of Porto Rico and the district court of the United States shall be allowed and may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the same manner and under the same regulations and in the same cases as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States; and such writs of error and appeal shall be allowed in all cases where the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress, is brought in question, and the right claimed thereunder is denied; and the supreme and district courts of Porto Rico, and the respective judges thereof, may grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases in which the same are grantable by the judges of the district and circuit courts of the \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 159]\n\u00a0\n United States. All such proceedings in the Supreme Court of the United States shall be conducted in the English language.' 31 Stat. at L. 85, chap. 191.\n It thus appears that writs of error and appeals may be prosecuted directly to this court from the district court of the United States for Porto Rico, in the same manner, under the same regulations, and 'in the same cases' as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States.\n Could a case like the one before us have been brought directly to this court from the supreme court of one of the territories of the United States? If so, our jurisdiction in this case cannot be disputed under the Porto Rico act.\n The question just stated must be answered in the affirmative, if we look alone at  702 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 571), and the act of March 3d, 1885, chap. 355 (23 Stat. at L. 443, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572); for it is clear from the express words of those enactments that this court may review the final judgment of the supreme court of one of the territories of the United States in any case, without regard to the sum or value in dispute, where the Constitution or a statute or treaty is brought in question, and in every other case whatever where the sum or value in dispute exceeds $5,000, exclusive of costs.\n Is this result, so far as the final judgments of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico are concerned, affected by anything in the circuit court of appeals act of 1891? We think not. That act, no doubt, contemplated a review by the appropriate circuit court of appeals, first, of the final judgments of the United States court in the Indian territory in all cases covered by  702 of the Revised Statutes and the act of March 3d, 1891; second, of the final judgments of the supreme courts of the other territories of the United States in cases the judgments in which, by that act ( 6), are made final. No provision is found in the act of 1891 for the review in a circuit court of appeals of the judgment of the supreme court of a territory of the United States in a case of the class the judgment in which, if rendered in a circuit court of appeals, is not final. So that the jurisdiction \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 160]\n\u00a0\n of this court to review the judgments of the supreme courts of the several territories in that class of cases was the same after as before the passage of that act. Shute v. Keyser, \n149 \nU.S. 649, 651\n, 37 S. L. ed. 884, 885, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 960. Clearly, this case is not of the class the judgment in which, if rendered in the supreme court of a territory of the United States, to use the words of the act of 1891, is reviewable in a circuit court of appeals under that act. It is not a patent, revenue, or criminal case, nor one in which the jurisdiction of the court below depended entirely upon the opposite parties to the controversy being aliens and citizens of the United States or citizens of different states. But it is one which, if it had been determined by the supreme court of one of such territories of the United States, could have been brought here directly, upon writ of error, after as well as before the passage of the act of 1891. Our conclusion must, therefore, be that the jurisdiction of this court cannot be denied by reason of any provision in the act of 1891\n\n\n This view is strengthened by what we deem the better construction of the Porto Rico act of 1900. That act does not refer to the circuit court of appeal act of 1891, nor contain any provision looking to the assignment of Porto Rico to one of the established circuits. This tends to show that it was the intention of the act of 1900 to establish a direct connection between this court and the United States court for Porto Rico in respect of every case which, if determined by the supreme court of a territory of the United States, could have been brought here under the statutes in force when the act of 1891 was passed. In our opinion, Congress did not intend that any connection should exist between the United States court for Porto Rico and any circuit court of appeals established under the act of 1891.\n These views as to the scope and effect of the Porto Rico act of 1900 are not at all affected by the provisions in the acts relating to the re- examination of the final judgments of the highest courts of the Indian territory, Hawaii, and Alaska. 'Indian Territory,' 26 Stat. at L. 829, chap, 517,  13, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 553; 'Hawaii,' 31 Stat. at L. 141, 158, \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 161]\n\u00a0\n chap. 339,  86; 'Alaska,' 31 Stat. at L. 321, 345, chap. 786. Those acts had exclusive reference to the particular territories named; each, upon its face, showing that the final judgments of the courts of those territories, at least in certain cases, should be reviewable, primarily, in a designated circuit court of appeals of the United States. No such provisions are found in the act of 1900, and this court has not assumed to assign Porto Rico to any circuit of the United States. The territories of the United States, referred to in the 15th section of the act of 1891, are, in our opinion, those which it was contemplated would be assigned to some circuit, and they do not embrace Porto Rico; and the words in the act of 1900, 'in the same manner and under the same regulations and in the same cases as from the supreme court of a territory of the United States,' refer not to the act of 1891, but to those general statutes authorizing this court to review the final judgment of the supreme court of a territory of the United States in every case, without regard to the sum or value in dispute, where the Constitution of the United States or a treaty thereof or an act of Congress is brought in question, and the right claimed thereunder is denied, and in every other case where the sum or value in dispute exceeds $5,000, exclusive of costs. If Congress had intended that the judgments of the United States court for Porto Rico should, in any class of cases, be re-examined in some circuit court of appeals of the United States, it would have so declared by appropriate words. It did not so declare.\n For the reasons stated, we hold that our jurisdiction to re-examine it cannot be questioned.\n We come now to the merits of the case; our attention being first directed to the questions arising under that clause of the policy providing that it shall not cover 'loss or damage by fire happening during the existence of any invasion, foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law within the country or locality in which the property insured is situated, unless proof be made to the satisfaction of the directors that such loss or damage \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 162]\n\u00a0\n was not occasioned by or connected with, but occurred from a cause or causes independent of, the existence of such invasion, foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law.'\n As the words of the policy are those of the company, they should be taken most strongly against it, and the interpretation should be adopted which is most favorable to the insured, if such interpretation be not inconsistent with the words used. First Nat. Bank v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n95 \nU.S. 673, 678\n, 679 S., 24 L. ed. 563, 565; Liverpool & L. & G. Ins. Co. v. Kearney, \n180 \nU.S. 132, 136\n, 45 S. L. ed. 460, 462, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 326; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Reiss, \n183 \nU.S. 621, 626\n, 46 S. L. ed. 358, 360, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 253. In this view the above words should be held to mean that the policy covered loss by fire occurring during the existence of (if not occasioned by nor connected with) any invasion, foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law, in the general locality where the property insured was situated. If the loss so occurred, then the company was entitled to demand, before being sued, that proofs be furnished showing that the loss was not occasioned by or connected with, but was from causes independent of, such invasion, foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law. But the company made no demand for proofs on this point. On the contrary, the formal production of such proofs was, in effect, waived; for the company assumed that what occurred in the locality at the time of the fire constituted a riot, which relieved it from all liability. It, therefore, gave notice by its agents that, as the fire and the destruction of the goods 'were produced by a riot, they were not compelled to pay,' and that 'the policy would not be paid.' A general, absolute refusal to pay in any event, or a denial by the company of all liability under its policy, dispensed with such formal proofs as a condition of its liability to be sued, and opened the way for a suit by the assured in order that the rights of the parties could be determined by the courts according to the facts as disclosed by evidence. It was so held by this court in a case of fire \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 163]\n\u00a0\n insurance (Tayloe v. Merchants' F. Ins. Co. 9 How. 390, 403, 13 L. ed. 187, 192); and the same principle was recognized as applicable in a case of life insurance. Knickerbocker L. Ins. Co. v. Pendleton, \n112 \nU.S. 696, 709\n, 28 S. L. ed. 866, 870, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 314. To the same effect are authorities cited by text-writers. 2 May, Ins. 3d ed.  469; 2 Biddle, Ins .  1139; 2 Wood, Fire Ins. 2d ed.  445. Now, whether there was any substantial connection between the fire and military or other disturbance of the kind specified existing in the locality where the property was situated was a question of fact, and it was properly left to the jury. The court, referring to the above clause of the policy, charged the jury: 'A fair construction of that condition, in the opinion of the court, is that, in order to excuse this company from liability in case of loss of property by fire, that invasion by foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law must have been occurring within the section of the country where this loss occurred, or within the locality and within such radius of country where the loss occurred that damage arose to property by reason of the existence of that rebellion, invasion, or usurped power, or martial law. And or usurped power, or martial law. And I further tell you, gentlemen, that if you believe from the evidence that this destruction of property did not occur from any of these causes, and occurred from a cause independent of the existence of any foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, military or usurped power, or martial law, then you should find, so far as this defense was concerned, for the plaintiff in damages whatever you think may have been his loss.'\n While there is some little confusion in this part of the record, we think that the trial court did not misconstrue the policy, nor commit any error upon this particular point of which the plaintiff was entitled to complain. It is to be taken that the jury found, upon the whole evidence, that the loss was occasioned by causes independent of the existence of any invasion, foreign enemy, rebellion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 164]\n\u00a0\n military or usurped power, or martial law. The facts under this issue having been fairly submitted to the jury, its finding cannot be disturbed.\n An important question remains to be considered. It arises out of the interest which the assured had in the property at the time of the fire. The evidence showed that the original policy was issued to Francisco Martin on the 12th day of March, 1877, he being at that time the sole owner of the building and of the goods contained in it. The policy was renewed from year to year, the last one being dated March 12th, 1898, and extending until March 12th, 1899. The fire occurred in August, 1898, the assured being then alive. He did not die until October, 1899. Now, at the time of the fire, the goods insured had, by act of the assured, become, in their entirety, the property of Martin Brothers, a firm or society composed of two sons of the assured as active partners, and of himself as silent partner. The father turned over the business to the control and management of the two sons, and to them surrendered the custody of the goods constituting the stock in trade. At what date the sons acquired their interests in the goods and in the business does not distinctly appear. But it was before the fire; and of the change whereby the father ceased to be the sole owner of the goods described in the renewal policy and whereby also they became the property of the firm of Martin Brothers, no notice whatever was given to the company prior to the fire.\n The question is whether such change in the ownership of the goods insured-no change occurring in the ownership of the building-discharged the company from all liability on the policy under that clause providing that the policy should cease 'to be in force as to any property hereby insured which shall pass from the insured to any other person otherwise than by due operation of law, unless notice thereof be given to the company, and the subsistence of the insurance in favor of such other person be declared by a memorandum indorsed hereon by or on behalf of the company.'\n Upon the question whether an insurance policy of the gen- \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 165]\n\u00a0\n eral class to which the one in suit belongs continues in force after a sale or transfer by the assured of his interest in the property insured, the adjudged cases are by no means in accord, and it will serve no useful purpose to make an extended review of them and show wherein they differ. It will be found upon examination that each policy contained language peculiar to itself, and upon that language the particular case turned. Of course, in every case, the fundamental inquiry must be as to the intention of the parties, to be gathered from the words of the policy; always, however, interpreting the policy most favorably for the insured, where it is reasonably susceptible of two constructions.\n On the face of the policy in suit it appears that the buildings and the goods contained in them were insured separately,-700 on the building and 900 on the stock in trade. One construction of the policy is that if either the building or the stock in trade should pass from the assured to another person, then the policy should cease as to all the property insured. But another construction, the one most favorable to the assured, which is not unreasonable, and which is not forbidden by the words used, is that, as the building and the stock in trade were separately insured, the policy should cease to be in force only as to the particular property insured that passed from the assured without notice to the company. The latter is the better construction, and we hold that it is to be considered as if the building was covered by one policy and the goods by another. Whatever may have been the extent of the interest acquired by the firm of Martin Bros. in the goods, no interest in the building passed to them. The building remained, in its entirety, the sole property of the assured, up to the time of the fire, and the policy may reasonably be, and therefore ought to be, so construed as not to preclude a recovery in respect of its destruction by fire.\n But in respect of the goods in question, the case depends upon other considerations. When the goods were insured they were, in their entirety, the sole property of Francisco \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 166]\n\u00a0\n Martin, the assured. He was the legal owner of the whole of them. They were in his custody, and subject to his exclusive control. But at the time of their destruction by fire the ownership of the goods, in their entirety, had, by transfer from the assured, passed to Martin Brothers, and became, without notice to the company, subject to the exclusive control, in their entirety, of that firm. Such a change of ownership and control, it must be held, avoided the policy, unless it was kept alive by the mere fact that the assured, although taking no active part in the business of the firm, was yet a silent partner, and as such had some interest in the insured property. But that fact cannot be given the weight suggested, without ignoring altogether the reasons which, it must be assumed, induced the company to incorporate into its policy the provision that if any property insured passed from the assured to another person without notice to the company, the policy should cease to be in force. It may well be that an insurance company would be willing to insure property owned by a particular person of whose character and habits its agent had knowledge or information, but unwilling to insure the same property if owned by that person in connection with others. Prudence requires that a company, before insuring against fire, should be informed as to the actual ownership of the property proposed to be insured, and know who, in virtue of such ownership, will be entitled to its custody and to control it during the term of the policy. The provision that the policy in this case should cease to be in force from the moment the insured property passed from the assured to others without notice to the company implied not only that the company relied upon the integrity and watchfulness of the assured, but that, if he looked to the company for indemnity against loss by fire, he must take care not to allow the property to 'pass' from him to others, without notice to the insurer. The assured without notice to the company, did pass the goods in question to a firm, each member of which thereby acquired an interest in the whole of the goods transferred. The ownership of the firm was, in law \n\n[192 U.S. 149, 167]\n\u00a0\n and in fact, distinct from the original sole ownership of the assured. Practically, for all purposes of guarding the goods insured against destruction by fire, they passed to the active partners, who were strangers to the property at the date of the policy,-the assured, as a silent partner, retaining no interest in any particular part of the goods, and being under no obligation as between himself and the active partners to care for the safety of the property. Its safety, after the transfer, depended altogether upon the watchfulness of the active partners, in whose possession the goods were up to the fire. It only remained for the original sole owner, after passing the goods in their entirety to the firm of Martin Brothers, in which he was a silent partner, to receive such profits as accrued to him from their use in the business as conducted by the active partners.\n We are of opinion that the case was not tried in accordance with a sound construction of the terms of the policy relating to the goods insured. The court proceeded upon the ground that there was no evidence of such alienation or change of ownership as avoided the policy in respect of the goods. In this error was committed, and a new trial must be had in conformity with the views we have herein expressed.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with directions to set aside the judgment, and grant a new trial.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHICK v. U S(1904)\nNo. 222\nArgued: December 2, 1903Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. William D. Guthrie and Francis J. Kearful for plaintiffs in error.\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 65, 66]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The constitutionality of the oleomargarine legislation hav- \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n ing been settled in McCray v. United States (just decided), 194 U. S. --, ante, 769, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, there is in these two cases only a single question. The plaintiffs in error were severally prosecuted by information in the district court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois, under  11 of the act of August 2, 1886 (24 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 840, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2228), which reads: 'That every person who knowingly purchases or receives for sale any oleomargarine which has not been branded or stamped according to law shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such offense.'\n In each case the parties in writing waived a jury, and agreed to submit the issues to the court. Judgments were entered in favor of the United States, and their collection ordered by only the civil process of execution. That the defendants had failed to comply with the section was proved. Indeed, it was not seriously disputed; the defense resting only on the alleged unconstitutionality of the act. The waiver of a jury was not assigned as error, nor referred to by counsel at the hearing before us, either in brief or argument. The question of its effect upon the judgment was suggested by this court, and briefs were called for from the respective parties. Such briefs have been filed, and both agree that the waiver of a jury did not invalidate the proceedings. Notwithstanding this, the fact of the waiver appears in the record.\n We entertain no doubt that the parties could rightfully make such a waiver and that the judgments are in no way invalidated thereby. It will be noticed that the section characterizes the act prohibited as an offense, and subjects the party to a penalty of $50. So small a penalty for violating a revenue statute indicates only a petty offense. It is not one necessarily involving any moral delinquency. The violation may have been the result of ignorance or thought-lessness and must be classed with such illegal acts as acting as an auctioneer or peddler without a license, or making a deed without affixing the proper stamp. That by other sections of this statute more serious offenses are described, and more grave punishments provided does not lift this one to the \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n dignity of a crime. Not infrequently a single statute in its several sections provides for offenses of different grades, subject to different punishments, and to prosecution in different ways. In some states, in the same act are gathered all the various offenses against the person, ranging from simple assault to murder, and imposing punishments, from a mere fine to death. This very statute furnishes an illustration. By one clause the knowingly selling of adulterated butter in any other than the prescribed form subjects the party convicted thereof to a fine of not more than $1, 000 and imprisonment for not more than two years. An officer of customs, violating certain provisions of the act, is declared guilty of a misdemeanor, and subject to a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $ 5,000, and imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than three years. Obviously, these violations of certain provisions of the statute must be classed among serious criminal offenses, and can be prosecuted only by indictment, while the violations of the statute in the cases before us were prosecuted by information. The truth is, the nature of the offense, and the amount of punishment prescribed, rather than its place in the statutes, determine whether it is to be classed among serious or petty offenses,-whether among crimes or misdemeanors. Clearly, both indicate that this particular violation of the statute is only a petty offense.\n In such a case there is no constitutional requirement of a jury. In the 3d clause of  2, article 3, of the Constitution, it is provided that 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury;' and in article 6 of the Amendments, that 'in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.' If there be any conflict between these two provisions, the one found in the Amendments must control, under the well-understood rule that the last expression of the will of the lawmaker prevails over an earlier \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n one. But that in the body of the Constitution does not include a petty offense like the present. It must be read in the light of the common law. 'That,' said Mr. Justice Bradley, in Moore v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 23 S. L. ed. 346, 347, referring to the common law, 'is the system from which our judicial ideas and legal definitions are derived. The language of the Constitution and of many acts of Congress could not be understood without reference to the common law.' Again, in Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 478\n, 31 S. L. ed. 508, 512, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 809, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564, 569, is this declaration by Mr. Justice Matthews: 'The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history.' In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649, 654\n, 42 S. L. ed. 890, 892, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, 459, Mr. Justice Gray used this language:\n'In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 22 L. ed. 627; Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 422\n, 29 S. L. ed. 89, 91, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; Boyd v.

See also Kepner v. United States, 194 U. S. --, ante, 797, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797; 1 Kent Com. 336.\n\n Blackstone's Commentaries are accepted as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England. At the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, it had been published about twenty years, and it has been said that more copies of the work had been sold in this country than in England; so that undoubtedly, the framers of the Constitution were familiar with it. In this treatise, vol. 4, p. 5. is given a definition of the word 'crimes:'\n'A crime, or misdemeanor, is an act committed, or omitted, in violation of a public law either forbidding or commanding it. This general definition comprehends both crimes and misdemeanors; which, properly speaking, are mere synonymous terms; though in common usage the word 'crimes' is made to denote such offenses as are of a deeper and more atrocious \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n dye; while smaller faults and omissions of less consequence are comprised under the gentler name of 'misdemeanors' only.'\n\n In the light of this definition we can appreciate the action of the convention which framed the Constitution. In the draft of that instrument, as reported by the committee of five, the language was 'the trial of all criminal offenses . . . shall be by jury,' but by unanimous vote it was amended so as to read 'the trial of all crimes.' The significance of this change cannot be misunderstood. If the language had remained 'criminal offenses,' it might have been contended that it meant all offenses of a criminal nature, petty as well as serious; but when the change was made from 'criminal offenses' to 'crimes,' and made in the light of the popular understanding of the meaning of the word 'crimes,' as stated by Blackstone, it is obvious that the intent was to exclude from the constitutional requirement of a jury the trial of petty criminal offenses. But we need not go beyond the express rulings of this court. In Callan v. Wilson, \n127 U.S. 540\n, 32 L. ed. 223, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301, reference was made to many decisions of state courts, holding that the trial of petty offenses was not within any constitutional provision requiring a jury in the trial of crimes, and on page 557, L. ed. p. 228, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 1307, it was said:\n'Except in that class or grade of offenses called petty offenses, which, according to the common law, may be proceeded against summarily in any tribunal legally constituted for that purpose, the guaranty of an impartial jury to the accused in a criminal prosecution, conducted either in the name, or by or under the authority, of the United States, secures to him the right to enjoy that mode of trial from the first moment, and in whatever court, he is put on trial for the offense charged.'\n\n By  563, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 455) the district courts are given jurisdiction 'of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States, committed within their respective districts, or upon the high seas, the punishment of which is not capital.' There is no act of Congress requiring that \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n the trial of all offenses shall be by jury, and a court is fully organized and competent for the transaction of business without the presence of a jury. There is no public policy which forbids the waiver of a jury in the trial of petty offenses. On the contrary, by  44 of the Code of Law for the District of Columbia, Congress provided, in respect to the police court, that--\n'In all prosecutions within the jurisdiction of said court, in which, according to the Constitution of the United States, the accused would be entitled to a jury trial, the trial shall be by jury, unless the accused shall, in open court, expressly waive such trial by jury, and request to be tried by the judge, in which case the trial shall be by such judge, and the judgment and sentence shall have the same force and effect in all respects as if the same had been entered and pronounced upon the verdict of a jury. In all cases where the accused would not, by force of the Constitution of the United States, be entitled to trial by jury, the trial shall be by the court without a jury, unless in such of said last-named cases wherein the fine or penalty may be $50 or more, or imprisonment as punishment for the offense may be thirty days or more, the accused shall demand a trial by jury, in which case the trial shall be by jury.'\n\n And it is a well-known fact that in many territories organized by act of Congress the legislature has authorized the prosecution of petty offenses in the police courts of cities, without a jury.\n But if there be no constitutional or statutory provision or public policy requiring a jury in the trial of petty offenses, upon what ground can it be contended that a defendant therein may not voluntarily waive a jury? Can it be that a defendant can plead guilty of the most serious, even a capital, offense, and thus dispense with all inquiry by a jury, and cannot, when informed against for a petty offense, waive a trial by jury? Article 6 of the Amendments, as we have seen, gives the accused a right to a trial by jury. But the same article gives \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n him the further right 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . and to have the assistance of counsel.' Is it possible that an accused cannot admit, and be bound by the admission, that a witness not present would testify to certain facts? Can it be that if he does not wish the assistance of counsel, and waives it, the trial is invalid? It seems only necessary to ask these questions to answer them. When there is no constitutional or statutory mandate, and no public policy prohibiting, an accused may waive any privilege which he is given the right to enjoy. Authorities in the state courts are in harmony with this thought. In Com. v. Dailey, 12 Cush. 80, the defendant in a misdemeanor case waived his right to a full panel, and consented to be tried by eleven jurors; and this action was sustained by the supreme court of Massachusetts. Chief Justice Shaw, delivering the opinion of the court, said (p. 83): 'He may waive any matter of form or substance, excepting only what may relate to the jurisdiction of the court.' The same doctrine was laid down in Murphy v. Com. 1 Met. (Ky.) 365; Tyra v. Com. 2 Met. (Ky.) 1, and in State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa, 578, 33 Am. Rep. 148, 2 N. W. 275. In Connelly v. State, 60 Ala. 89, 31 Am. Rep. 34, a statute authorizing the waiver of a jury was sustained. The same rule was made in State v. Worden, 46 Conn. 349, 33 Am. Rep. 27, which was a case of a felony. See also People v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 509, 542.\n We are of opinion that the waiver of a jury by the defendants in these cases, and the consent to trial by the court, was not in conflict with law, and the judgments are, therefore, affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Brown, and Mr. Justice Peckham concur in the views expressed in this opinion, although they dissent from the judgments on the ground of their dissent in No. 301.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissenting:\n These are criminal prosecutions based on the act of Con- \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 73]\n\u00a0\n gress of August 2d, 1886, entitled 'An Act Defining Butter, Also Imposing a Tax Upon and Regulating the Manufacture, Sale, Importation, and Exportation of Oleomargarine,' supplemented by the act of October 1st, 1890, and amended by the act of May 9th, 1902. 24 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 840, (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2228); 26 Stat. at L. 621, chap. 1244,  41 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2235); 32 Stat. at L. 193, chap. 784.\n The informations against Schick and Broadwell were substantially of the same character. Each charged that the defendant, a retail dealer in oleomargarine, unlawfully and knowingly purchased and received for sale certain oleomargarine which had not been stamped according to law.\n The parties, in writing, waived a jury, and agreed to submit the issues to the court. The accused, in each case, pleaded not guilty. Evidence having been introduced, the defendant in each case moved the court to render a verdict and judgment of not guilty, and that he be discharged, upon the ground that the above act of Congress, as amended, was in contravention of the Constitution of the United States in that it deprived the defendant and the oleomargarine manufacturers and dealers in the United States of their liberty and property without due process of law; was an unwarranted encroachment upon, and interference with, the police powers reserved to the several states and to the people of the United States; invested an inferior executive officer with the power finally and arbitrarily to determine judicial questions concerning property rights; and so arbitrarily discriminated against oleomargarine in favor of butter as to be repugnant to the fundamental principles of equality and justice that were inherent in the Constitution.\n In each case the motion was overruled, the defendant excepting. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment having been severally overruled, the court, no jury having been impaneled, found the defendant, in each case, guilty, and adjudged that he pay a fine of $50 and costs, and that execution issue therefor. From those judgments the present writs of error were prosecuted. \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 74]\n\u00a0\n The assignments of error here present the same questions of constitutional law that were raised on the motion to render judgment for the defendant; and, in addition, they question the action of the trial court in striking out and refusing to consider certain evidence.\n Upon the face of the record the question arises whether the court below, without the aid of a jury, had jurisdiction to ascertain the facts, and, finding the defendants severally guilty of the offense charged, to impose upon each the fine prescribed by the statute.\n I. That this is a criminal prosecution, and that the mode of procedure must be determined by the established rules governing the conduct of trials in criminal cases, is, in my judgment, not to be doubted. The record itself describes the information as a criminal information, and the case was tried as if it were a criminal prosecution. It never occurred to the trial court that it was a prosecution of any other kind. It is true that the act provides that all fines, penalties, and forfeitures imposed by it may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  19. But it is evident from the entire act that it makes all the violations of the provisions imposing a fine, or fine and imprisonment, or fine or imprisonment, criminal offenses, to be punished in such mode as was appropriate or allowable by the law of criminal procedure. Throughout the act, when a fine is imposed, the doing of the thing forbidden is described as an 'offense.' If a person carries on the business of a manufacturer of oleomargarine, without having paid the special tax, he is subject, besides being liable to pay the special tax, to be fined not less than $1,000, and not more than $5,000; if he carries on the business of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine without having paid the special tax therefor he is subject, besides being liable for the special tax, to be fined not less than $500, nor more than $2,000; and if he carries on the business of a retail dealer in oleomargarine, without having paid the special tax, he may be fined not less than $50, nor more than $500 for each and every \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 75]\n\u00a0\n offense.  4. Every person who knowingly sells or offers for sale, or delivers or offers to deliver, any oleomargarine in any other form than in new wooden or paper packages, as described, or who packs in any package any oleomargarine in a manner contrary to law, or who falsely brands any package or affixes any stamp on any package denoting a less amount of tax than that required by law, 'may be fined for each offense not more than $1, 000, and be imprisoned not more than two years.'  6. Every manufacturer of oleomargarine who neglects to affix the required label to a package containing oleomargarine made by him, or sold or offered for sale by or for him, and every person who removes any label so affixed may be 'fined $ 50 for each package in respect to which such offense is committed.'  7. Every officer of customs who permits imported oleomargarine 'to pass out of his custody or control without compliance by the owner or importer thereof with the provisions of this section relating thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not less than $1,000, nor more than $5,000, and imprisoned not less than six months, nor more than two years.'  10. Any person who wilfully neglects or refuses, when emptying a stamped package containing oleomargarine, to utterly destroy such stamps, 'shall for each such offense, be fined, not exceeding $50, and imprisoned not less than ten days, nor more than six months. And any person who fraudulently gives away or accepts from another, or who sells, buys, or uses for packing oleomargarine any such stamped package, shall, for each such offense, be fined not exceeding $100, and be imprisoned not more than one year.'  13. Any person who wilfully removes or defaces the stamps, marks, or brands on packages containing oleomargarine taxed as provided, is guilty 'of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, nor more than two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment for not less than thirty days, nor more than six months.'  15. Whenever any person engaged in carrying on the business of manufacturing oleomargarine, defrauds, or attempts to defraud, \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 76]\n\u00a0\n the United States of the tax on oleomargarine produced by him, or any part thereof, he forfeits the factory and manufacturing apparatus used by him, and all oleomargarine and all raw material for the production of oleomargarine found in the factory and on the factory premises, and 'shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, and be imprisoned not less than six months, nor more than three years.'  17.\n These sections are to be looked at in connection with  11, on which this prosecution is based. That section provides: 'That every person who knowingly purchases or receives for sale any oleomargarine which has not been branded or stamped according to law, shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such offense.'\n It is true that the word 'penalty' is used in several sections of this act. But it is not to be conclusively inferred therefrom that the offense described was not a crime, within the strictest meaning of that word. Referring to the words 'penalty,' 'liability,' and 'forfeiture,' this court has said: 'These words have been used by the great masters of Crown law and the elementary writers as synonymous with the word 'punishment,' in connection with crimes of the highest grade. Thus, Blackstone speaks of criminal law as that 'branch of jurisprudence which teaches of the nature, extent, and degrees of every crime, and adjusts to it its adequate and necessary penalty.' Alluding to the importance of this department of legal science, he says: 'The enacting of penalties to which a whole nation shall be subject should be calmly and maturely considered.' Referring to the unwise policy of inflicting capital punishment for certain comparatively slight offenses, he speaks of them as 'these outrageous penalties,' and frequently refers to laws that inflict the 'penalty of death.\" United States v.

Strictly and primarily, they denote punishment, whether corporal or pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the state for a crime or offense against its laws. . . . Penal laws, strictly and properly, are those imposing punishment for an offense committed against the state, and which, by the English and American Constitutions, the executive of the state has the power to pardon.' Besides, the act throughout uses the words 'fine,' and 'fined,'-words which, in their primary sense, import the punishment of a person convicted of crime.\n I cannot doubt, after a scrutiny of the entire act, that every offense prescribed by it, and for which a fine is imposed, was intended to be made and is a criminal offense,-a crime against the United States,-to be punished as such. Certainly the offenses prescribed in  4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 17 are crimes against the United States. If that be so, surely the offense prescribed in  11 is a crime, and not a mere penalty, recoverable only by some form of proceeding of a civil nature. This view is substantially conceded by the Solicitor General when he says that 'in view of the word 'offense' in  11 of the oleomargarine act, there is ground for saying that the penalty which it provides was imposed as a fine for the violation of what is made a misdemeanor.' If the United States could have proceeded in some form of civil action to recover the fine imposed by that section, it has not done so. It chose to proceed by criminal information, and the accused pleaded not guilty of the crime charged.\n II. So far it has been my object only to show that the offense charged was a crime against the United States. I now inquire as to the mode in which it may be legally ascertained whether an accused, pleading not guilty, has committed the \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 78]\n\u00a0\n crime charged against him? Has the law designated any particular tribunal, or prescribed any special mode, for trying the issue as to his guilt? The words of the Constitution upon this subject are clear and explicit. They leave no room for interpretation. Its express mandate is that 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.' Const. art. 3. When the Constitution was placed before the people for adoption or rejection, many deemed those words, explicit as they were, inadequate to secure all the benefits of a jury trial as it existed at common law.\n It is suggested that if any conflict exists between the absolute requirement in the original Constitution (art. 3,  2), that the 'trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury,' and the provision in the 6th Amendment, that the accused, in every criminal prosecution, 'shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,' etc., the latter, having been last adopted, must control. But there is no such conflict. Those who opposed the acceptance of the Constitution said, among other things, that the words of that instrument, strictly construed (art. 3,  2), admitted of a secret trial, or of one that might be indefinitely postponed to suit the purposes of the government, or of one taking place in a state or district other than that in which the crime was committed. The framers of the Constitution disclaimed any such evil purposes; but in order to meet the objections of its opponents, and to remove all possible ground of uneasiness on the subject, the 6th Amendment was adopted, in which the essential features of the trial required by  2 of article 3 are set forth. In other words, the trial required by that section is the trial referred to in the 6th Amendment. And the jury referred to in both the original Constitution and in the Amendments was, the authorities all agree, the historical jury of the common law, consisting of twelve persons, no more and no less, whose unanimous verdict was necessary to conviction. Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 349\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1061, 1066, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620; 2 Hale P. C. part 2, 161; 1 Chitty Crim. \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 79]\n\u00a0\n Law, 505; King v. St. Michael, 2 W. Bl. 719; Clyncard's Case, Cro. Eliz. part 2, p. 654. Mr. Justice Story said: 'The Constitution of the United States has exhibited great solicitude on the subject of the trial of crimes and has declared that the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by the jury; and has, in some cases, prescribed, and in others required Congress to prescribe, the place of trial. And certain amendments of the Constitution, in the nature of a Bill of Rights, have been adopted, which fortify and guard this inestimable right of trial by jury.' United States v. Gibert, 2 Sumn. 19, 37, Fed. Cas. No. 15,204. See also Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 873, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580; Natal v. Louisiana, \n139 \nU.S. 621, 624\n, 35 S. L. ed. 288, 289, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 636; 4 Bl. Com. 280; 1 Stephen's History of the Criminal Law, 123.\n The contention in the present prosecutions is that, although the positive constitutional injunction that the trial of all crimes shall be by jury furnishes an inflexible rule that may not be ignored in cases of felony, that rule, even where the accused pleads not guilty, may be disregarded altogether in a trial for a misdemeanor, provided he consents to be tried by the court without a jury. Plainly, such an exception is unauthorized by the Constitution if its words be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning. Nor, in my opinion, is it consistent with the fundamental rules of criminal procedure, as established and enforced at common law. In determining the meaning and scope of the words 'due process of law,' as used in the Constitution, the established rule is that 'we must examine the Constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions. If not found to be so, we must look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country.' Den ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 18 How. 272, 277, 15 L. ed. 372, 374. So, in ascertaining whether, under any circumstances, a criminal case may be tried in a Federal court \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 80]\n\u00a0\n without a jury,-the accused pleading not guilty,-we must inquire whether the Constitution forbids such an exercise of authority by the court, without a jury. If it does, that is the end of the matter; if it does not, then, and then only, may we look to such usages and modes of proceeding as existed at the common law for the trial of crimes before the adoption of the Constitution.\n Proceeding on that basis, we have seen that the Constitution expressly requires that the trial of all crimes, except impeachment, shall be by jury; and I assert, with confidence, that no precedent can be found at common law for the trial by the court, without a jury, of any crimes except those described in adjudged cases and by elementary authorities as minor or petty offenses involved in the internal police of the state, and those could be tried summarily by some court or officer, without the intervention of a jury, only when thereunto authorized by an act of Parliament. Except in cases of contempt, the common law, Blackstone says, was a stranger to the summary proceedings authorized by acts of Parliament. Bank 4, chap. 20, p. 280. I am not aware of, nor has there been cited, any case in England in which, after Magna Charta, and prior to the adoption of our Constitution, a court, tribunal, officer, or commissioner has, without a jury, even in the case of a petty offense, determined the question of crime or no crime, when the defendant pleaded not guilty, unless the authority to do so was expressly conferred by an act of Parliament. The exceptions to the rule at common law that all crimes must be tried by a jury were in the mind of this court when, in Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 557\n, 32 S. L. ed. 223, 228, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301, 1307, it said: 'Except in that class or grade of offenses called petty offenses, which, according to the common law, may be proceeded against summarily in any tribunal legally constituted for that purpose, the gauranty of an impartial jury to the accused in a criminal prosecution, conducted either in the name, or by or under the authority of the United States, secures to him the right to enjoy that mode of trial from the first moment, and in what- \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 81]\n\u00a0\n ever court, he is put on trial for the offense charged. In such cases a judgment of conviction, not based upon a verdict of guilty by a jury, is void.'\n If, in analogy to the powers exercised by the Parliament of England prior to the adoption of our Constitution, it should be held that Congress could treat the particular crime here in question as a petty offense, triable by the court, without a jury, or with a jury of less than twelve persons, it is sufficient to say that Congress has not legislated to that effect in respect of the offense charged against these defendants, or of any other offense defined in the acts relating to oleomargarine. If it has the power to do so, Congress has not assumed, directly or indirectly, to withdraw such offenses from the operation of the constitutional provision that the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury. And the question is whether, in the face of that explicit provision, and in the absence of any statute authorizing it to be done, the court, a jury being waived, has jurisdiction to try the accused for the crime charged.\n In this connection we are confronted with the broad statement, found in some adjudged cases as well as in elementary treatises, to the effect that a person is entitled to waive any constitutional right, of whatever nature, that he possesses, and thereby preclude himself from invoking the authority of the Constitution for the protection or enforcement of that right. It is suggested that even when charged with murder he may plead guilty, and that the court thereupon, without the intervention of a jury, may pronounce such judgment as the law permits or authorizes. And it is confidently asked by those who make that suggestion, Why may not one charged with a misdemeanor, and pleading not guilty, waive a jury altogether, and consent to be tried by the court? This argument will not stand the test of reason. It proceeds upon the ground that jurisdiction to try a criminal case may be given by consent of the accused and the prosecutor. But such consent could have no legal efficacy. Undoubtedly one accused of \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 82]\n\u00a0\n murder may plead guilty. But in doing so he renders a trial unnecessary. The Constitution does not prohibit an accused from pleading guilty. His right to do so was recognized long before the adoption of that instrument; and it was never supposed that such a plea impaired the force of the requirement that a trial for crime, under a plea of not guilty, shall be by jury. It is not to be assumed that the Constitution intended, when preserving the right of trial by jury, to change any essential rule of criminal practice established at the common law, before the adoption of that instrument. When the accused pleads guilty before a lawful tribunal he admits every material fact well averred in the indictment or information, and there is no issue to be tried; no facts are to be found; no trial occurs. After such a plea nothing remains to be done except that the court shall pronounce judgment upon the facts voluntarily confessed by the accused. What the Constitution requires is that the trial of a crime shall be by jury. If the accused pleads not guilty, there must, of necessity, be a trial; for by that plea he puts 'himself on his country, which country the jury are;' he contests, by that plea, every fact necessary to establish his guilt; he is presumed to be innocent; nothing is confessed; and the facts necessary to show guilt must be judicially ascertained, in the mode prescribed by law, before any judgment can be rendered. But the vital inquiry is, In what way, when the defendant pleads not guilty, are the facts to be ascertained, and the plea of not guilty overcome? Under the express words of the Constitution the answer must be: By trial before a jury of twelve persons, organized to determine whether the charge of guilt be true; the function of the court being simply to conduct the trial, and render a judgment in accordance with the verdict of the jury as to the facts. The court and the jury, not separately, but together, constitute the appointed tribunal which alone, under the law, can try the question of crime, the commission of which by the accused is put in issue by a plea of not guilty.\n There are some things so vital in their character that they \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 83]\n\u00a0\n may not be legally done or legally omitted in a criminal prosecution, even with the consent of the accused. This is abundantly established by authority. The grounds upon which the decisions rest are, upon principle, applicable alike in cases of felonies and misdemeanors, although the consequences to the accused may be more evident as well as more serious in the former than in the latter cases. Certain it is, that felonies and misdemeanors are equally crimes within the meaning of the constitutional provision that the trial of all crimes shall be by jury, and there is no warrant to construe that provision as if it read, 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment and in misdemeanors, shall be by jury.'\n Let us look at some of the authorities in cases both of felonies and misdemeanors, and ascertain whether the consent, express or implied, of the accused can have the effect to dispense with the mode of trial appointed by law for criminal cases. As the question here presented has never been decided by this court, and is of importance, a somewhat extended reference to authorities is justified.\n The first case to which I call attention is Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 574, 579\n, 28 S. L. ed. 262, 265, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 202. That was a case of murder arising in Utah while a territory. It appeared that the trial, by triers appointed by the court, of challenges of proposed jurors, was not had in the presence of the accused. It was there argued that his presence at the trial of such an issue was a privilege which he was entitled to waive, and that the entire proceedings against him should not fail because he chose not to exercise that privilege. This court, however, held that the trial of challenges could not legally take place except in the actual presence of the accused. In dealing with the suggestion that the right of the accused to be present before the triers was waived by his failure to object to their retirement from the court room, or to the trial of the several challenges in his absence, it was said: 'We are of opinion that it was not within the power of the accused or his counsel to dispense with the statutory requirement as to his personal presence at the trial. \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 84]\n\u00a0\n The argument to the contrary necessarily proceeds upon the ground that he alone is concerned as to the mode by which he may be deprived of his life or liberty, and that the chief object of the prosecution is to punish him for the crime charged. But this is a mistaken view as well of the relations which the accused holds to the public as of the end of human punishment. The natural life, says Blackstone, 'cannot legally be disposed of or destroyed by any individual, neither by the person himself, nor by any other of his fellow creatures, merely upon their own authority.' 1 Bl. Com. 133. The public has an interest in his life and liberty. Neither can be lawfully taken except in the mode prescribed by law. That which the law makes essential in proceedings involving the deprivation of life or liberty cannot be dispensed with or affected by the consent of the accused, much less by his mere failure, when on trial and in custody, to object to unauthorized methods.' 4 Bl. Com. 11.\n In Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 353\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1061, 1067, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620, 624, which was a case of grand larceny, charged to have been committed while Utah was a territory (the trial occurring after Utah became a state), one of the questions was whether the trial by a jury composed of eight jurors, as authorized by the statutes of the state, was a legal trial for a crime committed when Utah was a territory under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. It was contended that, as the accused did not object, until after verdict, to a trial by a jury of eight persons, he should not be heard to say that the trial was in violation of his constitutional rights. This court overruled that contention, saying: 'It is sufficient to say that it was not in the power of one accused of felony, by consent expressly given or by his silence, to authorize a jury of only eight persons to pass upon the question of his guilt. The law in force when this crime was committed did not permit any tribunal to deprive him of his liberty, except one constituted of a court and a jury of twelve persons.' After referring to Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 574, 579\n, 28 S. L. ed. 262, 265, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 202, the court proceeded: 'If one under trial for a felony \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 85]\n\u00a0\n the punishment of which is confinement in a penitentiary could not legally consent that the trial proceed in his absence, still less could he assent to be deprived of his liberty by a tribunal not authorized by law to determine his guilt.'\n'The infirmity,' says Cooley, 'in case of a trial by a jury of less than twelve, by consent, would be that the tribunal would be one unknown to the law, created by mere voluntary act of the parties; and it would in effect be an attempt to submit to a species of arbitration the question whether the accused has been guilty of an offense against the state.' Const. Lim. 319.\n\n A leading case is that of Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128, 136. Its doctrines have been widely accepted as based upon a sound interpretation of constitutional provisions relating to criminal prosecutions. The court of appeals of New York said: 'These considerations make it apparent that the right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to affect, by consent, the conduct of the case, should be much more limited than in civil actions. It should not be permitted to extent so far as to work radical changes in great and leading provisions as to the organization of the tribunals or the mode of proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and the laws. Effect may justly and safely be given to such consent in many particulars; and the law does, in respect to various matters, regard and act upon it as valid. Objections to jurors may be waived; the court may be substituted for triers to dispose of challenges to jurors; secondary in place of primary evidence may be received; admissions of facts are allowed; and in similar particulars, as well as in relation to mere formal proceedings generally, consent will render valid what without it would be erroneous. A plea of guilty to any indictment, whatever may be the grade of the crime, will be received and acted upon if it is made clearly to appear that the nature and effect of it are understood by the accused. In such a case the preliminary investigation of a grant jury, with the admission of the accusation in the indictment, is supposed \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 86]\n\u00a0\n to be a sufficient safeguard to the public interests. But when issue is joined upon an indictment, the trial must be by the tribunal and in the mode which the Constitution and laws provide, without any essential change. The public officer prosecuting for the people has no authority to consent to such a change, nor has the defendant. Applying the above reasoning to the present case, the conclusion necessarily follows that the consent of the plaintiff in error to the withdrawal of one juror, and that the remaining eleven might render a verdict, could not lawfully be recognized by the court, at the circuit, and was a nullity. If a deficiency of one juror might be waived, there appears to be no good reason why a deficiency of eleven might not be; and it is difficult to say why, upon the same principle, the entire panel might not be dispensed with, and the trial committed to the court alone. It would be a highly dangerous innovation, in reference to criminal cases, upon the ancient and invaluable institution of trial by jury, and the Constitution and laws establishing and securing that mode of trial, for the court to allow of any number short of a full panel of twelve jurors, and we think it ought not to be tolerated.'\n Upon the general question whether the consent or silence of the defendant can excuse the failure of the court at the trial to enforce such essential rules as are prescribed by law for the trial of criminal cases, the case of Hill v. People, 16 Mich. 351, 356-358, is instructive. That was a case of murder. The defendant was found guilty, and after the trial it was discovered that one of the jurors was disqualified under the statutes of Michigan. But that fact was unknown to the accused and his counsel until after the rendition of the verdict. It was contended by the state that by neglecting to challenge that juror, the accused lost the right to avail himself of the objection; and was to be deemed to have thereby waived all objections to the juror or to a trial by eleven qualified jurors. It should be here observed that the Constitution of Michigan preserved the \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 87]\n\u00a0\n right, in all criminal prosecutions, to 'a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury, which may consist of less than twelve men in all courts not of record.' Looking at the case as one in which the trial had been by eleven competent jurors only, the court considered the general question of waiver as applicable to criminal cases. Speaking by Judge Christiancy, and observing that under the state Constitution there could be no reasonable doubt of the competency of parties in civil cases to waive such an objection, or to stipulate for a trial by jury of less than twelve, the court said: 'But a criminal prosecution, in which the people in their sovereign capacity prosecute for a crime against the laws of the whole society, and seek to subject the defendant to punishment, must, it seems to us, be considered as a proceeding in invitum, against the will of the defendant throughout, so far as relates to a question of this kind, or any question as to the legal constitution of the court or jury by which he is to be tried. It would be adding materially to the generally recognized force of the obligation of contracts to hold that a defendant charged with a crime might, without a trial, enter into a building contract with the prosecuting attorney (representing the state) to go to the penitentiary for a certain number of years in satisfaction for the offense. And yet it would approximate such a position, to hold that he might be bound by a contract providing for a trial before a court or jury unknown to the Constitution or the laws, the result of which trial might be to place him in the same penitentiary. The true theory, we think, is that the people, in their political or sovereign capacity, assume to provide by law the proper tribunals and modes of trial for offenses, without consulting the wishes of the defendant as such; and upon them, therefore, devolves the responsibility, not only of enacting such laws, but of carrying them into effect, by furnishing the tribunals, the panels of jurors, and other safeguards for his trial, in accordance with the Constitution, which secures his rights.'\n The court added some general observations which may well \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 88]\n\u00a0\n be heeded by every one charged with the administration of the criminal laws. It said: 'But independent of all theories, and as a practical question, we think there would be great danger in holding it competent for a defendant in a criminal case, by waiver or stipulation, to give authority which it could not otherwise possess, to a jury of less than twelve men, for his trial and conviction; or to deprive himself in any way of the safeguards which the Constitution has provided him, in the unanimous agreement of twelve men qualified to serve as jurors by the general laws of the land. Let it once be settled that a defendant may thus waive this constitutional right, and no one can foresee the extent of the evils which might follow; but the whole judicial history of the past must admonish us that very serious evils should be apprehended, and that every step taken in that direction would tend to increase the danger. One act or neglect might be recognized as a waiver in one case, and another in another, until the constitutional safeguards might be substantially frittered away. The only safe course is to meet the danger in limine, and prevent the first step in the wrong direction. It is the duty of courts to see that the constitutional rights of a defendant in a criminal case shall not be violated, however negligent he may be in raising the objection. It is in such cases, emphatically, that consent should not be allowed to give jurisdiction.'\n In State v. Carman, 63 Iowa, 130, 131, 50 Am. Rep. 741, 742, 18 N. W. 691, which was the case of an assault with an attempt to commit murder, the supreme court of Iowa said: 'In our Code of Civil Practice it is provided that 'issues of fact in an action in an ordinary proceeding must be tried by a jury, unless the the same is waived.'  2740. In our Code of Criminal Procedure there is no provision for the waiver of a jury. On the other hand, it is provided that 'an issue of fact must be tried by a jury of the county in which the indictment is found, unless a change of venue has been awarded.'  4350. We regard this provision as excluding the jurisdiction of the court, without a jury, to try such issue. The question presented is not as to the waiver of \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 89]\n\u00a0\n mere statutory privilege, but an imperative provision, based, as we view it, upon the soundest conception of public policy. Life and liberty are too sacred to be placed at the disposal of any one man, and always will be, so long as man is fallible. The innocent person, unduly influenced by his consciousness of innocence, and placing undue confidence in his evidence, would, when charged with crime, be the one most easily induced to waive his safeguards. There is no resemblance between such a case and that of a person pleading guilty. In the latter case there is no trial but mere judgment upon the plea. If the language of the statute were less imperative than it is, the adjudications would support us in reaching the same conclusion.'\n In State v. Mansfield, 41 Mo. 470, 476, which involved the question of the right of the accused in capital crimes and felonies to waive his right to a jury of twelve persons, after referring to Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128, the supreme court of Missouri, speaking by Judge Wagner, conceded that in cases of misdemeanor, created by statute, the legislature, under the laws of that state, might provide for their prosecution in a summary way, without the formality of an indictment, and that the accused could waive a jury, or agree on a certain number. But there was no such statute in Missouri, and the court, in respect of the general question of the waiver of a jury, said: 'Another good and sufficient reason, it occurs to us, is, that the prisoner's consent cannot change the law. His right to be tried by a jury of twelve men is not a mere privilege; it is a positive requirement of the law. He can unquestionably waive many of his legal rights or privileges. He may agree to certain facts, and dispense with formal proofs; he may consent to the introduction of evidence not strictly legal, or forbear to interpose challenges to the jurors; but he has no power to consent to the creation of a new tribunal unknown to the law, to try his offense. The law, in its wisdom, has declared what shall be a legal jury in the trial of criminal cases; that it shall be composed of twelve; and a defendant, \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 90]\n\u00a0\n when he is upon trial, cannot be permitted to change the law, and substitute another and a different tribunal to pass upon his guilt or innocence. The law as to criminal trials should be based upon fixed standards, and should be clear, definite, and uniform, and absolute. If one juror can be withdrawn, there is no reason why six or eight may not be, not thus the accused, through persuasion or other causes, may have his life put in jeopardy, or be deprived of his liberty, through a body constituted in a manner unknown to the law. Aside from the illegality of such a procedure, public policy condemns it. The prisoner is not in a condition to exercise a free and independent choice without often creating prejudice against him.'\n In Wilson v. State, 16 Ark. 601, 608, which was a case of larceny, the supreme court of Arkansas said: 'Hence there would seem to be no other mode for the trial of a criminal issue than that by jury. The difficulty is not obviated by any waiver of this mode of trial, because the legislature has provided no other mode, in lieu of it, in such an event, as it has in civil cases. Nothing short of a confession of the facts, or the finding of them by the verdict of the jury, can regularly authorize the judgment of the court. If the accused would not only waive his right to a trial by jury, but go further, and withdraw his plea, and then confess the facts charged against him in the indictment, the court would be authorized to render a judgment against him; but so long as his plea of not guilty is in, there is no mode by which the court can dispose of it, although the accused may waive a trial by jury, with all its attendant privileges, and desire ever so much that the issue may be disposed of by a reference of it to the judge, or any other referee or arbitrator, and the prosecuting attorney may desire the same, and act in concert with the accused; for the simple reason that the law makes no provision for any such referee or arbitrator in criminal cases. The only provision is for a confession of the facts, or a trial by jury to determine them.'\n A leading case upon the subject of trial by jury is that of \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 91]\n\u00a0\n Work v. State of Ohio, 2 Ohio St. 296, 302, 305, 59 Am. Dec. 671, 672, 674. That was an information charging the defendant with assault and battery. The trial took place under an act of the Ohio legislature, which permitted a trial in such a case by a jury of six men, notwithstanding the Constitution of Ohio provided that the right of trial by jury should be inviolate. The defendant pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and costs. In discussing the history of trial by jury, the court, speaking by Judge Ranney, said: 'In what does the privilege of this great bulwark of personal liberty consist? The Constitution furnishes no answer, nor was it necessary that it should. If ages of uninterrupted use can give significance to language, the right of jury trial and the habeas corpus stand as representatives of ideas as certain and definite as any other in the whole range of legal learning. The institution of the jury, referred to in our Constitution, and its benefits secured to every person accused of crime, is precisely the same in every substantial respect, as that recognized in the great charter, and its benefits secured to the freemen of England, and again and again acknowledged in fundamental compacts as the great safeguard of life, liberty, and property; the same, brought to this continent by our forefathers, and perseveringly claimed as their birthright, in every contest with arbitrary power, and finally, an invasion of its privileges prominently assigned as one of the causes which was to justify them in the eyes of mankind in waging the contest which resulted in independence. . . . We are of opinion it was this very tribunal, thus constituted, that those who framed and adopted the Constitution of this state intended to perpetuate, and make the safeguard of innocence, by securing its benefits to every person accused of crime, in any of its courts. there is certainly nothing in our history which points to a different conclusion. For half a century before its adoption, similar provisions had been so considered and acted upon. Until the passage of this law, no person had ever been convicted of crime, by less than the \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 92]\n\u00a0\n concurring assent of twelve of his peers; and no law has ever attempted to authorize it to be done. If the power exists to diminish the number of the jury, it may be applied to all cases, and it may be reduced to two as well as to six. The same constitutional provision that secures the right in a charge involving the life of the accused, secures it also in every other criminal case. It is no answer to say that this would not likely be done. If it had been deemed safe to leave it to the discretion of the general assembly, no constitutional provision was needed; but, whether needed or not, it has been ordained by a power which both the general assembly and this court are bound to obey.' Again: 'But, without pursuing these considerations further, our opinion is, that the essential and distinguishing features of the trial by jury as known at common law, and generally, if not universally, adopted in this country, were intended to be preserved, and its benefits secured to the accused in all criminal cases, by the constitutional provisions referred to. That it is beyond the power of the general assembly to impair the right, or materially change its character; that the number of jurors cannot be diminished, or a verdict authorized, short of a unanimous concurrence of all the jurors. It follows that the act under which this conviction was obtained, in so far as it provides for a jury of six only, and authorizes a conviction upon their finding, is unconstitutional and void.'\n In United States v. Taylor, 3 McCrary, 500, 11 Fed. 470, which was a criminal prosecution by information for the offense of carrying on the business of a retail dealer in liquors without having paid the special taxes required by law, the main question was as to the authority of the court to direct a verdict of guilty under the evidence. It was held by Judge McCrary that no such power existed in the court. In the course of his opinion he said that the constitutional guaranty of a jury in a criminal case was a right that could not be waived, and that such a trial before the court, by the prisoner's consent, was erroneous. It appears from the report of that case that Mr. \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 93]\n\u00a0\n Justice Miller was consulted by Judge McCrary, and concurred in the latter's views.\n Among the cases cited by Judge McCrary was State v. Maine, 27 Conn. 281, which was a criminal information for placing a nuisance in a highway. The defendant pleaded not guilty. The case, by agreement of the parties, was tried by the court, which found the facts, and reserved the questions of law arising thereon for the advice of the supreme court of errors. The judges of the latter court unanimously held that, 'as no statute conferred on the superior court the power to try this or any other criminal charge, excepting through the intervention of a jury, the court below could not legally try the case in the manner in which it had done, and would not be able to render a legal judgment on the facts, if the advice of this court was given upon them. They therefore refused to entertain the case.'\n In Neales v. State, 10 Mo. 498, which is an indictment for unlawfully carrying on the business of a dram-shop keeper without having a license therefor, it appears that the defendant pleaded not guilty, and neither party requiring a jury, the case was submitted to the court, who found him guilty, and assessed a fine of $30 against him. The supreme court of Missouri, in which state there was a constitutional provision providing that the right of trial by jury should remain inviolate, said: 'Another objection, equally fatal to the judgment, was the trial of the cause by the court, on the plea of not guilty. It has heretofore been virtually decided by this court, in two cases, that unless the defendant pleads guilty to the charge contained in the indictment, the court cannot try the issue and assess a fine against him. Thomas v. State, 6 Mo. 457; Ross v. State, 9 Mo. 687. It is exclusively the province of a jury to try the issue of not guilty and the consent of the defendant for the court to try the same cannot confer such power on the court.'\n A case directly in point is that of State v. Stewart, 89 N. C. 563, 564. That was an indictment for an assault and battery. \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 94]\n\u00a0\n The defendant pleaded not guilty. A jury trial was waived, the court found the facts, and adjudged the accused guilty. The judgment was arrested and the state appealed. The supreme court of North Carolina said: 'It is a fundamental principle of the common law, declared in 'Magna Charta,' and again in our Bill of Rights, that 'no person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good and lawful men, in open court.' Art. 1,  13. The only exception to this is where the legislature may provide other means of trial for petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal,-proviso in same section. This is not one of the petty misdemeanors embraced in the proviso; and if it was, no such means of trial as that adopted in this case has been provided by the legislature. The court here has undertaken to serve in the double capacity of judge and jury, and try the defendant without a jury, which it had no authority to do, even with the consent of the prisoner.'\n Later, in State v. Holt, 90 N. C. 749, 754, 47 Am. Rep. 544, 548,- which was an indictment for cruelty to animals,-the same court, after observing that it was the province and duty of the judiciary to watch over and protect the fundamental rights, in all matters that come before them, said: 'There was not the remotest purpose in this case, we are sure, to infringe the right of trial by jury in a criminal action, but for convenience sake and to save time (because the facts were not disputed) the facts of the case were agreed upon by the state and the defendant, and submitted to the judge, instead of letting a jury hear the evidence, and render a verdict upon the issue, or find a special verdict. In our judgment, this was not only irregular, but wholly without the sanction of law. There is no statute that authorizes such procedure, and the Constitution forbids it. 'No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good and lawful men, in open court.' No jury was impaneled to try the issue; there was no verdict of a jury; there was no conviction. The judgment of the court had nothing to warrant it, and there was nothing upon \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 95]\n\u00a0\n which it could properly rest. The defendant could not consent to a conviction by the court. It had no authority to try the issue of fact raised by the pleadings. The defendant did not plead guilty; he did not enter the plea of nolo contendere, or submit; he pleaded autrefois convict, and a jury must try the issue raised by that plea. State v. Stewart, 89 N. C. 563; State v. Moss, 47 N. C. (2 Jones L.) 66; 1 Bishop, Crim. Pl.  759, and cases there cited; Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128. The legislature has not provided a means for the trial of cases like this, different from the ordinary method provided by law. The court erred in passing upon the facts agreed upon and submitted to it without the finding of a jury, and for such error the judgment must be reversed and the court proceed to dispose of the case according to law.'\n Running through the adjudged cases is the thought that the facts necessary to be proved in order to sustain the charge of crime, where the plea is not guilty, must be ascertained in the mode ordained by law for such purpose. 'When, therefore,' says Blackstone, 'a prisoner on his arraignment hath pleaded not guilty, and for his trial hath put himself upon the country, which country the jury are, the sheriff of the county must return a panel of jurors, liberos et legales homines, de vicineto.' Book 4, chap. 27, *350. Now, all will agree that when the crime charged is a felony, a trial in a circuit or district court of the United States, even with the consent of the accused, without a jury composed of twelve persons, would be unauthorized and unavailing for any legal purpose. Why? Because, and only because, the law, the supreme law of the land, has declared that the trial of all crimes shall be by jury. And, perhaps, all will agree that the constitutional injunction applies with like force to such misdemeanors as by statute are punishable with imprisonment, and that a circuit or district court of the United States is without jurisdiction, under a plea of not guilty, no jury being impaneled, to try any crime against the United States involving life or liberty. The consent of the accused in such a case certainly cannot confer upon the court \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 96]\n\u00a0\n authority to try the crime in a mode inconsistent with the one prescribed by the law.\n In my judgment, the same principle must apply in the present case, although a fine only can be imposed. The case is embraced by the very words of the Constitution; for the offense charged is a crime,-none the less a crime because only a fine is involved,-and the constitutional mandate is that the trial of all crimes, except impeachment, shall be by jury. By what authority can a Federal court except from the operation of the constitutional mandate a crime punishable by fine? It is said that only the property of the accused can be affected, and, therefore, to his consent in this criminal case should be accorded the same effect as is given to his consent in a purely civil case to which he might be a party, and which involved no element of crime. In this view I cannot concur. Something more than property is involved in a criminal case, although the penalty imposed may be simply a fine. Whether the accused has violated the laws of his country, and whether he shall be branded by the judgment of a court as a criminal, are things of more consequence to the public than property the value of which is to be measured in money. What shall constitute a crime, how that crime shall be tried, and in what way the guilt of the accused shall be manifested when he pleads not guilty, are exclusively for the government to declare and regulate, and it is not for the accused and the prosecutor, by the device of an agreement between them, to evade the requirements of the Constitution and provide a tribunal for the determination of the issue of crime or no crime different from that designated by the law. Crime or no crime, if the plea be not guilty, can be established in a court of the United States only by the verdict of a jury.\n Undoubtedly, as already indicated, there were petty or minor crimes which, at common law, could be tried without a jury, and it may be assumed for the purposes of this case, that the constitutional provision that all crimes except im- \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 97]\n\u00a0\n peachment shall be tried by jury is to be interpreted in the light of that fact. But, it may be repeated, that the trial, even of such cases, without a jury, was contrary to the genius of the common law, and was allowed by the courts only in obedience to acts of Parliament, which was not bound by a written constitution, and whose authority in matters of legislation was omnipotent, and, therefore, not to be disputed by any English court. An enumeration of all crimes against the United States which may be reasonably declared to belong to the class known at the common law as petty offenses, punishable under legislative sanction without the intervention of a jury, need not here be attempted. Nor is it necessary to express any final judgment upon the question whether the particular crime here involved might, by statute, be placed in that class and tried without a jury. It is enough to say that, even if Congress could place it in that class, and authorize its trial by summary proceedings, without a jury, or with a jury of less than twelve, it has not done so. The case, therefore, is controlled by the express constitutional injunction that all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be tried by a jury. The agreement of the accused and the prosecutor cannot confer jurisdiction, much less have the effect to displace the mode of trial established by the fundamental law, and substitute for it one inconsistent with the principles of the common law, as unmodified by any valid statute.\n It is said that the nature of the offense and the amount of punishment prescribed must determine whether it is to be classed among serious or petty offenses. This, I take it, means that it is for the court, in the exercise of its inherent powers, to determine whether the offense is a serious one, to be tried alone by a jury, or a petty one, which may be tried without a jury. But the judiciary had no such function at common law. No court at common law assumed, without a jury, to try any offense, however trivial or petty, except under the authority of a statute conferring authority to that end. If the offense is punishable only by a fine of $50, \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 98]\n\u00a0\n as is the case here,-is it to be deemed a petty offense? And yet is one punable by a fine of $500 to be deemed a serious one? Must there not be some fixed rule or limit on the subject? In my judgment, the Constitution establishes a rule which must be respected by every branch of the government. Yet, under the principles now announced, an offense punishable by a fine of five or ten thousand dollars may be regarded-if the court so wills-as a petty offense, triable without a jury. I cannot understand where the judiciary derives its authority to prescribe any rule on the subject, in face of the absolute constitutional requirement that all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be tried by a jury, and in face of the further significant fact that no court at common law ever assumed to regard any crime, however trivial, as triable without a jury, except under express legislative sanction.\n Again, it is said that in the original draft of the Constitution the words were 'the trial of all criminal offenses . . . shall be by jury,' and that these words were changed in the Convention so as to read 'the trial of all crimes.' Strangely enough, it is supposed that this change of words justifies the conclusion that the framers of the Constitution intended to dispense with a jury in such criminal offenses as the courts, uncontrolled by statute, deemed petty, as contrasted with those that they deemed serious. To say that 'crimes' means something different from 'criminal offenses' is something that I cannot comprehend. A crime is a criminal offense and a criminal offense is a crime. But the contention of the prosecution, even if sound, does not answer the suggestion that, at common law, it was never the province of a court, by any inherent power it possessed, to prescribe what criminal offenses or crimes were triable, and what need not be tried, by jury. My point is that no criminal offense or crime against the United States can be tried except by jury, if the plea be not guilty, unless it be a petty offense or crime, and unless the legislative department declares that it may be so \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 99]\n\u00a0\n tried. If the offense or crime be, in reality, in its essence, a petty one, then Congress may authorize it to be tried without a jury. But Congress has not so declared in respect of the offense or crime charged against the present defendant. The trial by jury is not one of form, but of the very substance of the mode prescribed for the trial of crimes. It may not be waived merely by the consent of the accused and the prosecutor. In the present case the court, as I think, entrenches upon the domain of the legislative department of the government. It assumes, without authority, to prescribe a rule of criminal procedure which Congress has not, in its wisdom, undertaken to prescribe. It has made, not declared, law. There is no tendency, in these latter days, more dangerous than the assumption by one department of the government of powers that belong to another department.\n It is contended that this mode of trial, at least in misdemeanors involving only a fine, ought to be sanctioned,-indeed, encouraged,-as convenient both for the government and the accused. What was said by Blackstone when referring to summary proceedings authorized by acts of Parliament in particular cases may well be repeated, at this day, whenever it is proposed, upon grounds of convenience, to dispense with juries in criminal prosecutions, and thereby introduce a new mode for the trial of crimes. He said: 'And, however convenient these may appear at first (as doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most convenient), yet let it be again remembered, that delays and little inconveniences in the forms of justice are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our Constitution; and that, though begun in trifles, the precedent may gradually increase and spread, to the utter disuse of juries in questions of the most momentous concern.' Book 4, chap. 27, p. 350.\n I insist that, as the offense charged in each of these cases \n\n[195 U.S. 65, 100]\n\u00a0\n was a crime against the United States; as the Constitution expressly declares, without qualification, that the trial of all crimes, except impeachment, shall be by jury; as Congress has not assumed to declare that this case and like ones may be tried without a jury, the parties assenting; and as the trial of these cases by the court alone, without a jury, has no other sanction than the consent of the accused and the District Attorney, the judgment in each case should be reversed, and each case remanded, with directions to set aside the judgment, grant a new trial, and take such further proceedings as may be in conformity with law. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHWEER v.

In return to a rule, one of the respondents alleged that he had paid the money over to the other, and denied the jurisdiction of the court. The other, Mrs. Schweer, denied that she had or ever had had any money belonging or due to the estate, and denied jurisdiction. The matter was heard before a referee, who made findings of fact and conlusions of law, and ordered the return of the money. It was then carried to the district court and there heard de novo. The district court sustained the referee, and entered decree for the payment of the money to the trustee. Thereupon an appeal was taken directly to this court on the \n\n[195 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n ground that the case fell within the first of the classes of cases enumerated in  5 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U.

W. 304.\n The following facts (among others) were found by the trial court:\n'1. The plaintiff is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of Minnesota, and the defendants are husband and wife.\n\n'2. In 1876, township fifty-seven north of range seventeen west, in St. Louis county, Minnesota, was ordered by the General Land Office of the United States to be surveyed, and a contract for the survey thereof was made by the United States surveyor general of the state of Minnesota with one H. S. Howe, who, by said contract, was constituted a deputy United States surveyor for said purpose. Under said contract said Howe was required, and undertook and agreed, to survey said township, to run out all section lines, and to set posts marking all section and quarter section corners throughout said township where the same could be marked upon the ground, and accurately to meander and establish upon the ground meander posts of all lakes and streams found to exist within said township.\n\n'3. Thereafter said Howe ran and marked the exterior lines of said township, except the south township line, which had been previously surveyed, and set posts at all section and quarter section corners on said three exterior lines. He also set a meander post upon the north line of said township as surveyed by him, where said line running west from the northeast corner of said township first encountered the shore of Ely lake, or, as it is sometimes called, Cedar Island lake.\n\n'4. No survey of the interior of said township was ever made, and no section lines within said township were ever run by said Howe, with the possible exception of the west line of section 36 thereof, and no section or quarter section corners were ever located, established, or marked by him (with the possible exception of the northwest corner of section 36 aforesaid), and \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n none of the streams or permanent lakes (of which there were several) within said township were meandered by him, and no posts of any description were ever set, nor any lines or bearing trees ever blazed, within said township, with the possible exception of a corner post at the northwest corner of said section 36.\n\n'5. Said Howe made and filed with the United States surveyor general of the state of Minnesota what purported to be field notes of a survey of said township made by him under said contract, purporting to give the length and directions of all interior section lines in said township, the location of all sections and quarter section posts, and the bearing trees thereof, the character of the soil and timber in said township, and all other data and information required by the statutes of the United States and the rules of the United States General Land Office to be ascertained and reported by deputy surveyors in due course of making surveys of public lands.\n\n'6. With the exception of the description of the survey of the three exterior boundary lines of said township actually run by him, said field notes returned by said Howe were imaginary and fictitious, and the purported facts and data contained therein were not based upon any personal knowledge or inspection of the interior of said township, and were, in fact, false and erroneous.\n\n'7. From said purported field notes it appears that there existed in the northerly part of said township, lying in sections 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, and 11 thereof, a lake known as Ely lake, or Cedar Island lake, with surface area, as indicated in said field notes, of 1,800 acres; in fact, instead of having an area of about 1,800 acres, said lake then was and still is a body of water not exceeding 800 acres in area. It is a permanent, deep, and navigable lake, having high, steep, and heavily timbered banks, except about the outlet thereof. Said lake does not, in fact, touch section 11 at all, and covers only an area of very small extent (less than one half of a 40-acre tract) in the southeast corner of section \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n 4. Between the actual water line of said lake and the meander line thereof, as returned by the purported field notes of said Howe, there were, at the time of the survey, and still are, at least 1,000 acres of high, tillable land, which has never been a part of the lake, and which was and is heavily timbered with trees of more than a century's growth and growing down to the water's edge.\n\n'8. The field notes and report of survey made and filed by said Howe were approved by the surveyor general for the district of Minnesota, August 7, 1876, and a plat of said township was made in accordance with said purported filed notes under the direction of said surveyor general, and was approved by him on said 7th day of August, 1876, and a duly certified copy thereof was transmitted by him to the proper local United States land office on the 24th day of August, 1876, and another duly certified copy of the same was by him forwarded to the General Land Office of the United States, and filed therein August 23, 1876, and was by that office accepted as representing a correct survey of said township, and as the official plat thereof. Such survey and plat of said township were the only ones ever made by or under the authority of the United States government.'\n\n The plat, which is to be found at page 43 of 189 United States Reports, 47 L. ed. 702, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602, illustrates with sufficient accuracy the township in which the lands in question lie, and it delineates the meandering of Cedar Island lake, the outer meander line representing that which was marked on the official plat of the survey and as shown by the field notes of Howe, and the inner meander line representing the lake as it actually existed in 1876, when the field notes were made and filed, and as it now exists. A portion of the land lying between these lines is the land involved in this action, being land lying between the lake and the lots 3, 5, 6, and 7, in section 4, of the township mentioned.\n The dotted lines on the plat show the courses which would have to be followed in order to permit each of the lots above named to reach the lake as it actually exists. \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n'9. Since the spring of 1892, the defendants have been in actual and continuous occupancy of a portion of the land lying between the meander line described and returned by said Howe in his said purported field notes, and as located upon the government plat of said township, and the actual water line of said lake. Said occupancy has been under the claim that the lands occupied by said defendants were and are unsurveyed government lands, subject to homestead entry, and that they have not been patented by the government. The defendants have made valuable and lasting improvements upon the lands occupied by them respectively.\n\n'10. According to the plat of said township, the land in section 4 was divided into eight fractional government lots, lots 1, 2, and 8 comprising all of the land in the east half of said section, containing an aggregate of 122.3 acres, and lots 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 containing an aggregate of 182.08 acres, comprising all of the land in the west half of said section.\n\n'11. Between December, 1879, and March, 1887, all of said government lots [and all the surveyed lands within said township] were patented and conveyed by the United States, pursuant to the laws relating to the disposal of public lands, and by patents containing the usual clause, 'according to the official plat of the survey of said lands returned to the General Land Office by the surveyor general.' By divers mesne conveyances from said patentees, the title to said lots 3, 5, 6 and 7, containing, according to said plat and to the patents of said lands, the following quantities of land, respectively: Lot 3, 50.37 acres; lot 5, 34. 75 acres; lot 6, 30.5 acres; and lot 7, 25.25 acres, became vested in the plaintiff in the year 1891 and prior to the commencement of the actions; and the plaintiff is still the owner thereof, and, as such owner, has within the boundary of said lots, as shown upon said plat, and within the meander line of said lake described in said field notes, the full quantity of land above described as contained therein.\n\n ... * *\n'If the side lines of said lot 3 were produced and extended \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n in straight lines southerly from its southern boundary, as shown upon the government plat, and as herein found and determined, and the said lot was so extended to the southerly boundary of said section 4, then in that event the said lot would not touch said Ely lake, nor would there be any lake frontage thereon, and said lot would then contain 160 acres of land; neither would said lines nor said lot reach said lake, no matter how far extended.\n\n'If the side lines of said lot 5 were produced and extended easterly from the eastern boundary of said lot, as shown upon the government plat, and as herein found and determined, to the eastern boundary of said section 4, the northern line of said lot following the old meander line of said lake, and the southern line of said lot being produced and extended in a straight line, and said lot was so extended, then in that event the said lot would not touch said Ely lake, nor would there be any lake frontage thereon, and said lot would contain about 112 acres of land.\n\n'If the side lines of lot 6 were produced and extended in straight lines easterly from the eastern boundary of said lot, as shown upon the government plat and as herein found and determined, to the eastern boundary of section 4, and said lot was so extended, then in that event the said lot would not touch said Ely lake, nor would there be any lake frontage thereon, and said lot would then contain 160 acres of land.\n\n'If the side lines of said lot 7 were produced and extended in straight lines easterly from its eastern boundary, as shown upon the government plat and as herein found and determined, to the eastern boundary of said section 4, and the said lot was so extended, in that event the south line of said lot would touch said Ely lake, and a few feet of lake frontage would then be contained in said lot, and said lot would contain about 139 acres of land.\n\n'I further find that it would be impossible to extend said lots within their respective side lines, as above specified, without \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n instant and irreconcilable interference with each other, and that no one of said lots has any prior or superior right over any of the others to be so extended.'\n\n Messrs.

Wilson for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The land in controversy in this case is described in the foregoing statement of facts, and it lies between the meander line as it appears on the plat of the survey referred to in the patents and the actual borders of the lake. See the sketch of the plat at page 43 of volume 189, United States Reports, 47 L. ed. 702, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602. Regarding the question of the boundaries, counsel for plaintiff in error assert in their brief that if distance is to prevail, then the land in controversy is an unsurveyed strip lying between the lots of the plaintiff in error and the lake; while if the natural monument is to prevail, then the strip of land in controversy is part and parcel of the lots of the plaintiff in error. The boundaries of the lots as shown upon the plat of survey giving the so- called meander line of the lake, described in the field notes, are unquestionably correct, so far as the three sides of the fractional lots are concerned, and the only difference is as to the side which purports to front on the lake. In regard to this fourth side, the plaintiff in error, as a remote grantee from the patentees, bases its claim to the land lying between the \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 179]\n\u00a0\n meander line and the lake, upon the grounds that the patents conveying the lots to the patentees contained the clause: 'According to the official plat of the survey of the said lands returned to the General Land Office by the surveyor general;' that the plat of the survey of the lands, by reason of such reference, became a part of the grant described in the patents; that the plat showed, as the fourth side of the land granted, a meander line around Cedar Island lake; that the lake thereby became a natural monument or boundary, and that although the plat of the survey turns out to have been a mistake as to the position of the lake, and the line was, therefore, not in truth anything like an accurate meander line, yet, by reason of that plat and of that line, which assumed to show the borders of a lake, the patentees had the right to claim that they bought in reliance upon, and that they were entitled to, a boundary upon a lake.\n In support of these contentions the plaintiff in error cited Cragin v. Powell, \n128 U.S. 691\n, 32 L. ed. 566, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203, and Jefferis v. East Omaha Land Co. \n134 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, 33 S. L. ed. 872, 878, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518, as to the effect of a grant according to an official plat of a survey referred to in the grant, and to the cases of M'Iver v. Walker ( 1815) 9 Cranch, 173, 3 L. ed. 694; Newsom v. Pryor (1822) 7 Wheat. 7, 5 L. ed. 382; St. Clair County v. Lovingston (1874) 23 Wall. 46, 23 L. ed. 59; Bartlett Land & Lumber Co. v. Saunders (1880) \n103 U.S. 316\n, 26 L. ed. 546, and other cases, affirming the general rule that, in matters of boundaries, natural monuments of objects will control courses and distances.\n These general rules may be admitted. The rule as to natural monuments is not, however, absolute and inexorable. It is founded upon the presumed intention of the parties, to be gathered from the language contained in the grant, and upon the assumption that the description by monuments approaches accuracy within some reasonable distance, and places the monument somewhere near where it really exists. White v. Luning, \n93 U.S. 514\n, 23 L. ed. 938; Ainsa v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 208, 229\n, 40 S. L. ed. 673, 680, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544; Baldwin v. Brown, 16 N. Y. 359; Buffalo, N. Y. & E. R. Co. v. Stigeler, 61 N. Y. 348; Higinbotham v. Stoddard, 72 N. Y. 94; \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 180]\n\u00a0\n Hall v. Eaton, 139 Mass. 217, 29 N. E. 660. These cases illustrate somewhat the principle upon which the general rule is founded, and show how far it has, upon occasion, been regarde as inapplicable. The patents mention the number of acres contained in each lot, and that number is stated in the 11th finding of the trial judge, which is set forth in the foregoing statement of facts. The difference between the number of acres stated in the patents to be in each lot and the number now claimed by the plaintiff in error is very large, and is subsequently referred to herein. It seems plain that the intention was to convey no more than the number of acres actually surveyed and mentioned in the patents. In Ainsa's Case, \n161 U.S. 208\n, 40 L. ed. 673, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544, this is deemed to be a very important, and sometimes a decisive, fact. It is true that many cases cited by the plaintiff in error have enforced the superiority of natural monuments over courses and distances where the difference in the amount of the land conveyed as between the two classes of description was also very great. In the case at bar, while there is a great difference in the amount of land so described, there are, at the same time, other facts which are material and which, in our opinion, when considered in connection with this difference, justify and demand a refusal to be controlled by the borders of the lake as a boundary.\n It is well to see what the facts in this case were upon which the state court founded its decision. They are set forth in detail in the foregoing statement of facts, but a few of the more important may be here referred to.\n There was, in truth, no such survey as was called for by the contract between the government and the surveyor. The exterior lines, with the exception of the south line of the township, were run, but no survey of the interior of the township was ever made and no section lines thereof were ever run, with one possible exception, and in truth the survey as a whole was a fraud. No such body of water at the place indicated on the plat of survey then existed or now exists. On the contrary, the lake is from half a mile to a mile away from what is called \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 181]\n\u00a0\n its meander line on the plat of the survey filed by the surveyor. It covers only about 20 acres in the southeast corner section 4. The surveyor never was on the ground and never saw the lake he pretended to measure, and the lake never existed where he laid it down in his fraudulent survey. If the side lines of the various lots were protracted in their course, those of lot 3 would never reach the lake, and those of lots 5 and 6 would not reach the lake within the limits of section 4, while the south line of lot 7 would touch the lake, and a few feet of frontage would then be secured, and that lot would then have 139 instead of 25.25 acres. The side lines of lots 5, 6, and 7, if protracted, would instantly cross the protracted side lines of lot 3. There are at least 1,000 acres of high, tillable land between the actual water line of the lake and the meander line as returned by the field notes and the plat of survey, and the land is covered by trees of more than a century's growth and growing down to the water's edge. In order to bound on the lake the lots would exhibit a totally different form from that which they take on the plat of survey and such boundary would violate every rule of statutory survey, by conveying lands not conforming to the system adopted by the government, and carried out ever since its adoption.\n The patentees, it must also be borne in mind, get all the land they really purchased and paid for, as laid down by the lines and distances set forth in the survey and as stated in the patents. These lines and distances (of lots 3, 5 , 6, and 7) gave the patentees 140.87 acres of land, and that was the amount they paid for, while if the fourth line of the boundary of the lots were taken out and others substituted in the way shown by the dotted lines in the plat in \n189 U.S. 43\n, 47 L. ed. 702, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602, and so as to reach the borders of the lake as it then actually existed and now exists, they would get 571 acres, or fourfold more land than was actually mentioned and described in the patents conveying these four lots, or than they supposed they were purchasing, or than they actually paid for.\n Upon these facts the question recurs whether the patentees, \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 182]\n\u00a0\n by reason of the general rules above mentioned, took these lands which they now claim, although they never in reality bought or paid for them. We think they did not; that the rules have no application to a case like this, and that plaintiff in error must be confined to the lots which are correctly described within the lines and distances of the plat of survey and of the field notes and which the patentees actually bought and paid for.\n The fraudulent character of the survey, the nonexistence of the lake within at least half a mile of the point indicated on the plat, the excessive amount of land claimed as compared with that which was described and stated in the patents and actually purchased and paid for, the difficulty in reaching the lake at all, and the necessity, in order to do it, of going outside of section 4 (with the exception as to a small part of lot 7), the section in which the description and plat placed all the land, all go to show that the lake ought not to be regarded as a natural monument within the cases, or within the principle upon which the rule is founded, and therefore the courses and distances by which the amount of land actually purchased and paid for was determined, ought to prevail.\n The nonexistence of a lake anywhere near the spot indicated on the plat is a strong reason for regarding the so-called meander line as one of boundary instead of a true meander line, and when the plat itself is the result of a gross fraud, and indeed is entirely founded upon it, the reason for refusing to recognize the lake as a boundary becomes apparent.\n The land actually purchased and paid for was conveyed and covered by the description by courses and distances set forth in the field notes and referred to in the patents, and the government is concluded as to such land; but the implication of a boundary by the lake as delineated on the plat of survey, which might otherwise be made, will not be permitted when it is based upon such facts as have been already adverted to in this case. Giving the patentees all the land in acres, stated in the patents and described and contained in lines and distances \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 183]\n\u00a0\n in such patents, and which is all they paid for, protects them, and the government ought not to be further concluded by the fraudulent acts of a public officer.\n As is said in the trial court in this case, there must be some limit to the length courts will go in search of the water delineated on a plat of survey, with a meander line shown thereon. If the water were 10 miles away, it is certain that a claim to be bounded thereon would not for one moment be admitted. A distance of half a mile, enough to plainly show the gross error of the survey, together with the other facts adverted to herein, are sufficient to justify a refusal to apply the general rule that meander line is not usually one of boundary.\n Nor in such case is it necessary to go into equity to reform the patent. Where the patentee has in fact received, and is in possession of, all the land actually described in the lines and distances, and is seeking for more on the theory that his plat of survey carries him to the water, a denial of that claim upon such facts as appear here is well founded, and requires no reformation of the patent. It is simply a question of boundary, and it is a legal defense; it is but a denial that the land claimed is in fact included in the patent as it exists, and no aid of a court of equity is necessary to sustain such a defense.\n We think the French-Glenn Live Stock Co. v. Springer, \n185 U.S. 47\n, 46 L. ed. 800, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563, is authority which calls for the affirmance of this judgment. In that case the plaintiff claimed under patents from the United States, which referred to the official plats of the survey, and by which it appeared the township was rendered fractional by abutting upon the meander line along the south side of Malheur lake, which plat appeared to have been approved by the Land Department of the government, and the plat showed the lots as bounded 'north by the meander line of Malheur lake.' The field notes of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the township and its subdivisions and the meander line of Malheur lake itself, under the title heading 'Meanderings of the south shore of Malheur lake through fractional township 26,' etc., indicated that it was run 'with \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 184]\n\u00a0\n the meander of the lake.' The plaintiff in that case claimed title to land which was just north of this meander line on the ground that such land was a portion of the lake when the survey was made and the meander line run around it; that the water had since receded because of certain facts stated, and that plaintiff was entitled to the land thus uncovered, as an accretion by way of reliction to his adjoining land. The defendant disputed this claim, and asserted that when the survey was made and the plat thereof, with its meander line, was referred to in the patent, there was in fact no such lake anywhere near that spot, and the so-called meander line was in truth a line bounding plaintiff's land and limiting him thereby so that he could not go beyond it in order to find the lake which plaintiff claimed as a boundary. This court held that the line, which appeared on the plat as a meander line of the lake, was in truth a line of boundary beyond which the plaintiff could not go in search for the lake. The question of fact as to which of the two contentions was right, the receding of the water or the nonexistence of the lake at the time of the survey, was submitted to the jury, and that body found in favor of the defendant's theory. The result of the decision was to refuse to consider the lake as a natural monument, because it did not exist at any point near where it was placed on the plat. What purported on the plat to be a meander line was held not to be one, but on the contrary it was held to be a boundary of the land of the plaintiff, beyond which he could not go. After speaking of the question of fact and its decision by the jury in favor of the defendant, Mr. Justice Shiras, in giving the opinion of the court, said:\n'The land in dispute, in the possession of the defendant in error, was not included within the lines of the original survey, nor in the description of the lots contained in the patents and in the deeds of conveyance under which the plaintiff in error holds, and to add the land in controversy to the lots so described would more than double the area of the land claimed by the plaintiff in error; but the contention of the plaintiff in \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 185]\n\u00a0\n error was, in the courts below and now is, in this court, that, as the plaintiff in error bought in reliance upon the plats and patents which showed the meander line of the lake, such plats and patents must be deemed to conclusively establish that the lake was the northern boundary of the land, so far as the rights or riparian grantees are concerned. . . .\n\n'While it may be conceded that the description of the lots contained in the survey, plats, and patents is conclusive as against the government and holders of homesteads so far as the lands actually described and granted are concerned, such conclusive presumption cannot be held to extend to lands not included within the lines of the survey, and which are only claimed because of the alleged existence of a lake or body of water bounding said lots, whose recession has left bare land accruing to the owners of the abutting lots. We agree with the supreme court of Oregon in thinking that the question whether the northern boundary of the lots of the plaintiff in error was an existing lake, the recession of whose waters would leave the bed of the lake, thus laid bare, to accrue to the owner of the lots, was a question of fact which was not concluded by a mere call for a meander line. If, indeed, there had been a lake in front of these lots at the time of the survey, which lake had subsequently receded from the platted meander line, the claim of the owner of the lots to the increment thus occasioned might be conceded to be good, if such were the law of the state in which the lands were situated. But if there never was such a lake-no water forming an actual and visible boundary-on the north end of the lots, it would seem unreasonable, either to prolong the side lines of the survey indefinitely until a lake should be found, or to change the situs of the lots laterally in order to adapt it to a neighboring lake. The jury having found that the facts under this issue were as claimed by the defendant in error, the conclusion must be that the rights of the plaintiff in error must be regarded as existing within the actual lines and distances laid down in the survey and to the extent of the acreage called for in the patents, and \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 186]\n\u00a0\n that the meander line was intended to be the boundary line of the fractional section.'\n\n In the above cited case the important point to be considered is that the court refused to be bound by the appearance on the plat of survey showing a meander line of the lake when the fact was found by the jury ( and exists in this case) that at the time of the survey there was no such lake existing at any point near where it appeared to be on the plat, and that under those circumstances a meander line appearing on the plat would be and was regarded as a line of boundary to the exclusion of what was claimed to be a natural object, namely, the lake itself.\n It is not important that the plaintiff's claim was founded upon the allegation that the land there in question was the result of a subsidence of the water of the lake, and that he was, therefore, entitled to such land by reason of accretion. The point lies in the fact that what appeared as a meander line on the plat was treated as a boundary line and the lake was held not to be such boundary, for the resons stated in the opinion. Those reasons exist in full force in this case, only here the disparity between the amount of land conveyed and paid for and the amount now claimed is double that stated in the case cited. Mr. Justice Shiras, in the course of his opinion, refers to other cases in this court as authority for the proposition that a meander line may be in some cases a line of boundary limiting the land conveyed or described by the line itself, and not by any body of water. See Niles v. Cedar Point Club, \n175 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 44 S. L. ed. 171, 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 624; Horne v. Smith, \n159 U.S. 40\n, 40 L. ed. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 988. Upon this subject it was well said by the state supreme court in this case as follows:\n'The official plat was only intended to be a picture of the actual conditions on the ground; but the fraudulent mistake in the plat in this case was so gross that no man actually viewing the premises could possibly be misled or believe that the shore line of the lake was intended as the boundary line of the lots. He would understand at once that the meander line \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 187]\n\u00a0\n as traced on the plat was the actual boundary line of the lots. This case, then, is one where the call for the natural monument, the lake, must be disregarded, for the admitted facts show that it is an impossible call, and that if it is rejected the courses and distances and the meander line will exactly close and give to the plaintiff the precise quantity of land bought from the government and paid for. It falls within the rule that a meander line is not, as a general proposition, a boundary line, yet the boundaries of fractional lots will not be indefinitely extended where they appear by the government plat to abut on a body of water which in fact has never existed at substantially the place indicated on the plat. In such exceptional cases the supposed meander line will, if consistent with the other calls and distances indicated on the plat, mark the limits of the survey, and be held to be the boundary line of the land it delimits.'\n\n That this was a fraudulent survey cannot be denied. Still, the government is concluded by such survey, so far as the lands actually described, granted, and paid for are concerned, but it will not be concluded in regard to other lands, which were not within the lines of the survey, and which are only claimed because of the alleged existence of a lake or body of water bounding said lots, when such lake or body of water is in fact and always has been more than half a mile away from such lots, and where the patentee has received all the land that he actually paid for.\n It appears from the various reports of the case of Kirwan v. Murphy, cited by plaintiff in error, that the government was intending to make a survey of that portion of this township lying between the alleged meander line and the actual lake, as unsurveyed land, when certain grantees of patentees of lots, which by the plat of survey bounded on the lake, commenced proceedings to obtain an injunction to prevent what was alleged would be a resurvey. The case is first reported in 28 C. C. A. 348, 49 U. S. App. 658, 83 Fed. 275, where the opinion of the circuit court of appeals is given upon affirming the order granting the injunction. The case was then tried, and the decision of the United States circuit court in Minnesota, upon such trial, directing judgment for the plaintiffs, is reported in 103 Fed. 104, and upon appeal the decision of the United States circuit court of appeals \n\n[193 U.S. 167, 188]\n\u00a0\n for the eighth circuit, affirming the judgment, is reported in 48 C. C. A. 399, 109 Fed. 354. Those courts were of opinion that the Land Department had no right to make the proposed survey, and that the fractional lots went to the lake, and the government could not revoke its grant and correct the survey so far as regarded the patentees, or their grantees, in good faith. Upon writ of error from this court the judgment was reversed for the reason that the remedy by injunction was not proper, and also because the Land Department was vested with the administration of the public lands and could not be devested by the fraudulent action of a subordinate officer, outside of his authority, and in violation of the statute. The exact point involved here was not presented in that case, and this court held that it could not be passed upon in that proceeding. \n189 U.S. 35\n, 47 L. ed. 698, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 599.\n For the reasons we have stated, we cannot concur in the conclusions of the lower Federal courts, that the patentees had the right to bound their lots by the lake as it actually existed. The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSELDEN v. MONTAGUE(1904)\nNo. 190\nArgued: Decided: April 25, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. John S. Wise for appellants.\n Messrs.

The facts and conditions are substantially similar, and for the reasons there given the appeal will be dismissed without costs to either party. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAPPIRIO v. GOLDBERG(1904)\nNo. 87\nArgued: Decided: January 18, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was an action begun in the supreme court of the District of Columbia by Mary Shappirio and Jacob Shappirio, her husband, against Minnie D. Goldberg and George Goldberg, her husband, having for its object equitable relief because of alleged fraud of the respondents in the sale of certain property in Washington, District of Columbia, to the complainant, Mary Shappirio.\n It appears that the sale was made through one Richold, a broker in real estate. George Goldberg was the owner of the property, and by memorandum made on May 11, 1900, authorized Richold to sell the property known as lots Nos. 1245 and 1247, being part of lot 28, square 977, fronting 34 feet on 11th street S. E., by 80 feet deep to an alley. Richold sold the property to Jacob Shappirio, for whom he was seeking an investment, for the price of $6,000. The terms were cash, $100 having been paid down at the making of the sale. This \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n property, having two buildings upon it, and being part of lot 28, is described as follows:\n'Beginning for the same at the southeast corner of said lot and running thence north on Eleventh street thirty-four (34) feet; thence west eighty (80) feet eight (8) inches to an alley; thence south on said alley fourteen (14) feet; thence east eighteen (18) feet; thence south twenty ( 20) feet, and thence east sixty-two (62) feet eight (8) inches to the place of beginning.'\n\n In the rear of the premises there was a strip 20 by 30 feet, having upon it a shed or stable, which, before the sale, was in the possession of Goldberg under an arrangement for its use, and was used by him in connection with the premises. This piece was not fenced off at the time of sale, and might well be taken to be a part of the premises by any person examining the same without accurate knowledge of the extent of the property actually owned by Goldberg. The annexed plat shows the part of lot 28 covered by the description in the deed, and the part of lot 2 in dispute:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Although the purchase was made by Jacob Shappirio, the deed was made to Mary Shappirio, June 5, 1900. On September 28, 1900, a conveyance by the owner of the title to lot 2 was made of the part of that lot in the rear of the premises to Minnie D. Goldberg, wife of George Goldberg, for the consideration of $300. Mary Shappirio and Jacob Shappirio on \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n June 5, 1900, executed a deed of trust upon the property conveyed to her, in the sum of $4,500. In the trust deed the property was accurately described.\n After the property had been conveyed to Mary Shappirio it was rented to Goldberg, the vendor, who continued to occupy the same for eleven months. Upon asking a reduction of the rent, which was refused, Goldberg left the premises. On May 18, 1901, the present bill was filed, in which it was charged that Goldberg, in order to induce the sale in question, falsely represented that the property in the rear of lot 28 belonged to him, and would be included in the property sold, and notwithstanding the appearance of the property and the representations of Goldberg, the part conveyed did not include the part of lot 2 in the rear of lot 28; that George Goldberg afterwards purchased the property, part of lot 2, and caused the same to be conveyed to Minnie D. Goldberg, his wife, as a part of a scheme to defraud the plaintiff; that the wife was a party to the fraud, and had no interest in the property except to hold it for her husband.\n The bill prays that this parcel of ground, part of lot 2, be decreed to be held by Minnie D. Goldberg for the use of the plaintiff, Mary Shappirio, and be conveyed to her. If this relief cannot be granted, the prayer is that the sale be rescinded, and Goldberg be required to pay back the amount of the purchase money, with costs and charges, and, upon default of payment, the property be sold.\n A general denial of the allegations of fraud and deceit is made in the answer, together with the averment that the plaintiffs relied upon their own investigation, and if they were deceived as to the extent of the property, it was the result of the want of due care upon their part.\n In the supreme court the bill of the complainant was dismissed, which decree was affirmed in the court of appeals.\n Mr. Leo Simmons for appellants. \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas M. Fields for appellees.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 232, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question raised for our consideration involves the \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 240]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of this court on appeal, it being claimed that the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, does not exceed the sum of $5,000. By the act of February 9, 1893 (chap. 74, 27 Stat. at L. 434, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573), jurisdiction to review the final judgments of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia is given where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of $5,000, exclusive of costs. In determining this question we may look to the allegations and prayer of the bill to ascertain the relief sought and the real extent of the controversy between the parties. The bill contains a prayer for the conveyance of the small strip of ground, which was purchased for $300, and if that were the only subject-matter of the suit, the amount required to give this court the right of review would not be in controversy. But if this relief is denied, the complainant seeks, in the alternative, to have the contract rescinded and the payment of the sum of $6,000, the purchase money, with costs and interest, decreed against the respondent. Upon the pleadings we are of opinion that this sum is also in dispute between the parties, and therefore this court has jurisdiction. To ascertain the right of jurisdiction in such a case we look not to a single feature of the case, but to the entire controversy between the parties. Stinson v. Dousman, 20 How. 461, 15 L. ed. 966.\n In this case the issues are mainly those of fact, and, in the absence of clear showing of error, the findings of the two lower courts will be accepted as correct. Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 U.S. 1\n, 42 L. ed. 639, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274; Dravo v. Fabel, \n132 U.S. 487\n, 33 L. ed. 421, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 170. An examination of the record in the light of these findings does not enable us to reach the conclusion that error has been committed, to the prejudice of the appellants.\n As to what was said by Goldberg at the time of the purchase of the property, in conversation with Richold, the broker, and at the time the premises were visited by Shappirio with a view to purchase, there is much conflict of testimony. The use of the premises as a connected whole might well lead the purchaser to believe, in the absence of accurate knowledge, that it was all under the ownership of one person, and would be \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 241]\n\u00a0\n included in the sale of the property to him; and, as said by the court of appeals, we believe that Shappirio may have been ignorant of the true condition of the title. But it was also found by that court that a correct description of the property was given in the deed and recorded chain of title. Richold, who made the sale, was intrusted by Shappirio with the examination of the deed and title, and thirty days were given to complete the purchase. For this purpose Richold was the agent of Shappirio, and it not appearing in the proof that he was misled by the representations of Goldberg, or that by any scheme or plan he was kept from a full examination of the title and the description of the property contained in the deed furnished, he must be held chargeable with knowledge which the opportunity before him afforded to investigate the extent and nature of the property conveyed and which he undertook to examine for the purchaser. It is true that Richold testifies that he was misled by the silence of Goldberg, and by the situation and use of the property, and stoutly denies that he had the knowledge which a reading of the accurate description of the deed would give. But he undertook to investigate the matter and report upon the title. A casual reading of the description in the deed or examination of the recorded plat would have shown that the premises were not of a uniform depth of 80 feet, and had the Lshape extension in the rear of the lot, which excludes any part of lot 2 from the premises conveyed. For the purpose of this examination Richold was the agent of Shappirio, and his knowledge and means of information must be imputed to the purchaser. There are cases where misrepresentations are made which deceive the purchaser, in which it is no defense to say that had the plaintiff declined to believe the representations, and investigated for himself, he would not have been deceived. Mead v. Bunn, 32 N. Y. 275. But such cases are to be distinguished from the one under consideration. When the means of knowledge are open and at hand, or furnished to the purchaser or his agent, and no effort is made to prevent the party from using them, and especially where the \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 242]\n\u00a0\n purchaser undertakes examination for himself, he will not be heard to say that he has been deceived to his injury to the misrepresentations of the vendor. Slaughter v. Gerson, 13 Wall. 379, 20 L. ed. 627; Southern Development Co. v. Silva, \n125 U.S. 247\n, 31 L. ed. 678, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 881; Farrar v. Churchill, \n135 U.S. 609\n, 34 L. ed. 246, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 771; Farnsworth v. Duffner, \n142 U.S. 43\n, 35 L. ed. 931, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164.\n If this action is viewed as one to rescind a contract, in the light of the testimony and the findings of the courts below, the appellant stands upon no better ground.\n It is well settled by repeated decisions of this court that where a party desires to rescind upon the ground of misrepresentation or fraud, he must, upon the discovery of the fraud, announce his purpose and adhere to it. If he continues to treat the property as his own the right of rescission is gone, and the party will be held bound by the contract. Grymes v. Sanders, \n93 U.S. 55\n, 23 L. ed. 798; McLean v. Clapp, \n141 U.S. 429\n, 35 L. ed. 804, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 29. In other words, when a party discovers that he has been deceived in a transaction of this character he may resort to an action at law to recover damages, or he may have the transaction set aside in which he has been wronged by the rescission of the contract. If he choose the latter remedy, he must act promptly, 'announce his purpose and adhere to it,' and not by acts of ownership continue to assert right and title over the property as though it belonged to him. In the present case, some months before the beginning of this action, probably in October, 1900, Shappirio learned that the conveyance did not include the premises, part of lot 2, in the rear of lot 28. It may be that the mere lapse of time in this case would not of itself have defeated the right to rescind, as a purchaser has a reasonable time in which to make election of such remedy after discovery of the fraud ( Neblett v. Macfarland, \n92 U.S. 101\n-105, 23 L. ed. 471, 472), but he cannot, after such discovery, treat the property as his own and exercise acts of ownership over it which show an election to regard the same as still his, and at the same time preserve his right to rescission. In the present case, after discovering that the part of lot 2 had not been conveyed by the \n\n[192 U.S. 232, 243]\n\u00a0\n deed, Shappirio collected rents for some months upon the property, corresponded with Goldberg as to future terms of rental, declined to reduce the rent, made some repairs upon the property, and performed other acts of ownership. This conduct is wholly inconsistent with an election to undo the transaction and stand upon his right to rescind the contract.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the decree of the Supreme Court, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAW v. CITY OF COVINGTON(1904)\nNo. 246\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Miller Outcalt, Alfred. C. Cassatt, and Richard P. Ernst for appellants. \n\n[194 U.S. 593, 594]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. J. Hanlon for appellees.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 593, 596]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit in equity brought by the appellants to enjoin the city of Covington from setting up an electric plant to furnish light, heat, and power to the city and its citizens. The ground of the suit is that the intended action of the city will impair the obligations of a contract with the Suburban Electric Company, contrary to article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff Shaw is trustee in bankruptcy of the Electric Company. The contract set up consists of a clause in a charter granted by the legislature of Kentucky on April 22, 1882, to the Covington Electric Light Company. By  5 the business of the company is limited to furnishing the city of Covington, its inhabitants, and others near the city, whth light, motive power, and heat, and the company is given the 'exclusive privilege of conducting the business above described within and adjacent to said city for the term of twenty-five years; but a nonuser of the privilege of this act of incorporation for five years shall work a forfeiture.' One of the contentions of the defendant is that this privilege was lost by nonuser. But as our judgment proceeds upon other grounds we say nothing about that, but assume, for the purposes of decision, that the privilege was acquired subject to the general reservation by the state of the power to repeal. peal. Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Citizens' Sav. Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 636\n, 43 L. ed. 840, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571.\n The circuit court dismissed the bill on the grounds that this privilege was repealed from and after September 28, 1897, by what is now  573 of the Kentucky statutes (1894), or would have been repealed if not previously lost by the consolidation of the Covington Electric Light Company with other companies on April 11, 1894, as the court thought that it had been. The plaintiffs appealed to this court. They are met at the outset by the dilemma that either the action of the municipality is sanctioned by the state, in which case the state must \n\n[194 U.S. 593, 597]\n\u00a0\n be taken to have exercised its reserved right to repeal its grant to that extent, or the action of the municipality is not so sanctioned; in which case it cannot be a law impairing the obligations of contracts within the clause of the Constitution, and the plaintiffs are out of court. Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 385, ante, p. 107, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107. See Joplin v. Southwest Missouri Light Co. \n191 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 156 S., ante, p. 43, 44, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43. But in view of City R. Co. v. Citizens' Street R. Co. \n166 U.S. 557\n, 41 L. ed 1114, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653, we do not stop to consider this point further, as the result will be the same, whatever the ground.\n As we have implied, the original grantee of the exclusive privilege consolidated with other companies on April 11, 1894. This was done under what are now  555 and 556 of the Kentucky statutes. By the latter section, when the agreement of consolidation is recorded, etc., 'the separate existence of the constituent corporations shall cease, and the consolidated corporations shall become a single corporation, in accordance with the said agreement, and subject to all the provisions of this chapter, and other laws relating to it, and shall be vested with all the property, business, credits, assets, and effects of the constituent corporations, without deed or transfer, and shall be bound for all their contracts and liabilities.' The old companies disappear and the new company must claim whatever rights it gets from the law which calls it into being. It is absolutely subject to the Constitution and laws then in force. Therefore it can claim the franchises and privileges of its constituent companies by succession, only under the words 'property,' or 'assets and effects,' if at all. These words certainly are not happily chosen to express the transfer of a franchise, still less to express the continuance of a right not to be competed with, granted by the legislature to a named corporation, after that corporation shall have ceased to exist. The natural meaning of the words would be that the ordinary property of the consolidating corporations, the property such as any one might own without \n\n[194 U.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n special franchise, and might transfer by deed, shall belong to the new company without deed, but the franchises of the new company would seem to be left to be determined by the general law. The new corporation is to be 'subject to all the provisions of this chapter, and other laws relating to it.' This interpretation is strengthened by the consideration that other sections show that the legislature had franchises and privileges before its mind, and evidently did not fail to mention them from forgetfulness. In the cases cited by the appellants the privileges and franchises of the constituent companies were continued in the new company by explicit and careful words. Philadelphia & W. R. Co. v. Maryland, 10 How. 376, 13 L. ed. 461; New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Louisiana Light & H. P. & Mfg. Co. \n115 U.S. 650\n, 29 L. ed. 516, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252.\n The impression that the plaintiffs did not inherit a right to exclude the city of Covington from setting up a plant before 1907 as the result of the consolidation is confirmed still further when we consider the state of the law at the time. By  191 of the Constitution of 1891 'all existing charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which a bona fide organization shall not have taken place, . . . shall thereafter be void and of no effect.' Again, by  164, no city can grant any franchise or privilege, or make any contract in reference thereto, for a term exceeding twenty years, and the grantee is to be the highest and best bidder at public offer. We assume that the Covington Electric Light Compny escaped these sections, but they show the policy of the state to have been against such a right as it claimed. It is doubtful, at least, whether the legislature could have granted it in 1894; and this is a reason the more for construing the strict language of the consolidation sections to have meant no more than they said. We may add to the foregoing, as indicative of the general jealousy of exclusive rights,  3 of the Bill of Rights: 'No grant of exclusive . . . privileges shall be made to any man or set of men except in consideration of public services.' It was uncertain, until decided, whether, \n\n[194 U.S. 593, 599]\n\u00a0\n under this section, such an exclusive clusive right as that of the Covington Electric Light Company could be granted, and the prevailing local opinion was that such grants were forbidden. Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens' Gaslight Co. \n115 U.S. 683\n, 29 L. ed. 683, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265; S. C. 81 Ky. 263. This, again, goes to show that the meagre words used in describing the rights of the new company were chosen with intelligent care. Everything in the Constitution looked to the abolition and refusal of special privileges, and to putting all corporations on an equal footing. It was natural, therefore, when old corporations consolidated, that the law should treat the new corporation which it then called into being as it would have treated another corporation coming into being at the same time, but starting fresh, instead of being a consolidation of the old. We refer again to the words, 'subject to all the provisions of this chapter, and other laws relating to it,' in  556.\n Finally, we add to the language of the Constitution the section of the statutes which the circuit court adjudged to have repealed the grant of a monopoly to the original company. By  573 the provisions of all charters 'which are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter concerning similar corporations, to the extent of such conflict, and all powers, privileges, or immunities of any such corporation which could not be obtained under the provisions of this chapter, shall stand repealed on September 28, 1897,' and the exercise of the repealed powers is made a crime. After September 28, 1897, the provisions of the chapter are to apply to all corporations if they would be applicable to such corporations if organized under that chapter. There was nice discussion, and it is a fair question whether this section did not repeal the exclusive privilege given to the Covington company in 1897, if that privilege survived the consolidation. But we refer to it only as an aid in construing  556. It is another evidence of the wish and intent of the legislature to bring all corporations to a level when it could.\n Practically it was admitted that the new corporation formed \n\n[194 U.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n by consolidation in 1894 was subject to the statutes and Constitution then in force. Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 395, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240. To dispute the proposition would be to discredit the whole of the appellant's case. But that being so, we think that we have shown that the policy of the law at the time of the passage of the consolidation statute (Dy. Stats.  556, act of April 5, 1893) was entirely opposed to the continuance of such a special right as is claimed, and therefore have given a sufficient reason for construing the words as meaning what they seem on their face to mean, and no more. It may be doubted whether the legislature could have kept the Covington Light Company monopoly alive in the hands of a new and distinct corporation. Keokuk & W. R. Co. v. Missouri, \n152 U.S. 301\n, 38 L. ed. 450, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592. But, at all events, we are satisfied that it did not try to do so. See Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 395, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240.\n In the very able argument for the appellant an attempt was made to detach the exclusive privilege, given by  of the Covington Electric Light Company's charter, from 'conducting the business,' to which it was attached by that section, and to transfer it to the 'privilege,' granted by  6, 'subject to the regulations of the city authorities, to lay its pipes and mains, to erect its poles, posts, and wires through and along any street,' etc. The latter, it is said, is an easement, the exclusive character is part of it, and it all goes, like any other property, to the successors of the Covington Company. We cannot be so ingenious. However the plaintiffs may stand as to using the streets, the Covington Company's monopoly in business was distinct from its rights in the streets. When the Covington Company died its monopoly came to an end.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White dissented. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHEPARD v. BARRON(1904)\nNo. 217\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This bill was filed in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Ohio, against the defendant, as the treasurer of the county of Franklin, in the state of Ohio, to enjoin him from taking any proceedings towards the collection of the balance of an assessment for a local improvement upon land belonging to the appellants near the city of Columbus, in the state of Ohio, because, among other grounds alleged in the bill, the assessment to pay for the improvement as provided for in the act was to be made by the foot front, and not in proportion to the special benefit which might result from the improvement to the property assessed, and on this ground it \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 554]\n\u00a0\n was averred that the act violated the 5th Amendment, and also  1 of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The bill was dismissed by the circuit court, and from the judgment of dismissal the plaintiffs have appealed directly to this court, because the law of Ohio referred to in the bill is claimed to be in contravention of the Federal Constitution. Act of 1891,  5 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517], U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.\n The original plaintiffs were partners doing business under the name of the Alum Creek Ice Company, and as such were the owners of the land described in the bill, and soon after the commencement of this suit one of the plaintiffs sold out his interest in the property, including the land, and his grantees were substituted as plaintiffs in his stead, and assumed his liabilities with regard to the land. Hereinafter they will all be described as the plaintiffs, as if they had all originally been parties to the suit, and had signed the papers and made the representations hereinafter mentioned.\n The answer denied the averments of the bill, and also set up facts which, as defendant insisted, precluded the plaintiffs from obtaining relief by injunction, as prayed for in the bill.\n Upon the trial it appeared that the plaintiffs and others were separate owners of distinct portions of a tract of land adjoining the city of Columbus, Ohio, and bounded by the Columbus and Granville turnpike road, which was a public highway leading to and from the city of Columbus. The tract had a frontage on the road of 9,615.38 feet, of which the plaintiffs owned 1,111 feet. On March 26, 1890, an act was passed by the Ohio legislature (87 Ohio Laws, 113) which authorized the county commissioners in counties in which there were situate cities of the first grade of the second class to improve roads extending from such cities, and other roads and streets in certain cases. The act provided for an assessment by the foot front on the adjoining land in order to pay the cost of the improvement. Immediately upon the passage of the act, and on or about March 31, 1890, the owners of the tract, including the plaintiffs, who were owners of a part thereof, inaugurated proceedings \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 555]\n\u00a0\n under the act, and presented a petition to the county commissioners asking for the improvement of the road through their property, as provided for in the act. The petition has been lost, but the evidence shows it was signed in behalf of all the owners of the land (including the plaintiffs) fronting or abutting on that part of the road proposed to be improved. The persons who signed this petition and subsequently other papers, on behalf of plaintiffs, were duly authorized so to do. The petition was granted, and the commissioners made an order to that effect, and for the execution of the work at an expense of $7.25 per front foot. On or about August 1, 1890, a contract was entered into for the construction of the improvement, and between that time and October 16, 1891, the improvement was completed. An assessment was, on October 15, 1891, laid upon the whole tract to pay for the cost of the improvement, which amounted to $11.25 per front foot, thus largely exceeding the amount originally contemplated as such cost. This cost was thus enhanced by reason of changes of plans regarding the improvement, made from time to time as the work progressed, and which were assented to or asked for by the land owners, including the plaintiffs.\n In order to pay the cash for the cost of this improvement bonds were issued and sold by the county commissioners as provided for in the act, amounting to $110,000, in two issues, the first of $50,000 and the second of $60,000.\n The total amount of the assessment on the plaintiffs' land, assessed per front foot, as provided for in the act, was $12,812.61, which, as the plaintiffs insist, largely exceeded the special benefit arising from the improvement, and would result, if enforced to its full extent, in the confiscation of plaintiffs' property. The bonds not having been paid, an action was brought on them against the county commissioners in the Federal circuit court in Ohio, and judgment recovered by the bondholders, which was affirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals (55 C. C. A. 614, 119 Fed. 36). without, however, passing upon the validity of the assessment now before this \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n court (C. C. A. p. 626, Fed. p. 48). The act under which the improvement is made is set forth in full in the above report.\n After the plaintiffs had paid seven annual instalments of the assessment, each instalment amounting to $1,258.61, and the total being $8, 810.27, there remained a balance due on the assessment of $4,002.34, and this bill was filed on June 12, 1899, for the purpose of enjoining the collection of the balance remaining unpaid on the assessment, on the grounds already stated.\n Immediately after the contract for doing the work of improvement was entered into between the county commissioners and the contractor, and in compliance with the provisions of the act ( 13), the commissioners designated two of the owners of the abutting property, who, together with the county surveyor, were to constitute a board, which was authorized to elect a superintendent to see that the contract was performed in accordance to its true intent, and that all orders of the county surveyor in furtherance thereof were obeyed. Mr. Shepard, one of the plaintiffs, was designated as a member of the board, and acted as such, with another landowner and the county surveyor, and elected a superintendent, as provided for in the act.\n Mr. Shepard was also frequently present during the progress of the work, and knew of the alterations in the work as they were subsequently and from time to time made. He was familiar with the law under which the action of the county commissioners was invoked, and knew that it provided for an assessment upon the abutting property by te front foot for the payment of the cost of the improvement.\n During the progress of the work, and on June 29, 1891, the agent of the Columbus Land Association (one of the owners of a portion of the tract) made a written proposal to the commissioners in relation to the improvement in question, and agreed that the land association would secure and pay the entire expense in removing the earth upon the circle in East Broad street, and in beautifying and adorning the circle, upon \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n the condition that the street around the circle should be completed and paved in accordance with the plat, order, and contract mentioned. The plaintiffs, acting under the name of the Alum Creek Ice Company, together with the other owners of real estate abutting upon these improvements, addressed a written communication to the county commissioners in connection with the foregoing proposal of the land company, in which they spoke of the improvements 'now being made under proceedings by and before this board of county commissioners of Franklin county,' and in which they also said that they 'hereby withdraw all objection to said improvement and the assessment of their said real estate therefor on condition that the foregoing agreement shall be kept by said Columbus Land Association.' The offer of the company was accepted, and there is no claim made that the company did not fulfil the agreement.\n On September 2, 1891, the owners of the tract (plaintiffs among them) petitioned the commissioners to cancel the contract, with the assent of the contractor, for sodding the sides of the improved roadways, and gave as a reason therefor that a number of the property owners had informed the contractor that they would rather have grass seed sown thereon. The petitioners concluded: 'We therefore petition that you cancel the above mentioned contract, and that each one, for their respective frontage upon said street, will see to it that grass seed is sown upon said sideways of East Broad street this fall, and take upon them selves the care and charge of the same.' The contract was canceled, as asked for, with the consent of the contractor.\n There was also presented to the commissioners a communication signed by the owners of the land, including the plaintiffs, asking the commissioners to cause all bonds issued by them for the expense of the improvement to be made for a period of twenty years from the date thereof, 'and if you can extend the time to twenty years for the bonds already sold, the extension of the time at which they would mature would be \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n satisfactory to the undersigned; all of which we respectfully petition for.'\n There was also signed by the plaintiffs Shepard and McLeish, among others, as members of the board appointed under the act ( 13), a resolution, 'That the board for the improvement of said street hereby respectfully requests the county commissioners to do all in their power to carry out the prayer of said petition;' the petition being to the board of county commissioners to take steps to have the bonds for the improvement extended so as to run twenty years.\n There was also signed by all the landowners, including the plaintiffs, a communication, which, on account of its recitals and statement, is set forth at length:\n'Whereas, on the 31st day of March, 1890, a petition signed by the subscribers hereto was by us presented to the board of county commissioners of Franklin county, Ohio, praying for the improvement of the extension of East Broad street, in this county, beginning at the bridge across Alum creek on said street, and extending eastwardly therefrom to the Cassady road, which said portion of said street lies in Marion township, said county, which said improvement was in said petition prayed to be made under the provisions of an act of the general assembly of Ohio, entitled 'An Act to Authorize County Commissioners in Counties in Which There Are Situated Cities of the First Grade of the Second Class, to Improve Roads Extending from Such Cities, and Other Roads or Streets in Certain Cases. Passed March 26, 1890.' Which said petition stated with what material said street should be paved and what provisions should be made for sidewalks, gutters, and other passages for carrying off the water, and between what points said street was to be improved, and the kind of material of a permanent character said petitioners desired used in said improvement; and whereas said petition was signed by all the persons owning property abutting upon the portion of said street in said petition asked to be improved, said petition stating the number of feet between the termini of said improvement; \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n 'And whereas, such proceedings were had by said board of county commissioners on said petition and in accordance with said act of the general assembly that the prayer of said petition was granted and said improvement made in accordance with the prayer of said petition; and\n\n'Whereas said original petition as well as other papers relating to said improvement have been lost or mislaid:\n\n'Now, in consideration of said improvement, and in order that the bonds to be issued to pay for said improvement may not lie under suspicion, or remain unsold by reason of the absence or loss of said original papers,\n\n'We hereby agree that such petition hereinbefore recited was filed, signed by us as herein stated, and that we will not set up as a defense against any assessment upon our said property abutting upon said improvement for the payment of bonds issued on account thereof any informality arising from the absence or loss of any of said papers, but agree that said improvement was legally made and constructed.'\n\n This paper was signed before the bonds, spoken of therein, were issued by the commissioners. It was required by the proposed purchaser of the bonds before they were taken and paid for. After the paper was signed the county commissioners thereupon issued the bonds, and delivered them to the Ohio National Bank of Columbus, as agents for the purchasers.\n After the improvements were completed, the plaintiffs, in connection with other property owners, signed a petition to the county commissioners to lay sewer pipe (a 15 and a 24-inch pipe), and the petition provided: 'The expense of said work to be assessed against the respective property on the street, the same as other expenses for making said improvement are levied and paid.'\n This is claimed to be a recognition of the assessment after the improvement had been made, and after the landowners knew what it was, of their willingness to be still further assessed to effect a complete work.\n Another paper, containing somewhat more in detail the \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n alleged facts regarding the improvement, and ending with the statement, 'Said improvement has been, and is now being, legally made and constructed, and we hereby request that you execute and issue such further amount of bonds as shall be necessary to pay the cost of improvement,' and purporting to be signed by the plaintiffs, among others, was offered ( though it does not appear to have been received) in evidence. It was objected to by the plaintiffs on the ground that there was no proof that the paper had been signed by the plaintiffs, and that if the paper was a copy of another paper of similar import, the original was already in evidence. The record does not disclose what was the decision upon the objection thus made. The paper, it was stipulated between the parties, was a copy of the county commissioners' record of Franklin county, Ohio. A motion was also subsequently made to suppress this testimony, but no decision of the motion is disclosed by the record.\n During the making of the improvement, and for some time thereafter, all parties assumed the act of 1890, under which the improvement was made, was constitutional.\n The court below, upon all the evidence, held that it would consider but one matter of defense,-that of estoppel,-and held that it was sufficiently made out, and accordingly dismissed the bill.\nMr. David F. Pugh and Messrs. Pugh & Pugh for appellants.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Augustus T. Seymour and Henry A. Williams for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 553, 564]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n Both parties in this case seem to agree that the statute of 1890, under which these proceedings were taken, is void, as in violation of the state Constitution. As authority for that proposition the case of Hixson v. Burson, 54 Ohio St. 470, 43 N. E. 1000, is cited. The case holds that a statute of a nature similar to the one under consideration violated the provision of the Ohio Constitution, because, while its subject-matter was general, its operation and effect were local, thus violating the provisions of  26 of article 2 of the Constitution of that state, which provides that 'All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation throughout the state.' The act under consideration in the case at bar seems to come within the principle of the above case.\n The invalidity of the act as in violation of the state Constitution has also been recognized by the circuit court of appeals in the sixth circuit, in the case of Franklin County v. Gardiner Sav. Inst. 55 C. C. A. 614, 119 Fed. 36.\n The bonds were held in that case to be valid obligations of the county, notwithstanding the unconstitutionality of the act under which they were issued, because at the time of their issue, which was before the decision in Hixson v. Burson, and supreme court of Ohio had held in State ex rel. Hibbs v. Franklin County, 35 Ohio St. 459, that an act which was in all respects similar in its nature to the one under consideration was constitutional and valid, and the circuit court of appeals, therefore, held that under those circumstances the law as it had been declared at the time when the bonds were issued was the law applicable to them.\n But the plaintiffs also insist that the act is void as a violation of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Federal Constitution. The assessment per foot front, it is contended, leads in this case to a confiscation of the property of the plaintiffs, and is not based upon the fact of benefits received, and \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 565]\n\u00a0\n it results in taking the property of plaintiffs without due process of law.\n Before coming to the consideration of the validity of these objections to the statute, the defendant insists that by virtue of the facts already detailed in the foregoing statement the plaintiffs are not in a position to raise the question. We regard this objection as well taken.\n The facts upon which the defense rests are above set forth at length, not including the paper, which does not appear to have been received in evidence. A defense of this nature and upon these facts need not be placed entirely upon the strict and technical principles of an estoppel. While it partakes very strongly of that character, it also assumes the nature of a contract, implied from the facts, by which the party obtaining the benefit of the work agrees to pay for it in the manner provided in the statute under which it is done, even though the statute turn out to be unconstitutional. It does not in the least matter what we may call the defense, whether it be estoppel or implied contract, or one partaking of the nature of both, the result arrived at being that the plaintiffs are told that under all the facts proved in the case they cannot set up the unconstitutionality of the act, or that they are bound by their contract to pay the assessment. Where, as in this case, the work is done and the assessment made at the instance and request of the plaintiffs and the other owners, and pursuant to an act (in form, at least) of the legislature of the state, and in strict compliance with its provisions and with the petition of the landowners, there is an implied contract arising from such facts that the party at whose request and for whose benefit the work has been done will pay for it in the manner provided for by the act under which the work was done.\n In this case the manner of payment was, as provided for in the act, by an assessment upon the land by the foot front. The money thus collected would form a fund to be used to pay the bonds which were to be issued in accordance with the act by the county commissioners, acting for the county. The \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 566]\n\u00a0\n county thus became the debtor for a debt which was incurred entirely for the benefit, and at the request, of the owners of the land. Under such facts the county has the right to look at the assessment upon the land as the fund out of which to pay the bonds. In this view the constant and frequent promises and representations made by the plaintiffs after the work was embarked upon are material evidence of the implied contract to pay for the work, arising from the request for its performance. It is, therefore, upon these facts, immaterial that the law under which the proceedings were conducted was unconstitutional, because the work was done at the special request of the owners, under the provisions of the act, and upon a contract, both implied and in substance expressed, that the bonds would be paid, and the assessment to be imposed for the raising of a fund to pay them would be legal and proper.\n Although the landowners have been greatly disappointed in the results of the improvement, and the affair has proved somewhat disastrous, yet they have obtained just such an improvement as they asked for and expected, and they are the ones to bear the disappointment and loss.\n It is true this action is not between the bondholders and the owners of the land. The representations and agreement of the landowners were, however, made for the purpose of obtaining a market for the sale of the bonds, and, in order that there should not be any suspicion of their invalidity, the landowners agreed that the work was legally done, and the improvement legally constructed. The representation and agreement were, in fact, directed to all who might be interested in the matter, including the county commissioners, who were to issue the bonds as representatives of the county. The effect was to provide, in substance, that the lien of the assessment should be valid and the assessment should create a fund for the payment of the bonds. The defendant, representing the county, must be permitted to take advantage of the representations and agreement of the landowners, as the county has a direct interest in sustaining the validity of the assessment, and the representa- \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 567]\n\u00a0\n tions were made, among others, to the county commissioners, who represented the county in issuing the bonds and in doing the work.\n On principles of general law, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs are not in a position to assert the unconstitutionality of the act under which they petitioned that proceedings should be taken, and that the assessment should be made in accordance with those provisions. This principle has been recognized in Ohio many times. See also State ex rel. Columbus v. Mitchell, 31 Ohio St. 592, 609; Tone v. Columbus, 39 Ohio St. 281, 296, 48 Am. Rep. 438; Colunbus v. Sohl, 44 Ohio St. 479, 481, 8 N. E. 299; Columbus v. Slyh, 44 Ohio St. 484, 8 N. E. 302; Mott v. Hubbard, 59 Ohio St. 199, 211, 53 N. E. 47.\n In Wight v. Davidson, \n181 U.S. 371\n, 45 L. ed. 900, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, this court, while not positively deciding the proposition, yet strongly intimated (p. 377, L. ed. p. 904, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 618), that by reason of the acts of the appellees they were not in a position to question the validity of the statute there under consideration, but as there were others than the appellees concerned, and a decision of the court of appeals had declared the act void as to the appellees, it was thought better to pass by the question whether they were estopped by having made the dedication provided for in the act, and to decide the question of the constitutionality of the act of Congress under which the proceedings were had. The act was held to be valid.\n Under some circumstances a party who is illegally assessed may be held to have waived all right to a remedy by a course of conduct which renders it unjust and inequitable to others that he should be allowed to complain of the illegality. Such a case would exist if one should ask for and encourage the levy of the tax of which he subsequently complains; and some of the cases go so far in that direction as to hold that a mere failure to give notice of objections to one who, with the knowledge of the person taxed, as contractor or otherwise, is expending money in reliance upon payment from the taxes, may have the same effect. Cooley, Taxn. p. 573, and cases cited in note 5; Tash v. Adams, 10 Cush. 252; Bidwell v. Pittsburgh, 85 Pa. 412, 27 Am. Rep. 662; Shutte v. Thompson, 15 Wall. 151, 21 L. ed. 123. \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 568]\n\u00a0\n Provisions of a constitutional nature, intended for the protection of the property owner, may be waived by him, not only by an instrument in writing, upon a good consideration, signed by him, but also by a course of conduct which shows an intention to waive such provision, and where it would be unjust to others to permit it to be set up. Certainly when action of this nature has been induced at the request, and upon the instigation, of an individual, he ought not to be thereafter permitted, upon general principles of justice and equity, to claim that the action which he has himself instigated and asked for, and which has been taken upon the faith of his request, should be held invalid, and the expense thereof, which he ought to pay, transferred to a third person.\n Plaintiffs argue that, although the work was to be done under the provisions of the act of 1890, yet they had the right to assume that the assessment to be imposed for the payment of the bonds would be what they term a valid assessment; or, in other words, would be made as they insist, not upon the foot front (as provided for in the act), but according to the actual benefit received from the improvement; and they cite Birdseye v. Clyde, 61 Ohio St. 27, 55 N. E. 169, as authority for the proposition.\n In that case it was held that the landowner was not estopped to object to the assessment because he had acquiesced in the construction of the improvement and had petitioned therefor, and thereby consented to the raising of a certain proportion of its cost by an assessment on all abutting property. There was, however, a statute, which provided that no assessment should be made on any lot or land for an improvement in excess of 25 per cent of the value of the property as assessed for taxation. Although the plaintiff had petitioned for the improvement, it was held that he was not on that account estopped from objecting to any assessment which was over 25 per cent of the value of the property. It was not to be assumed that the plaintiff waived the benefit of the general statute because he asked for the work. The case has \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 569]\n\u00a0\n no application, as we think, to the one before us. Certainly, in the Birdseye Case, the plaintiff had a right to assume, notwithstanding his petition that the work should be done, that the assessment on his land should not be greater than the law provided for. But in the case at bar the petition asked for the doing of the work under the very statute which in terms provided that the assessment should be made by the foot front, exactly as in fact it was made, and in making such assessment the commissioners but complied with the request of the petitioners.\n The plaintiffs have referred to O'Brien v. Wheelock, \n184 U.S. 450\n, 46 L. ed. 636, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354, as the chief authority to support their contentions as to estoppel. In that case, while the estoppel contended for was denied, yet (at page 491, L. ed. p. 655, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 370), it is stated, in the opinion of the court, which was delivered by the Chief Justice, that: 'The result is not inconsistent with the cases that hold that, although a law is found to be unconstitutional, a party who has received the full benefit under it may be compelled to pay for that benefit according to the terms of the law. This is upon the theory of an implied contract, the terms of which may be sought in the invalid law, and which arises when the full consideration has been received by the party against whom the contract is sought to be enforced.'\n In the case at bar it is seen that the plaintiffs did, in fact, receive the full consideration for the contract. They obtained the improvement asked for, so far as the doing of the work was concerned, although the results arising therefrom were a great disappointment to them.\n Looking at the facts in the case cited, they show that the scheme proposed and under which the proceedings were taken was of large proportions, and consisted of a plan to redeem from overflow by the Mississippi river a large amount of land, from 3 to 5 miles in width, extending along the river for more than 50 miles, containing over 100,000 acres, lying in portions of three different counties, varying greatly in condition and value, and owned severally by a great \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 570]\n\u00a0\n number of people. The work was to be done by building levees and digging drains and ditches, and doing other work by which to drain the land and render it valuable for agricultural purposes. Certain of the landowners had at all times opposed the proceedings instituted to assess their land. The permanent success of the scheme rested in the character of the work and in its maintenance by compulsory process after it had been constructed in its various branches. The case is one seldom equalled in respect to the size of the tract to be reclaimed at the expense of the landowners, the numbers interested as such owners, and the immense expense of the work. The first requisite was a valid act of the legislature authorizing the work, and providing a means for its accomplishment. To that end the act of 1871 was passed. The history of the proceeding thereafter is given, commencing at page 457 of the report in 184 U. S., L. ed. p. 639, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 357, but it is entirely too long to be referred to here in detail. It is enough to say that, after perusing it, there will be found great difficulty in perceiving even a slight analogy to the case before us. The facts cannot be summarized. They must be appreciated in all their fullness and detail, and when thus examined the result arrived at will, as we think, seem inevitable. The case was sui generis.\n The one great purpose was not alone to build, but to maintain, a work which in its nature would require constant supervision and repair. Unless the work could be maintained by compulsion when necessary, it plainly would have appeared at the very beginning to involve an idle waste of money. It could not be maintained unless the act upon which the whole scheme rested was valid, and could from time to time and always be enforced. But that act was held to be unconstitutional long before the work was completed, and the landowners, on account of the inability to compel either the completion or the maintenance of the work, were unable to receive the benefit which it had been supposed would accrue under the act thus declared illegal. The work never was \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 571]\n\u00a0\n fully and in all things completed, while the credit of the bonds, which were issued to the contractors for doing the work, and sold by them, was maintained by reference simply to the law under which they were issued, and upon the opinion of counsel as to its validity.\n It also appears that the landowners never gave any assurance to the contractors for the work or to those who purchased the bonds after they were delivered to the contractors, regarding their validity or value, but they supposed if the work were done it could and would be kept up under the sanction of the law which provided for it.\n Upon the facts as detailed in the report, the court held that there was nothing in the general principles of implied contract which would prevent the landowners from resisting the enforcement of the lien of the bonds upon the land.\n In contrast with these facts it is seen that in the case at bar the plaintiffs and other landowners have received full consideration for their promise, and have obtained precisely what they asked for, and in the manner they asked it. We have also the written petition for the improvement, and active participation of the plaintiffs in carrying it out under the act, the frequent statements on their part and upon the part of the other landowners of the validity of the work, and the regularity of the assessment to be made under the terms of the act, and the specific statement, made for the purpose of inducing the issuing of the bonds and their purchase by the individuals who took them, that practically the work had been done properly, and there was no defense to the bonds. This is equivalent to saying the assessment to be laid as requested, under the act of 1890, would be valid, and no defense interposed to its collection. The differences of fact in the two cases show that the O'Brien Case furnishes no authority for the plaintiffs herein. We concur in the remarks of the District Judge in this case, when he said that: 'The complainants invoked the action of the county commissioners to enhance the value of their land; they actively promoted the improvement, knowing that its \n\n[194 U.S. 553, 572]\n\u00a0\n cost must be paid by a front foot assessment on thier property; they recognized the justice of the assessment from time to time during the progress of the work, and afterwards by paying annual instalments of the assessment for seven years, and until they were tempted by the decision of the Supreme Court, in Norwood v. Baker, \n172 U.S. 269\n, 43 L. ed. 443, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187, to cast their burden upon the general public; and it is now too late to complain of the method of the assessment or of the lack of the special benefits which were dissipated by the collapse of the 'boom.\"\n We do not consider the validity of the contention on the part of the plaintiffs, that the act, or the assessment in furtherance of its provisions, violates in any particular the Federal Constitution. For the reason given above we are of opinion the judgment is right, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSINCLAIR v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(1904)\nNo. 94\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. C. C. Cole and J. J. Darlington for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Andrew B. Duvall and Edward H. Thomas for defendant in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was prosecuted by information in the police court of the District of Columbia for a violation of an act of Congress, approved February 2, 1899, entitled 'An Act for the Prevention of Smoke in the District of Columbia, and for Other Purposes' (30 Stat. at L. 812, chap. 79), and was found and adjudged guilty, and sentenced 'to pay a fine of $50 and in default to be committed to the workhouse for the term of ninety days.' The judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, 20 App. D. C. 336, brought here on error, and argued on the merits and on motion to dismiss.\n The court of appeals of the District of Columbia was established by an act of Congress, approved February 9, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 434, chap. 74, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573),  8 of which was as follows:\n'That any final judgment or decree of the said court of appeals may be re-examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in all causes in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars, in the same manner and under the same regulations as heretofore provided for in cases of writs of error on judgment or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia; and also in cases, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in dispute, wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States.'\n\n On March 3, 1901, an act 'To Establish a Code of Law for the District of Columbia' (31 Stat at L. 1189, chap. 854), was approved (and subsequently amended by acts approved January 31 and June 30, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 2, chap. 5; 32 Stat. at L. 520, chap. 1329]),  233 of which provides that--\n'Any final judgment or decree of the court of appeals may \n\n[192 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n be re-examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in all cases on which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars, in the same manner and under the same regulations as existed in cases of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia on February ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and also in cases, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in dispute, wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States.'\n\n It will be perceived that  8 of the one act and  233 of the other are in substance the same, and they must bear the same construction. And the ruling in Chapman v. United States, \n164 U.S. 436\n, 41 L. ed. 504, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76, in respect of  8, is decisive to the point that this writ of error cannot be maintained.\n That case, as stated by the court, was this:\n'Chapman was indicted in the supreme court of the District of Columbia for an alleged violation of  102 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 55) in refusing to answer certain questions propounded to him by a special committee of the Senate of the United States, appointed to investigate charges in connection with proposed legislation then pending in the Senate. To this indictment the defendant demurred on the ground, among others, that  102 of the Revised Statutes was unconstitutional, and that, therefore, the court was without jurisdiction in the premises. This demurrer was overruled by the trial court, and its judgment thereon affirmed by the court of appeals of the District. 5 App. D. C. 122. Defendant was thereupon tried and convicted, and motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment having been made and overruled (the question of the constitutionality of  102 being raised throughout the proceedings), was sentenced to be imprisoned for one month in jail, and to pay a fine of $100 \n\n[192 U.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n which judgment was affirmed on appeal. 8 App. D. C. 302, 24 Wash. L. Rep. 251. A writ of error from this court was then allowed, 8 App. D. C. 320, 24 Wash. L. Rep. 297, which the United States moved to dismiss.'\n\n It was held that this court had no jurisdiction to review on writ of error a judgment of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia in a criminal case under  8 of the act of February 9, 1893; and the writ of error was accordingly dismissed. Attention was called to the fact that it had been previously decided that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a writ of error to review the judgments of the supreme court of the District of Columbia in criminal cases, either under the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517, 26 Stat. at L. 8261 (Re Heath, \n144 U.S. 92\n, 36 L. ed. 358, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 615); or under the act of Feb. 6, 1889, chap. 113, 25 Stat. at L. 6552 (Cross v. United States, \n145 U.S. 571\n, 36 L. ed. 821, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 842), or on habeas corpus (Cross v. Burke, \n146 U.S. 82\n, 36 L. ed. 896, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 22). And although the validity of any patent or copywright, or of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, was not drawn in question in those cases, it was distinctly ruled in reaching the conclusions announced that neither of the sections of the act of March 3, 1885 [23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572] applied to any criminal case; and Farnsworth v. Montana, \n129 U.S. 104\n, 32 L. ed. 616, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 253; United States v. Sanges, \n144 U.S. 310\n, 36 L. ed. 445, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, and United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 2 L. ed. 397, were cited with approval.\n We were of opinion that  8 of the act establishing the court of appeads of the District of Columbia, and the act of March 3, 1885 (chap. 355, 23 Stat. at L. 443, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 572), were the same in their meaning and legal effect. The 1st section of the act of 1885 prohibited appeals or writs of error unless the matter in dispute exceeded the sum of $5,000, but the 2d section provided that the restriction should not apply to cases wherein the validity of any patent or copyright was involved, or where the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, was drawn in question, and that in all such cases an appeal or writ of error might be brought without regard to the sum or value in dispute. And it was \n\n[192 U.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n ruled that the last clause of  8 of the act of 1893 must receive the same construction as had been given to the 2d section of the act of 1885. We said: 'The meaning of both statutes is that, in the cases enumerated, the limitation on the amount is removed, but both alike refer to cases where there is pecuniary matter in dispute, measurable by some sum or value, and they alike have no application to criminal cases.'\n United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 2 L. ed. 397, was cited to the main proposition, and was quoted from in respect of the suggestion that because the punishment on conviction by the statute under which plaintiff in error was indicted, tried, and convicted embraced a fine, there was, therefore, a sum of money in dispute. The case involved  8 of the act of February 27, 1801, chap. 15, entitled 'An Act Concerning the District of Columbia' (2 Stat. at L. 103), and creating a circuit court for the District of Columbia, which provided 'that any final judgment, order, or decree in said circuit court, wherein the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, by writ of error or appeal. . . .' It was held that this court had no jurisdiction under that section over the judgments of the circuit court of the District of Columbia in criminal cases, and Chief Justice Marshall said: 'On examining the act 'Concerning the District of Columbia,' the court is of opinion that the appellate jurisdiction granted by that act is confined to civil cases. The words, 'matter in dispute,' seem appropriated to civil cases, where the subject in contest has a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act. But, in criminal cases, the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused. And although he may be fined upwards of $100, yet that is, in the eye of the law, a punishment for the offense committed, and not the particular object of the suit.'\n And the previous ruling that  5 of the judiciary act of 1891 had no application was repeated. \n\n[192 U.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n Chapman's Case was decided November 30, 1896, and on the 3d of March, 1897, an act was approved which authorized this court to issue writs of certiorari in cases made final in that court, to bring them up for review and determination. 29 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 390, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 574. This was carried forward into  234 of the District Code, and in the meantime we had reviewed the judgment of the court of appeals in certain criminal cases on certiorari granted under the act. Winston v. United States, \n172 U.S. 303\n, 43 L. ed. 456, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 212, \n171 U.S. 690\n, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 887.\n The rule that applies to capital cases and infamous crimes applies to the criminal offenses over which the police court of the District of Columbia exercises jurisdiction, and under that rule this writ of error must be dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

CRAMER(1904)\nNo. 18\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This controversy relates to an alleged infringement by the petitioner, a New Jersey corporation, of United States letters patent No. 271,426, issued to the respondent on January 30, 1883, for 'a new and improved sewing-machine treadle.' For convenience the petitioner will be hereafter referred to as the Singer Company and the respondent as Cramer.\n The treadle device used by the Singer company on its sewing machines, which it was charged infringed the Cramer patent, was covered by letters patent No. 306,469, dated October 14, 1884, issued to the Singer company as the assignee of one Diehl.\n The file wrapper and contents exhibit the following proceedings in the Patent Office respecting the Cramer patent: The \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 266]\n\u00a0\n original application was filed on May 25, 1882, and was for the grant of letters patent to Cramer 'as the inventor for the invention set forth in the annexed specification.' The specification and oath thereto read as follows:\n'I, Herman Cramer, of the city of Sonora, in Tuolumne county, in the state of California, have invented certain improvements in a treadle, to be used in sewing machines, or other machinery where a noiseless treadle may be required, of which the following is a specification:\n\n'My invention consists of the usual platform marked 'A' in Fig. 1 of diagram on treadle bar. The ends of said treadle bar, marked 'B,' are shaped like the letter V, and rest in socket in lower end of a brace 'C,' the socket being \n\n shaped, the brace 'C' cast in one piece, and the treadle bar and platform on the bar is also cast in one piece.\n'The treadle bar rests in socket in brace 'C,' which is immediately above a cross brace usually in machines to keep them from spreading apart, the nut on end of cross brace is marked 'D.' Letter 'M' immediately beneath cross brace and treadle bar is an oil receiver to retain any drippings of oil from the bearings of treadle bar.\n\n'My invention consists in having the ends of the treadle bar V-shaped to fit in hole in brace 'C,' also \n\n shaped to receive the ends of the treadle bar.\n'This V-shaped treadle bar in brace 'C' entirely prevents noise from the treadle, is self-adjusting, and does away with the necessity of cones and set screws now in use. This I claim as my invention. Fig. 1 represents platform 'A' and treadle bar, the ends of which are V-shaped and marked 'B.'\n\n'Fig. 2 represents the lower end of brace 'C' with hole \n\n shaped to receive the ends of treadle bar 'B.'

The specification is written on both sides of the pages, while the rules direct that it should be written on one side of each page only.\n\n'No claim is appended to the specification. The oath is incomplete, as  39 of the rules requires applicants to state under the oath if the invention has been patented to them, or with their knowledge and consent to others in any foreign country, and, if so, the number, date, and place of such patent or patents. Reference is made to the patent to G. W. Gregory, No. 256,563, April 18, 1882, which exhibits the alleged invention.'\n\n On August 3, 1882, the following substitute specification, concluding with an oath similar to that appended to the prior specification, was sent to the Patent Office:\n'I, Herman Cramer, of the city of Sonora, in Tuolumne county, in the state of California, have invented certain improvements in a treadle and brace, to be used in sewing machines or other machinery where a noiseless treadle may be required, of which the following is a specification:\n\n'My invention consists in a combination of the usual platform marked 'A,' in Fig. 1 of diagram on treadle bar. The ends of said treadle bar marked 'B' are to bear against mufflers.\n\n'The treadle bar bearings are in and on brace 'C.' The treadle bar rests in socket in brace 'C,' which is immediately above a cross bar usually in machines to keep them from spreading apart. \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n 'The nut on end of cross bar is marked 'D.' Letter 'M,' immediately beneath cross bar, and treadle bar, is an oil receiver to retain any drippings of oil from the bearings of treadle bar.\n\n'The treadle bar, mufflers, and brace 'C' are held between the right and left legs of the machine by means of a brace bar underneath the treadle bar.\n\n'This brace and socket or bearing in or on brace is in one piece.\n\n'The treadle bar with mufflers on the ends, working or bearing in or on brace, entirely prevents noise from the treadle, is self-adjusting, and does away with the necessity for cones and set screws now in use.\n\n'Fig. 1 represents platform 'A' and treadle bar, the ends of which may be V-shaped, or any shape to suit, marked 'B.'\n\n'Fig. 2 represents the lower end of brace 'C.'\n\n\"D' represents nut on end of cross bar immediately below the treadle bar.\n\n'What I claim is a combination of brace 'C' with socket or bearing in it or on it, to receive the treadle bar with the mufflers at the ends of treadle bar or in or on brace 'C' in connection with said brace 'C,' and the treadle bar in connection with brace 'C,' and mufflers to work in or on brace 'C,' substantially as set forth.'\n\n On August 14, 1882, the examiner wrote Cramer, in care of his attorneys, as follows:\n'Applicant's amended claims are met by the patent to J. E. Donovan, June 28, 1881, No. 243,529, in view of which a patent is again refused.'\n\n Following this rejection there was filed a revocation of the power of attorney which had been executed by Cramer in favor of the attorneys who had theretofore conducted the proceedings, and an appointment of other attorneys for the further prosecution of the application. On October 17, 1882, the substituted attorneys sent to the Patent Office a new drawing and an amendment of the specification on file, which amendment consisted in canceling all the specification except the \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 269]\n\u00a0\n signature and substituting for the matter so stricken out the following:\n'Be it known that I, Herman Cramer, of Sonora, in the county of Tuolumne and state of California, have invented a new and improved sewing- machine treadle; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawing, forming part of this specification.\n\n'My invention relates to improvements in the bearings of sewing- machine treadles, and it has for its object to provide means, first, to keep the treadle bearings rigidly in line and at a fixed distance apart to avoid friction, and second, to make its movement in use noiseless. To this end my invention consists in the construction and combination of parts hereinafter fully described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings in which--\n\n'Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a portion of a sewing machine showing my invention.\n\n'Fig. 2 is a transverse vertical section through one bearing of the treadle.\n\n'A represents the treadle provided with the usual pitman connection by which to run the sewing-machine wheel. B represents the two trunnions cast as a portion of the treadle and extending from its sides into loopholes in the common cast-iron cross brace C. These trunnions are sharpened to an edge or corner along their lower sides, and the lower end of the loophole is hollowed to an angle more obtuse than the edge of the trunnion, to serve as a bearing for the same and permit the rocking motion common to treadles.\n\n'C represents the usual cast-iron double brace connecting the two end legs diagonally in a plane generally vertical. The lower ends of this brace are secured directly to the web of the legs by bolts d, and for convenience and strength I make the two ends of the common cross bar D serve as these bolts. The upper ends of the brace are secured as usual, either to the web of the legs or to the table of the machine near the legs. \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 270]\n\u00a0\n 'The treadle and its trunnion bearings are wholly independent of the cross bar D, except its service as stated, to hold the brace to the legs. The bearing holes in the brace are formed into long vertical loops to permit the entrance of the treadle.\n\n'Pieces of leather F, or other soft material, cover the top and end of each trunnion to serve as cushions to keep the same close in its bearing, to prevent the noise which would result were the trunnions permitted to bounce and thump endways, when the treadle is in motion. The leather F is fitted to the curve of the upper side of the trunnion, which is an arc of a cylinder, whose center of oscillation is the lower edge of the trunnion; the same leather also interposes between the end of the trunnion and the adjacent iron. f is a block serving as a mere backer to which the cushion F is attached. This block conforms to the back and top side of the cushion and fills the loophole in the brace above the trunnion. It also has tangs or projections e, resting in suitable recesses in the brace C, which are held between the brace and the web of the leg E, by which means the block and cushion are held in place. Below the bearings of the trunnions B, I provide cups, M, attached to the ends of brace C, to catch the oil that usually drips from such bearings.\n\n'By this construction my treadle bearings are rigidly fixed and in no way liable to get out of line or to require adjustment; the usual noise is prevented, and overflowing of oil is caught before it can do damage.\n\n'I am aware that sewing-machine treadles have before been provided with V-shaped bearings, and I do not claim the same as my invention; but--\n\n'What I claim and wish to secure by letters patent is--\n\n'1. The vertical double brace joining the legs of the two ends of a sewing machine, provided with holes through its lower extremities to serve as bearings, in combination with a treadle provided with trunnions fitted to oscillate in said bearings, substantially as specified. \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. The sewing-machine legs E, the vertical double brace C secured thereto and provided with holes to serve as bearings for the treadle A, and the treadle provided with trunnions B to oscillate in said bearings, in combination with the cushion F and the block f, as and for the purpose specified.'\n\n\n Accompanying the new specification was the following communication, signed by the attorney:\n'A new oath is herewith filed. Gregory, referred to, pivots the grooved trunnions of his treadle upon knife edges secured within the upper loops of two collars, which are secured to the cross bar by means of set screws to keep them from turning. Donovan pivots his treadle upon its trunnions having sharpened edges, in grooves in the cross bar, where it is held by collars provided with flanges projecting over the trunnions. Applicant pivots his treadle upon the sharpened edges of its trunnions in loop holes in the two ends of the brace which is bolted to the legs of the machine by the two edns of the cross bar. This service of the cross bar might be as well performed by two short bolts; but, the bar being a usual cross tie to stiffen the legs, applicant uses its ends as bolts to hold his brace ends to the legs. We have rewritten the specification to elucidate the inventor's claim. Should the case meet with favorable consideration a new drawing will be furnished. For the purpose of examination, see pencil sketch on sheet of drawing filed.'\n\n On October 19, 1882, the examiner wrote Cramer, in care of his attorney, as follows:\n'The case has been reconsidered in connection with the substituted specification filed the 17th inst., and the examiner holds that the references previously cited-that of Gregory in particular-meets the alleged invention. The case is accordingly rejected.'\n\n To this letter the following reply was made by the attorneys for Cramer:\n'The examiner will please notice that applicant's invention places both bearings of the treadle in the cross brace.\n\n'By this means they may be made perfectly true in line, \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 272]\n\u00a0\n either by casting or drilling, and they cannot be thrown out of line, either by use, or by the most awkard setting up.\n\n'Therefore, one source of friction is avoided. All the references have shown bearings made of two separate pieces which could readily be set up out of line, or even be worked loose. The advantage is obvious.\n\n A reconsideration is respectfully asked.'\n This closed the correspondence. Soon afterwards notification was given that the patent had been allowed, and letters patent embodying the specification last above set forth, headed 'Treadle for sewing machines,' etc., were issued, bearing date January 30, 1883. The following is a fac simile of the drawing referred to in the specification:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The alleged infringing device is delineated on the following fac simile of the first sheet of the drawing attached to the Diehl patent: \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In this specification Diehl declared his invention to consist in 'certain new and useful improvements in sewing-machine stands and treadles;' and the object to be 'to secure a permanent and reliable support and adjustment for both the band wheel and treadle, and to preserve their respective relative positions, so that they will always cooperate to produce the best results with the least danger of friction or binding.' The claims were five in number, as follows:\n'1. In a sewing-machine stand, a cross brace having supports for both the band wheel and the treadle integral with said brace.\n\n'2. In a sewing-machine stand, a cross brace having supports for both the band wheel and the treadle integral with \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 274]\n\u00a0\n said brace, and provided also with means for adjusting and taking up the wear of such band wheel and treadle.\n\n'3. In a sewing-machine stand, a cross brace adapted to connect the legs or side pieces thereof, provided at one side with bearings for the fly-wheel crank shaft, and having a support at its base for the treadle, substantially as set forth.\n\n'4. The combination, with the cross brace of a sewing-machine stand, of a crank shaft and a treadle, both mounted in the said brace, substantially as set forth.\n\n'5. A cross brace for sewing-machine stands, having at its base a cross bar, combined with a treadle mounted in said cross bar, substantially as set forth.'\n\n To recover damages for alleged infringement of the first claim of the Cramer patent, in the use by the Singer company of the Diehl device just referred to, Cramer brought this action at law against the Singer company on October 8, 1896, in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of California. By amendment of the declaration the recovery was limited to damages sustained by infringements committed within the northern district of California. In the answer filed on behalf of the Singer company,-in addition to excepting to the jurisdiction of the court and pleading as res judicata a former judgment rendered in favor of the defendant in an action brought by Cramer against one Fry, an employee of the Singer company (68 Fed. 201),-defenses were interposed of want of novelty and utility and lack of invention, and infringement was denied.\n A trial was had which resulted (by direction of the court, sustaining the plea of res judicata) in a verdict and judgment for the defendant. This judgment was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit. 35 C. C. A. 508, 93 Fed. 636. On a second trial a verdict was rendered for Cramer and judgment was entered thereon for the sum of $12, 456. On appeal this judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit. 48 C. C. A. 588, 109 Fed. 652. A writ of certiorari was thereafter allowed by this court. \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 275]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles C.Linthicum, Charles K. Offield, and Milton A. Wheaton for petitioner.\n Mr. John H. Miller for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Sixty-eight exceptions were taken by the Singer company during the trial of the action in the circuit court, and were pressed upon the attention of the circuit court of appeals in sixty-nine assignments of error. These exceptions were all in effect relied upon in the argument at bar; but from the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to consider and decide any other assignment than that based upon the exception to the refusal of the court, at the close of all the evidence, to instruct a verdict for the defendant on the ground that 'no infringement whatever had been shown.' As in each of the patents in question it is apparent from the face of the instrument that extrinsic evidence is not needed to explain terms of art therein, or to apply the descriptions to the subject-matter, and as we are able, from mere comparison, to comprehend what are the inventions described in each patent, and, from such comparison, to determine whether or not the Diehl device is an infringement upon that of Cramer, the question of infringement or no infringement is one of law, and susceptible cf determination on this writ of error. Heald v. Rice, \n104 U.S. 737\n, 26 L. ed. 910; Market Street Cable R. Co. v. Rowley, \n155 \nU.S. 621, 625\n, 39 S. L. ed. 284, 287, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224.\n Whether error was committed in refusing to direct a verdict is, then, the question to be decided. The claims of the Cramer patent are two in number, and read as follows:\n'1. The vertical double brace joining the legs of the two ends of a sewing machine, provided with holes through its lower extremities to serve as bearings, in combination with a treadle provided with trunnions fitted to oscillate in said bearings, substantially as specified. \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 276]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. The sewing-machine legs E, the vertical double brace C secured thereto and provided with holes to serve as bearings for the treadle A, and the treadle provided with trunnions B to oscillate in said bearings, in combination with the cushion F and the block f, as and for the purpose specified.'\n\n\n Infringement is charged only in respect to the first claim. In substance, the contention for Cramer is that the conception or idea of the practicability and desirability of utilizing a vertical double brace as a support for a sewing-machine treadle was new with Cramer, and the combination devised by him produced such new and useful results, and exhibited such an exercise of the inventive faculty, as to cause the patent to be a pioneer, and, therefore, entitle the patentee to demand that the claim of the patent should be broadly and liberally construed. For the Singer company it is contended that the availability of use of a vertical cross brace as a support for a sewing-machine treadle was apparent to any person possessing ordinary mechanical skill, that the invention in question if patentable was in no just sense one of a primary nature, and that the combination described by Cramer is to be restricted narrowly to the mere details of the mechanism described as constituting the combination. We must first determine which of these contentions is correct.\n Discussing the significance of the term 'pioneer' as applied to a patented invention, this court, in Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co. \n170 U.S. 537\n, 43 L. ed. 1136, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707, said (p. 561, L. ed. p. 1145, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 718):\n'To what liberality of construction these claims are entitled depends to a certain extent upon the character of the invention, and whether it is what is termed in ordinary parlance a 'pioneer.' This word, although used somewhat loosely, is commonly understood to denote a patent covering a function never before performed, a wholly novel device, or one of such novelty and importance as to mark a distinct step in the progress of the art, as distinguished from a mere improvement or perfection of what had gone before. Most conspicuous examples of such patents are: The one to Howe of the sewing \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 277]\n\u00a0\n machine; to Morse of the electrical telegraph; and to Bell of the telephone. The record in this case would indicate that the same honorable appellation might be safely bestowed upon the original air brake of Westinghouse, and, perhaps, also, upon his automatic brake. In view of the fact that the invention in this case was never put into successful operation, and was to a limited extent anticipated by the Boyden patent of 1883, it is, perhaps, an unwarrantable extension of the term to speak of it as a 'pioneer,' although the principle involved subsequently and through improvements upon this invention became one of great value to the public.'\n\n To ascertain whether the patented invention of Cramer is entitled to be embraced within the term 'pioneer' as just defined. we will consider it in connection with the state of the art.\n In the history of the art it is unquestioned that, long prior to the application by Cramer for the grant of the patent in question, devices similar to the vertical cross brace C and the lower cross bar or tie rod D, shown in the drawing of the Cramer patent, were commonly employed in sewing machines. This is conceded by Cramer in statements made in the progress of his application through the Patent Office. Thus, in the specification which forms a part of the patent the vertical brace C is referred to (italics not in original) as 'the common cast-iron brace C,' and 'the usual cast-iron double brace;' while in the first of the proposed specifications, as well as in that which was finally adopted, the lower bar or tie rod D is referred to (italics not in original) as 'the common cross brace or cross bar.' And in both the first and second specifications the usual purpose subserved in sewing machines by this cross bar was 'to keep them (the machines) from spreading apart.' It is, of course, obvious that such was also the purpose of the employment of the vertical double or cross brace.\n The vertical double cross brace C, as shown in the Cramer drawing, is a solid piece of casting. But it is also an undisputed fact that, long prior to the alleged invention of Cramer, it was a well-known method of construction when revolving \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 278]\n\u00a0\n or oscillating shafts were to be placed in bearings or supports, to have both bearings or supports of such shafts attached to a solid metal casting. Instances of such practices, testified to by witnesses, may be referred to. One was a device to hold a saw mandrel or saw arbor, the former being cast in one piece for the purpose of connecting both journals of the arbor to keep it in absolute line. Another device is the head stock of an ordinary engine lathe or machine lathe, where, in order to have a proper working machine, it is absolutely necessary that the shaft bearings shall be in exact alignment with each other, and firmly in one place. Still another illustrative device employed for a great many years is embodied in a highspeed engine. So, also, in the sewing-machine art, as evidenced by the Wilcox patent No. 106,242 of date August 9, 1870, to be hereafter noticed, the legs of sewing machines had long before Cramer's application been used as bearings for treadle bars, the bearings being cored out of the leg castings.\n A vertical cross brace and a lower cross brace or tie rod being common adjuncts of sewing machines at the time of Cramer's alleged invention, and it being also customary to support the lower cross rod or brace in the web of the legs of sewing machines and to utilize the legs as bearings, and it being old in machinery to employ solid castings as bearings or supports for oscillating shafts to support the lower cross rod or brace in where a fixed alignment was essential, we readily conclude that there was no merit in the mere conception or idea that a vertical double brace was capable of being advantageously utilized as bearings for sewing-machine treadles, and that the devising of means for so utilizing such a brace did not involve such an exercise of the inventive faculty as entitled Cramer to assert in himself a right to claim a patent broadly for the use in combination of a vertical double brace and a sewing-machine treadle. In view of this, and of the fact that the principal elements of the Cramer combination were old, we hold that the Cramer patent was not a primary one, and that it is not, therefore, entitled to receive the broad construction which has been claimed for it. Let us, therefore, \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 279]\n\u00a0\n examine the first claim of the patent in connection with the proceedings in the Patent Office anterior to the allowance of the patent, in order to fix its precise import, as a preliminary to considering whether, as correctly construed, it is infringed by the Singer appliance. The claim reads as follows:\n'The vertical double brace joining the legs of the two ends of a sewing machine, provided with holes through its lower extremities to serve as bearings, in combination with a treadle provided with trunnions fitted to oscillate in said bearings, substantially as specified.'\n\n In the first specification sent to the Patent Office, the object sought to be attained is declared to be the elimination of the noise caused by the operation of a loose treadle, whether used in sewing machines or other machinery. The applicant evidently had in mind treadles which oscillated upon rigid bars and rested on cone bearings or analogous supports, attached to the rigid bars by set screws,-such bearings needing adjustment from time to time as the friction of the parts from the operation of the treadle caused wear and looseness of the parts. It was recited that the treadle bar and the platform on such bar (i. e., the foot rest) was to be cast as one piece. The invention was declared to consist 'in having the ends of the treadle bar V-shaped to fit in hole in brace C, also heart shaped to receive the ends of the treadle bar.'\n The application based upon this first specification was rejected, as mentioned in the statement of facts, upon a reference to the patent to G. W. Gregory, No. 256,563, April 18, 1882, which the examiner stated exhibited 'the alleged invention.' Gregory termed his invention 'an improvement in treadle supports for sewing machines.' It is illustrated in the following fac simile of one of the figures of the drawing of the patent: \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 280]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The invention consisted in attaching to the lower cross bar or rod of a sewing machine two devices styled collars, each collar having two circular openings, one above the other. The upper opening contained a V- shaped bearing. The cross bar was fitted into the lower opening. The treadle or foot rest was provided on each side with short projections termed ears, which fitted on the V-shaped bearings in the upper portion of each collar. The specification contained the following statement:\n'I am aware that V-shaped or scale bearings are old in connection with the sewing-machine treadles,-as, for instance, a long rod to which the treadle is secured has been provided at its ends in the set frames of the machine stand with V-shaped bearings.'\n\n At the close of the descriptive portion of the specification it was further stated:\n'I am aware that sewing-machine treadles have had V-shaped bearings, as in United States patent Nos. 148,759 and 106,242; but neither of said patents shows a bearing constructed in accordance with my invention.'\n\n No. 106,242 was a patent granted to C. H. Willcox on August 9, 1870. It covers the following device: \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The device shows the character of treadle support now employed in the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine. The stand is devoid of a vertical cross brace, the legs of the machine being braced near the bottom by the ordinary cross bar or tie rod. Just above this rod is exhibited the invention, being a 'rockshaft B, beveled at the ends, and provided with V- shaped bearings b, extending to the center of motion of the rockshaft B, and supported in a V-shaped bearing seat a, in combination with a treadle movement.' Elsewhere in the specification the bearings or supports in legs of the machine to receive the ends of the rockshaft B are referred to as 'V-shaped bearings.' The statement is also made that 'The bar is prevented from having any undue lateral movement by the washers upon the ends of the tie rod c, which holds the lower part of the frame together.' An alternate mode of conatruction of the bearings to support the rockshaft was thus described (italics not in original):\n'The V-shaped seat of the bearings a may be formed of a separate piece of hard metal let into a groove in the frame, or otherwise applied to it, and the ends b may be formed also of \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 282]\n\u00a0\n a piece of hard metal, so that the wear of the parts in contact will be very slight, and all rattling or loose jarring motions entirely prevented.'\n\n Although the first refusal to allow a patent was made on May 29, 1882, it was not until August 3 following that the attorneys for Cramer transmitted an amended application to the Patent Office. In the substituted specification the object to be attained is stated as in the previous specification. An addition to the combination was made, however, in the use of what were styled 'mufflers,' against which it was said the ends of the treadle bars were to bear. A patent was again refused, however, the examiner noting that 'applicant's amended claims are met by the patent to J. E. Donovan, June 28, 1881, No. 243,529,'\n The drawing of the Donovan patent exhibits a sewing-machine stand containing a vertical double brace. One form of treadle bar constituting a part of the invention was represented as situated just below the vertical cross brace, and as having a rounded edge, supported in V-shaped bearings, in the legs or sides of the frame. A shouder was indicated on each end of the bar, and a substitute device was also shown called a button fastener, which was to be attached from the outside of the frame to meet the end of the bar. It was said in the specification that the treadle bar might be made of cast iron and cast on and with the treadle. It was further stated ( italics not in original):\n'The bearing supports are preferably made by coring out the frame in the manner shown in the drawings. It is obvious that other forms of supporting these bearings may be provided.'\n\n Several modified forms of ordinary knifeedge bearings and inclined fastening and adjusted devices were also shown. In such modified forms the treadle was represented as designed to oscillate on a rigid bar, in oblong grooves therein; lugs, having knifeedge bearings underneath, being cast on each side of the treadle. Adjustable collars were shown, fastened to the shaft or bar, with inclined lugs on the side of the collars, \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 283]\n\u00a0\n projecting laterally over and resting against shoulders on the lugs upon each side of the treadle. The object of the invention was declared to be ( italics not in original) 'to secure a more substantial table frame to the driving mechanism, and to provide adequate means for the employment of V- shaped treadle bearings, so as to obviate the difficulty heretofore occasioned by lost motion, consisting in vertical and endwise play of the treadle bar or shaft.' It was further observed by the applicant just preceding his statement of claims as follows (italics not in original):\n'Frequent attempts have been made to use knife-edge bearings for the treadle in sewing machines, but it has been found to be difficult to prevent lateral lost motion and to adjust the parts so as to compensate for their wear and to prevent rattling of the treadle, which has been a serious objection in their employment. My herein-described improvements have overcome all the serious objections hitherto attending their use.'\n\n Following the second rejection of his application, Cramer changed his attorneys as mentioned in the statement of facts. In the specification drafted by the new attorneys, and which became the basis of the allowed patent, the asserted invention was limited to its use in sewing machines, eliminating the statement of its adaptability 'in other machinery.' Concerning the 'mufflers,' which in the previous specifications were simply referred to as bearing against the end of the treadle bars, or as being on the ends of such bars, the following statement was made (italics not in original):\n'Pieces of leather F, or other soft material, cover the top and end of each trunnion to serve as cushions to keep the same close in its bearing, to prevent the noise which would result were the trunnions permitted to bounce, and thump endways, when the treadle is in motion. The leather F is fitted to the curve of the upper side of the trunnion, which is an arc of a cylinder whose center of oscillation is the lower edge of the trunnion; the same leather also interposes between the end of the trunnion and the adjacent iron. f is a block serving as a mere backer to which \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 284]\n\u00a0\n the cushion F is at-tached. This block conforms to the back and top side of the cushion and fills the loophole in the brace above the trunnion. It also has tangs or projections e, resting in suitable recesses in the brace C, which are held between the brace and the web of the leg E, by which means the block and cushion are held in place. Below the bearings of the trunnions B, I provide cups, M, attached to the ends of brace C, to catch the oil that usually drips from such bearings.'\n\n It is not a strained deduction that the elaborate provision just referred to, respecting the mode of use of, and the purpose to be subserved by, the mufflers, was, in part at least, induced by the statement in the Willcox and Donovan patents above quoted, concerning the difficulties which existed in connection with the use of knife-edge or Vshaped bearings. Be this as it may, however, we are of opinion that the Patent Office, after twice refusing to allow the patent because of the prior patents referred to, was led to take favorable action, owing to the peculiar form of the described bearing, when situated in a vertical cross brace such as was shown in the drawing, with the described accessories, and that it was the purpose of the Patent Office to limit the patent to the particular device of treadle bar and bearing described and shown when employed in combination with a particular form of vertical cross brace. And this view is supported by the claim in question. It contains words of limitation. It is recited therein that the combination is to be 'substantially as specified,' that is, as described in the specifications and shown in the drawings. Westinghouse v. Boyden Power Brake Co. \n170 \nU.S. 537, 558\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1136, 1144, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707. On referring to the specification we find it there expressly declared that the invention consisted 'in the construction and combination of parts hereinafter fully described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawing.' Nowhere, either expressly or by reasonable inference, is it asserted that simply the best or a preferable construction of the whole or any part of the combination is what is described. On the contrary, starting with the well-known vertical cross brace, a \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 285]\n\u00a0\n usual accessory to sewing machines, a specific mode of construction of the treadle bar and of the bearings or supports in the vertical cross brace is set forth, and the specification is concluded with the following declaration (italics mine):\n'By this construction my treadle bearings are rigidly fixed and in no way liable to get out of line or to require adjustment; the usual noise is prevented, and overflowing of oil is caught before it can do damage.'\n\n To prevent a broadening of the scope of the invention beyond its fair import, in the light of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the patent, the words of limitation contained in the claim must be given due effect, and, giving them such effect, the statement in the first claim of the elements entering into the combination must be construed to refer to elements in combination having substantially the form and constructed substantially as described in the specification and shown in the drawing.\n Having determined the proper construction of the claim of the Cramer patent, which is relied upon, it remains only to consider whether, as correctly construed, infringement resulted from the employment by the Singer company of the device covered by the Diehl patent. We find no difficulty in reaching a conclusion on this branch of the case. The treadle supports devised by Diehl, though they serve the same purpose as the device described and shown in the Cramer patent, are substantially different in construction. Irrespective of the question whether the treadle in the Diehl device is hung in the vertical cross brace proper, or in an addition thereto properly to be regarded as the lower cross rod or cross tie of the machine, it is manifest that the bearing is essentially different in construction from that of Cramer, and is not adapted to receive an oscillating bar; while the treadle is not supplied with long projections fitted to oscillate in the vertical cross bar on bearings therein, but is constructed to turn on point center screws which fit tightly in circular openings in projections from the vertical cross bar. There is \n\n[192 U.S. 265, 286]\n\u00a0\n no substantial identity in the character of the two devices, unless, by substantial identity, is meant every combination which produces the same effect. The differences between the Diehl device and the Cramer construction are substantial, and not merely colorable.\n The trial court should have granted the motion to direct a verdict for the defendant. In affirming the action of the trial court in overruling the motion, the Circuit Court of Appeals erred, and its judgment must, therefore, be reversed. The judgment of the Circuit Court is also reversed and the cause is remanded to that court with directions to grant a new trial, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McKenna took no part in the decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSLATER v. MEXICAN NAT. R. CO.(1904)\nNo. 162\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Mason Williams, C. A. Keller, and E. A. Atlee for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leroy G. Denman, T. W. Dodd, and Denman, Franklin, & McGown for respondent.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought in the United States circuit court for the northern district of Texas by citizens and residents of Texas against a Colorado corporation operating a railroad from Texas to the City of Mexico. The plaintiffs are the widow and children of William H. Slater, who was employed by the defendant as a switchman on its road, and was killed through the defendant's negligence while coupling two freight cars at Nueva Laredo, in Mexico. This action is to recover damages for the death. The laws of Mexico were set forth in the plaintiffs' petition, and the defendant demurred on the ground that the cause of action given by the Mexican laws was not transitory, for reasons sufficiently stated. The demurrer was over- \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n ruled, and the defendant excepted. A similar objection was taken also by plea setting forth additional sections of the Mexican statutes. A demurrer to this plea was sustained, subject to exception. The same point was raised again at the trial by a request to direct a verdict for the defendant. The judge who tried the case instructed the jury that the damages to be recovered, if any, were to be measured by the money value of the life of the deceased to the widow and children, and the jury returned a verdict for a lump sum, apportioned to the several plaintiffs. The judge and jury in this regard acted as prescribed by the Texas Rev. Stat. art. 3027. The case then was taken to the circuit court of appeals, where the judgment was reversed and the action ordered to be dismissed. 53 C. C. A. 239, 115 Fed. 593.\n There is no need to encumber the reports with all the statutes in the record. The main reliance of the plaintiffs is upon the following agreed translation from the Penal Code, bk. 2. 'Civil Liability in Criminal Matters.' 'Art 301. The civil liability arising from an act or omission contrary to a penal law consists in the obligation imposed on the party liable, to make (1) restitution, (2) reparation, (3) indemnization, and (4) payment of judicial expenses.'\n'Art. 304. Reparation comprehends: Payment of all damages caused to the injured party, his family, or a third person for the violation of a right which is formal, existing, and not simply possible, if such damages are actual, and arise directly and immediately from the act or omission complained of, or there be a certainty that such act or omission must necessarily cause a proximate and inevitable consequence.' Coupled with these are articles making railroad companies answerable for the negligence of their servants within the scope of the servants' employment. Penal Code bk. 2, arts. 330, 331; regulations for the construction, maintenance, and operation of railroads, art. 184. We assume for the moment that it was sufficiently alleged and proved that the killing of Slater was a negligent crime within the definition of article 11 of the \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 126]\n\u00a0\n Penal Code, and, therefore, if the above sections were the only law bearing on the matter, that they created a civil liability to make reparation to any one whose rights were infringed.\n\n As Texas has statutes which give an action for wrongfully causing death, of course there is no general objection of policy to enforcing such a liability there, although it arose in another jurisdiction. Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 445\n, 42 L. ed. 537, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105. But when such a liability is enforced in a jurisdiction foreign to the place of the wrongful act, obviously that does not mean that the act in any degree is subject to the lex fori, with regard to either its quality or its consequences. On the other hand, it equally little means that the law of the place of the act is operative outside its own territory. The theory of the foreign suit is that, although the act complained of was subject to no law having force in the forum, it gave rise to an obligation, an obligatio, which, like other obligations, follows the person, and may be enforced wherever the person may be found. Stout v. Wood, 1 Blackf. 71; Dennick v. Central R. Co. \n103 \nU.S. 11, 18\n, 26 S. L. ed. 439, 442. But as the only source of this obligation is the law of the place of the act, it follows that that law determines not merely the existence of the obligation (Smith v. Condry, 1 How. 28, 11 L. ed. 35), but equally determines its extent. It seems to us unjust to allow a plaintiff to come here absolutely depending on the foreign law for the foundation of his case, and yet to deny the defendant the benefit of whatever limitations on his liability that law would impose. In Northern P. R. Co. v. Babcock, \n154 \nU.S. 190, 199\n, 38 S. L. ed. 958, 961, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 978, an action was brought in the district of Minnesota for a death caused in Montana, and it was held that the damages were to be assessed in accordance with the Montana statute. Therefore we may lay on one side as quite inadmissible the notion that the law of the place of the act may be resorted to so far as to show that the act was a tort, and then may be abandoned, leaving the consequences to be determined according to the accident of the place where the defendant may happen to be caught. See further, Pullman Palace Car. Co. v. Laurence, 74 Miss. 782, 801, 802, 22 So. 53; Morris v. \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 127]\n\u00a0\n Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. 65 Iowa, 727, 731, 54 Am. Rep. 39, 23 N. W. 143; Mexican Nat. R. Co. v. Jackson, 89 Tex. 107, 31 L. R. A. 276, 33 S. W. 857; Bruce v. Cincinnati R. Co. 83 Ky. 174, 181; Holmes v. Barclay, 4 La. Ann. 64; Atwood v. Walker, 179 Mass. 514, 519, 61 N. E. 58; Minor, Confl. L. 493,  200. We are aware that expressions of a different tendency may be found in some English cases. But they do not cover the question before this court, and our opinion is based upon the express adjudication of this court, and, as it seems to us, upon the only theory by which actions fairly can be allowed to be maintained for foreign torts. As the cause of action relied upon is one which is supposed to have arisen in Mexico, under Mexican laws, the place of the death and the domicil of the parties have no bearing upon the case.\n The application of these considerations now is to be shown. The general ground on which the plaintiffs bring their suit is, as we have stated, that there is a civil liability imposed on the railroad company arising from an act contrary to the penal law,-a negligent crime, as it is called in the Code. But the Code contains specific provisions for the case of homicide. These necessarily override the merely general rule for torts which also are crimes. Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Hill, \n193 U.S. 551\n, ante, 538, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 538. By article 311 the right is personal to the parties mentioned in art. 318, and is no part of the estate of the deceased. The specific cause of action is the killing of the deceased. So far as appears, apart from that and the following articles, these plaintiffs would have no right of action for the cause alleged. For article 304 seems to presuppose a right in the family, not to create one, and we cannot assume a general right of the members of a family to sue for causing death. By article 318 civil responsibility for a wrongful homicide includes, besides the expenses of medical attendance and burial and damages to the property of the deceased, the expenses 'of the support not only of the widow, descendants, and ascendants of the deceased, who were being supported by him, he being under legal obligations to do so, but also to the posthumous descendants that he may leave.' Then, by article \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 128]\n\u00a0\n 319, the obligation to support shall last during the time that the deceased might have lived, calculated by a given life table, but taking the state of his health before the homicide into consideration; but 'the obligation shall cease: 1. At whatever time it shall not be absolutely necessary for the subsistence of those entitled to receive it. 2. When those beneficiaries get married. 3. When the minor children become of age. 4. In any other case in which, according to law, the deceased, if alive, would not be required to continue the support.' It is unnecessary to set forth the detailed provisions as to support in other parts of the statutes. It is sufficiently obvious from what has been quoted that the decree contemplated by the Mexican law is a decree analogous to a decree for alimony in divorce proceedings,-a decree which contemplates periodical payments, and which is subject to modification from time to time, as the circumstances change. See also, arts. 1376, 1377, of the Code of Procedure, and Penal Code, bk. 2, art. 363.\n The present action is a suit at common law, and the court has no power to make a decree of this kind contemplated by the Mexican statutes. What the circuit court did was to disregard the principles of the Mexican statute altogether and to follow the Texas statute. This clearly was wrong, and was excepted to specifically. But we are of opinion further that justice to the defendant would not permit the substitution of a lump sum, however estimated, for the periodical payments which the Mexican statute required. The marriage of beneficiaries, the cessation of the absolute necessity for the payments, the arising of other circumstances in which, according to law, the deceased would not have been required to continue the support, all are contingencies the chance of which cannot be estimated by any table of probabilities. It would be going far to give a lump sum in place of an annunity for life, the probable value of which could be fixed by averages based on statistics. But to reduce liabilty conditioned as this was to a lump sum would be to leave the whole matter to a mere guess. We may add that by art. 225, concerning alimony, the right \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 129]\n\u00a0\n cannot be renounced, nor can it be subject to compromise between the parties. There seems to be no possibility in Mexico of capitalizing the liability. Evidently the Texas courts would deem the dissimilarities between the local law and that of Mexico too great to permit an action in the Texas state courts. Mexican Nat. R. Co. v. Jackson, 89 Tex. 107, 31 L. R. A. 276, 33 S. W. 857; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. McCormick, 71 Tex. 660, 1 L. R. A. 804, 9 S. W. 540. The case is not one demanding extreme measures, like those where a tort is committed in an uncivilized country. The defendant always can be found in Mexico, on the other side of the river, and it is to be presumed that the courts there are open to the plaintiffs, if the statute conferred a right upon them notwithstanding their absence from the jurisdiction, as we assume that it did, for the purposes of this part of the case. See Mulhall v. Fallon, 176 Mass. 266, 54 L. R. A. 934, 57 N. E. 386.\n So far as appears, the civil liability depends upon penal liability; no different suggestion has been made; and thus far we have taken it for granted that the defendant was within the penal law. The circuit court made the same assumption, although the question was one of fact, in case the jury should find the negligence relied upon to be proved. But whether or not a railroad company was subject to penalty for a homicide caused by the negligence of its servants did not appear. It has occurred to us, although no such argument was made, that it might be sought to sustain the liability on a different ground. The alleged cause of the accident was the different height of the draw heads on two cars which the deceased attempted to couple as they came together. By art. 52 of the Mexican railroad regulations it is required that 'the cars which enter into the make-up of a train shall have draw heads of the same height.' By art. 208 of the same, 'all violations of this law which companies (railroad) commit shall be subject to punishment by the administration of a fine up to $500, which the department of public works shall assess, reserving always the right of individuals through indemnity and the liabilities which the companies may incur through \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 130]\n\u00a0\n criminal acts and omissions committed by them.' It might be argued that these sections, coupled with articles 301 and 304 of the Penal Code, to which we referred in the beginning, were enough to create the liability without regard to the question of homicide. To this it might be enough to answer that it does not appear that a law imposing a fine to be assessed by the department of public works is a penal law within the meaning of the Code,-that, as we have said in a different connection, when the tort relied on is a homicide the specific provisions for homicide override merely general rules, and that the plaintiffs come here relying, as they have to rely, upon a statute which gives them a right of action independent of the deceased, and that the statute is made expressly and only for the case of homicide. Penal Code, bk. 2, art. 311.\n But what we last have said brings into consideration another error of the circuit court which hitherto we have not mentioned. The defendant offered the deposition of a Mexican lawyer as to the Mexican law. This was rejected, subject to exception, seemingly on the ground that the agreed translation of the statutes was the best evidence. So, no doubt, they were, so far as they went, but the testimony of an expert as to the accepted or proper construction of them is admissible upon any matter open to reasonable doubt. Many doubts are left unresolved by the documents before us. The expert would have testified that where no criminal proceedings had been had, the right of the widow and children was dependent upon the court's finding that the killing was a crime as defined by the Penal Code, and that the right was in the nature of alimony or pension, to be paid in instalments for periods of time fixed by the court. Without stating his testimony more fully, we have said enough to show that it should have been received. Seemingly he understood that he was testifying in a case against a railroad, and if so he furnished further reasons for denying any liability except on the footing of homicide. In a case of homicide he excluded the argument that there was a right to a lump sum under articles 301, 304, distinct from the right to alimony, \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 131]\n\u00a0\n and he confirmed the conclusion drawn from the language of the Code as to what would be the nature of a Mexican decree in such a case. There may be other matters which would have to be considered before the verdict could be sustained, but what we have said seems to us sufficient to show that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Peckham, dissenting:\n Slater, the deceased, was a citizen of Texas, residing at Laredo in that state. The Mexican National Railroad Company was a corporation of Colorado, owning and operating a railroad from Laredo to the City of Mexico. Its superintendent resided in Laredo. Slater was fatally injured through the negligence of the company while working in its yard in New Laredo, just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, and died in Laredo from the injuries so inflicted. His wife and children, who resided in Laredo, brought this suit in the circuit court of the United States, diverse citizenship being the ground of jurisdiction, and no objection in that regard arises. Defendant did not 'happen to be caught' in Laredo, but was domiciled there.\n The laws of Texas provided that an action for damages on account of injuries causing death may be brought when the death is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskilfulness, or default of another, and without regard to any criminal proceedings in relation to the homicide. The jury are to give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury resulting from the death, to be divided among the persons entitled in such shares as found by the verdict. The jury pursued that course in this case, under the instructions of the circuit court.\n By the laws of Mexico, damages are recoverable for death by wrongful act, but they, it is said, are awarded as support by decree in the nature of alimony or pension. \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 132]\n\u00a0\n As the two countries concur in holding that the act complained of is the subject of legal redress, the question is whether recovery in this cause must be defeated because the law of Mexico controls and cannot be enforced in Texas.\n It seems to me that the method of arriving at and distributing the damages pertains to procedure or remedy,-that is to say, to the course of the court after parties are brought in, and the means of redressing the wrong,-and I think the general rule that procedure and remedy are regulated by the law of the forum is applicable. 2 Bouvier Law Dict. Rawle's ed. 870; Kring v. Missouri, \n107 U.S. 231\n, 27 L. ed. 509, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443; Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 445\n, 42 L. ed. 537, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105.\n In Northern P. R. Co. v. Babcock, \n154 \nU.S. 190, 199\n, 38 S. L. ed. 958, 961, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 978, the company was not a corporation of Minnesota, and the ruling simply was that the right to recover was governed by the lex loci. The amount found was within the law of Minnesota as well as that of Montana.\n The extent of damages does not enter into any definition of the right enforced or the cause of action permitted to be prosecuted. Finch, J., Wooden v. Western N. Y. & P. R. Co. 126 N. Y. 10, 13 L. R. A. 458, 26 N. E. 1050\n\n\n In Scott v. Seymour, 1 Hurlst. & C. 217, which was an action by one British subject against another for an assault committed in a foreign country, it was held unanimously by the courts of exchequer and of the exchequer chamber that the objection that, by the foreign law, compensation in damages could not be recovered until certain penal proceedings had been commenced and determined there, was an objection to procedure merely, and not a bar to the action in England. And many of the judges were of opinion that an action was maintainable for any act which would have been a tort if done in England, and, whether actionable or not, was unjustifiable or wrongful, in a broad sense, under the law of the foreign country where the act was done.\n Mr. Justice Wightman (Willes, J., in effect concurring) specifically held that if an action would lie by the English law for a particular wrong, the English courts would give redress \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 133]\n\u00a0\n for it, though it was committed in a country by the laws of which no redress would be granted, if the parties were both British subjects.\n This case has never been overruled, and is cited as authority by Mr. Pollock in his work on Torts, 6th ed. p. 201.\n At all events, the rule in England is well settled, as thus laid down in Machado v. Fontes \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 1897]\n\u00a0\n 2 Q. B. 231: 'An action will lie in this country in respect of an act committed outside the jurisdiction if the act is wrongful both in this country and in the country where it was committed; but it is not necessary that the act should be the subject of civil proceedings in the foreign country.' Phillips v. Eyre \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 1870]\n\u00a0\n L. R. 6 Q. B. 1, and The M. Moxham \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 1876]\n\u00a0\n L. R. 1 Prob. Div. 107, were there cited and applied.\n In Phillips v. Eyre, Willes, J., delivering the opinion of the exchequer chamber, said: 'As a general rule, in order to found a suit in England, for a wrong alleged to have been committed abroad, two conditions must be fulfilled: First, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England. . . . Secondly, the act must not have been justifiable by the law of the place where it was done.'\n In The Halley, L. R. 2 P. C. 202, Lord Justice Selwyn, speaking for the court, said: 'It is true that in many cases the courts of England inquire into and act upon the law of foreign countries, as in the case of a contract entered into in a foreign country, where, by express reference, or by necessary implication, the foreign law is incorporated with the contract, and proof and consideration of the foreign law therefore become necessary to the construction of the contract itself. And as in the case of a collision on an ordinary road in a foreign country, where the rule of the road in force at the place of collision may be a necessary ingredient in the determination of the question by whose fault or negligence the alleged tort was committed. But in these and similar cases the English court admits the proof of the foreign law as part of the circumstances \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 134]\n\u00a0\n attending the execution of the contract, or as one of the facts upon which the existence of the tort, or the right to damages, may depend, and it then applies and enforces its own law so far as it is applicable to the case thus established; but it is, in their Lordship's opinion, alike contrary to principle and to authority, to hold that an English court of justice will enforce a foreign municipal law, and will give a remedy in the shape of damages in respect of an act which, according to its own principles, imposes no liability on the person from whom the damages are claimed.'\n The rule in this court goes further, for 'by our law, a private action may be maintained in one state, if not contrary to its own policy, for such a wrong done in another and actionable there, although a like wrong would not be actionable in the state where the suit is brought.' Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 U.S. 670\n, 36 L. ed. 1128, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n It is enough that the act complained of here was wrongful by both the law of Texas and the law of Mexico, and in such a case the action lies in Texas, except where the cause of action is not transitory, but is purely local, such as trespass to land. Dennick v. Central R. Co. \n103 U.S. 11\n, 26 L. ed. 439; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Cox, \n145 U.S. 604\n, 36 L. ed. 833, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905; Ellenwood v. Marietta Chair Co. \n158 U.S. 105\n, 39 L. ed. 913, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 771; Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115, 14 L. ed. 75; MeKenna v. Fisk, 1 How. 241, 11 L. ed. 117.\n It is suggested that the Texas courts have held that there can be no recovery in Texas because of the dissimilarity in the ascertainment of damages between the law of Texas and that of Mexico. And this seems to have been so ruled in Mexican Nat. R. Co. v. Jackson, 89 Tex. 107, 31 L. R. A. 276, 33 S. W. 857; but the question is one of general law, and we are not bound by that ruling. Moreover, the railway company is stated in that case to have been 'a Mexican corporation whose line of railway extended into Texas,' whereas in this case the company is a corporation of Colorado, domiciled in Texas, and whose line of railway extends from Texas into Mexico. Again, after that decision was rendered, in Mexican C. R. Co. v. Mitten, \n\n[194 U.S. 120, 135]\n\u00a0\n 13 Tex. Civ. App. 653, 36 S. W. 282, the company being a Massachusetts corporation and Mitten a citizen of Texas, the court of civil appeals for the fourth district of Texas held to the contrary.\n The court said: 'If the construction placed upon the decision in the Jackson Case be the true one,-and some of its expressions would seem to justify the construction,-it is a practical denial of remedies for wrongs that may be inflicted by one of our citizens upon another in Mexico, . . .' and: 'We are not willing to subscribe to such doctrine, and will not extend the scope of the decision referred to beyond the purview of the facts of that case.'\n The supreme court of Texas apparently accepted this view, for it refused to grant a writ of error to review the judgment. 13 Tex. Civ. App. p. v. And see Evey v. Mexican C. R. Co. 38 L. R. A. 387, 26 C. C. A. 407, 52 U. S. App. 118, 81 Fed. 294.\n I entirely agree with the views expressed in Scott v. Seymour, to which I have referred. The legal relations of Slater with the United States and Texas were not destroyed by his crossing the Rio Grande to work in the railroad yard. This Colorado corporation was domiciled in Texas, as Slater was. The laws of Texas protected them alike. The injury was inflicted in Mexico and resulted fatally in Texas. The wrongful act was actionable in Texas and in Mexico.\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court over person and subject-matter was unquestionable, and I cannot accept the conclusion that the form in which the law of Mexico provides for reparation to its own citizens constitutes a bar to recovery in Texas in litigation between citizens of this country.\n My brothers Harlan and Peckham concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSLOAN v. U S(1904)\nNo. 453\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas L. Sloan, H. C. Brome, Charles E. Clapp, and Andersons & Keefe for appellants.\n Mr. John L.

The actions were brought some time in April, 1901, under the authority of the acts of Congress approved respectively August 15, 1894, and February 6, 1901, permitting persons in whole or in part of Indian blood, and claiming to be entitled to an allotment of land under an act of Congress, to commence an action in the proper circuit court of the United States for the purpose of maintaining their right to such allotment. 28 Stat. at L. 286, 305, chap. 290; amended, 31 Stat. at L. 760, chap. 217.\n Under the authority of these statutes the complainants have brought these actions to obtain allotments in the reservation of the Omaha Indians. Their right thereto is based upon the act of Congress, chapter 434, approved August 7, 1882 (22 Stat. at L. 342, chap. 434), the 5th section of which is set forth in the margin. \n\n[193 U.S. 614, 616]\n\u00a0\n By the act approved March 3, 1893, chapter 209 (27 Stat. at L. 612, 630), the act was amended so as to enlarge somewhat the right to allotments with the consent of the Indians, but the material portion of the act is the original  5, above quoted.\n All of the complainants are of mixed blood, and in their various bills of complaint they insist that they are entitled to allotments under and by virtue of the correct construction of the above act of 1882 and its amendments, and they set up the facts upon which they base their contentions, which included references to the treaties above mentioned. After having stated them, the complainants aver that the defendant, the United States, had theretofore contended that the 4th article of the treaty of March 6, 1865, between the United States and the Indians, confined the right of allotment to the members of the tribe, including their half-breed and mixed blood relatives who were residing with them at the time of the ratification of the treaty, and that neither the complainants nor their ancestors were residing on the reservation at the time, and were therefore not entitled to the land.\n Complainants further stated that the United States had also contended that some of the complainants or their ancestors had received allotments of land under and by virtue of the treaty of July 15, 1830, article 10 thereof, and that, by the acceptance of such allotments, the complainants were not entitled under the statute of 1882 to a second allotment or further participation in the tribal rights of the Omaha tribe of Indians. To these matters of defense the complainants then set up certain facts which they insisted were answers thereto, and that the complainants were therefore entitled under the statute to the allotments claimed by them.\n The United States in its answer did make reference to certain \n\n[193 U.S. 614, 617]\n\u00a0\n treaties it had made with the Omaha Indians. The reference was for the purpose of founding an argument for the construction of the act of 1882, in the manner contended for by it. It urged that the complainants were not entitled to allotments because, among other reasons, they did not reside with the Omaha Indians on their reservation at the time of the ratification of the treaty of 1865; and also that those who had received, or whose ancestors had received, allotments under the treaty of 1830, were not entitled to any further allotment under the act of 1882. The treaties referred to in the answer are the treaty of 1830 (7 Stat. at L. 328, 330, art. 10), and the treaty of 1865 (14 Stat. at L. 667, art. 4). The 10th article of the treaty of 1830 is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n So much of article 4 of the treaty of 1865 as is material upon the question now under consideration is also set forth in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[193 U.S. 614, 618]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that this article of the treaty of 1865 provides for assigning the lands therein mentioned, in severalty, to the members of the tribe, including their half or mixed blood relatives, now residing with them. That is, at the date of the treaty.\n There is another treaty, that of 1854 [10 Stat. at L. 1043], between the United States and the Omaha Indians, which it is not necessary to refer to at length. In it the Indians cede to the United States certain lands therein described, and they reserve certain other lands to themselves. The 6th article permits the President to assign at his discretion the whole or such portion of the lands reserved to the Indians as he may think proper, to be surveyed into lots, and to be assigned by the President to such Indians as were willing to avail themselves of the privilege and would locate on the same as a permanent home, subject to the conditions named in the article. The treaty is not material upon the question of the right to appeal directly to this court, hereinafter discussed.\n Stipulations in regard to the facts in each case were entered into between the parties and testimony also was given upon the various issues between them. The trial court held that the act of 1882 took the place of all previous acts and treaties providing for allotments of land to the Omaha tribe of Indians, including the half or mixed breeds; that the fundamental question was who, under the terms of the act of 1882, were entitled to allotments; that the rights of the complainants \n\n[193 U.S. 614, 619]\n\u00a0\n must be adjudged according to the intent of the act of 1882, and that if a person had a right, within the terms of that act, to an allotment, it could not be denied him simply because he could not be brought within the terms of the treaty of 1865; that the act of 1882 did not restrict the persons to whom allotments were to be made under its provisions to those who resided on the reservation in 1865, but it included all who were in fact members of the tribe, whether of mixed blood or not, residing on the reservation in the tribal relation when the act of 1882 was passed; but such right was not possessed by the mixed bloods who were not living on the reservation as members of the tribe in 1882; that those of mixed blood who had received allotments under the treaty of 1830 were not entitled to any allotments under the provisions of the act of 1882. 118 Fed. 283, 95 Fed. 193.\n The bills were dismissed on the merits in twenty-three out of the twenty-five actions brought in the court below, while the complainants in two of them recovered judgment for an allotment to each. They were Thomas L. Sloan and Garry P. Myers. Sloan was held entitled to an allotment in his own right as an Indian of mixed blood, living on the Omaha reservation at the time of the passage of the act of 1882, although his grandmother, a daughter of a full blood Indian mother, had received an allotment of 320 acres in the Nemaha reservation in 1857, under the treaty of 1830. Myers was held entitled as an Indian of mixed blood and a resident of the Omaha reservation in 1882, the contested question being as to the amount of his allotment,-whether it should be 80 or 160 acres,-and he was held entitled to the latter quantity.\n The appellee has made a motion to dismiss these appeals on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction to hear them, as they do not fall within any of the provisions of  5 of the act of March 3, 1891, and because the respective complainants neither assert nor claim any right to an allotment under or by virtue of any treaty, and the validity or construction of a \n\n[193 U.S. 614, 620]\n\u00a0\n treaty is not drawn in question in these cases. We think the motion should be granted.\n The actions do not, in our judgment, involve the construction of any treaty within the meaning of  5 of the statute of 1891. The complainants in their several bills have based their claims to an allotment upon the act of 1882 and upon the proper construction to be given to its language, which construction, they aver, would recognize their rights to an allotment under the treaties referred to. The United States, in defending against the claims made by the complainants, also relies entirely upon the proper construction of the act of 1882. The construction of a treaty is used only as an argument upon the issue directly in question, viz., the construction of the statute. The alleged right to an allotment being based upon the act of 1882, and the defense being also based upon the proper construction of that act, we cannot but regard the case as one simply resting on such act. The construction of these various treaties was not substantially, or in any other than a merely incidental or remote manner, drawn in question, and therefore a direct appeal to this court cannot be sustained.\n We think the appeals come within the principle of Muse v. Arlington Hotel Co. \n168 U.S. 430\n, 42 L. ed. 531, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867, and Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 U.S. 276\n, 45 L. ed. 527, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368, which hold that where the suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends, it is not a suit under the Constitution or laws, and that jurisdiction cannot, under such circumstances, be maintained of a direct appeal to this court from the circuit court.\n In Muse v. Arlington Hotel Co., it was held that some right, title, privilege, or immunity dependent upon a treaty must be so set up or claimed as to require the circuit court to pass upon the question of the validity or construction of the treaty in disposing of the right asserted. In order to come \n\n[193 U.S. 614, 621]\n\u00a0\n within the act of 1891 the treaty must be directly involved, and upon its construction the rights of the parties must rest. Within these cases it cannot be said that the construction of any treaty is drawn in question herein when the rights of neither party are necessarily dependent upon such construction, but are dependent upon that which may be given the statute of 1882, and when the construction of that statute is independent of that which may be given any of the treaties mentioned, although weight may be given to the treaties in determining the question of the construction of the statute. See also Starin v. New York, \n115 U.S. 248\n, 29 L. ed. 388, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28.\n The motion is granted and the appeals dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n Act of 1882.\n Sec. 5.

CARSON(1904)\nNo. 546\nArgued: Decided: April 18, 1904\n\n\n\n\n Carson, a resident of Greenville county, South Carolina, brought this suit in the court of common pleas of that county against the Southern Railway Company, a corporation chartered under the laws of the state of Virginia, and engaged in running trains through several states as a common carrier, and J. C. Arwood and J. D. Miller, residents of Greenville county, to recover damages for personal injuries, which, he charged in his complaint, 'were due to the joint and concurrent negligence, carelessness, and fault of the defendants, and to their joint and concurrent recklessness, carelessness, wilfulness, and wanton disregard of the plaintiff's rights and safety, in the following manner, to wit:'-setting forth the circumstances of his cause of action. Among other things, plaintiff alleged that he was a flagman in the employment of the Southern Railway Company, and on the day of the accident was ordered by Arwood, the conductor in charge of a certain freight train, on which Miller was engineer, to do the work of brakeman, and to couple some of the cars in the train; that these cars were provided with automatic couplers, but one of them was not in proper condition, which rendered it necessary for plaintiff to go between the cars to effect the coupling; and that the acci- \n\n[194 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n dent thereupon happened by reason of defendants' 'joint and concurrent carelessness, negligence, recklessness,' etc., in particulars detailed.\n Defendants severally demurred, the demurrers were overruled, and defendants excepted. Defendants then answered severally, in identical terms, denying all negligence on the part of defendant, and asserting 'that the plaintiff's alleged injury was the result of his own negligence.' Trial was had and the jury found for plaintiff, against the railway company, judgment was entered, and the railway company appealed to the supreme court of the state. That court affirmed the judgment (46 S. E. 525 ), and thereupon this writ of error was allowed.\nMessrs. W. A. Henderson and T. P. Cothran for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. Altheus Johnson for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes before us on motions to dismiss or affirm. There was certainly color for the motion to dismiss, as we retain jurisdiction with hesitation, and we will dispose of the case on the motion to affirm.\n By some of the many exceptions preserved on the trial, and disposed of by the state supreme court, it was sought to raise Federal questions in respect of the acts of Congress (1) providing for the removal of cases from a state court to a court of the United States, and (2) providing that railroad companies engaged in interstate commerce shall equip their cars with automatic couplers.\n\n 1. \nThe railway company did not at any time apply for the removal of the cases to the circuit court. Plaintiff below and the company's two codefendants were citizens of the same state, and the railway company did not make application to \n\n[194 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n remove before trial on the ground of separable controversy or want of good faith in the joinder. Nor did it make such application when plaintiff's evidence was in, nor on the whole evidence. There was no suggestion throughout the trial that the joinder was in itself improperly made, but the contention, as exhibited by the exceptions, was that a verdict could not be rendered against the company alone, because, if it had been sued alone, it would have had the right of removal. The trial court charged that jury that if the proof failed to show joint and concurrent negligence on the part of all the defendants, yet showed negligence on the part of one or more of them, resulting in injury to plaintiff, as the sole and proximate cause thereof, the jury might find a verdict against such defendant or defendants as the proof showed were guilty of such negligence; and to this instruction the railway company preserved an exception.\n The railway company also excepted to the refusal of the court to give several instructions asked on its behalf, to the effect that, as by the allegation of a joint and concurrent tort, the company had been deprived of the right to remove the cause, joint and concurrent tort must be made out against the company and at least one of the other defendants; that to allow plaintiff to recover without proof of joint and concurrent tort would deprive the company of the right of removal guaranteed by the Constitution and laws; and of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the 14th Amendment, in that the company would be deprived of the right of reimbursement which would otherwise exist. But these are matters upon the merits, and recovery against one of several defendants does not depend on whether, if sued alone, that defendant might have removed the case. The right of removal depends on the act of Congress, and the company not only, on the face of the pleadings, did not come within the act, but it made no effort to assert the right. The rule is well settled, as stated by Mr. Justice Gray in Powers v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co. \n169 U.S. 92\n, 42 L. ed. 673, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 264, 'that an action of \n\n[194 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n tort, which might have been brought against many persons, or against any one or more of them, and which is brought in a state court, against all jointly, contains no separate controversy which will authorize its removal by some of the defendants into the circuit court of the United States, even if they file separate answers, and set up different defenses from the other defendants, and allege that they are not jointly liable with them, and that their own controversy with the plaintiff is a separate one; for, as this court has often said, 'a defendant has no right to say that an action shall be several which the plaintiff seeks to make joint. A separate defense may defeat a joint recovery, but it cannot deprive a plaintiff of his right to prosecute his suit to final decision in his own way. The cause of action is the subject-matter of the controversy, and that is, for all the purposes of the suit, whatever the plaintiff declares it to be in his pleadings.\"\n The view thus expressed was reiterated in Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Dixon, \n179 U.S. 131\n, 45 L. ed. 121, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67, where the subject was much considered, and cases cited. Reference was there made to the fact that many courts have held the identification of master and servant to be so complete that the liability of both may be enforced in the same action. And such is the law in South Carolina. Schumpert v. Southern R. Co. 65 S. C. 332, 95 Am. St. Rep. 802, 43 S. E. 813. In that case it was held that under the state Code of Civil procedure, in actions ex delicto, acts of negligence and wilful tort might be commingled in one statement as causes of injury; that master and servant are jointly liable as joint tort feasors for the tort of the servant, committed within the scope of his employment, and while in the master's service; that the objection that if master and servant were made jointly liable for the negligence of the latter the master could not call on the servant for contribution was without merit, as the rule was, as laid down by Mr. Cooley (Torts, page 145), that: 'As between the company and its servants the latter alone is the wrongdoer, and in calling upon him for indemnity, the company bases no claim upon its own misfeasance or default, but \n\n[194 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n upon that of the servant himself.' And see Gardner v. Southern R. Co. 65 S. C. 341, 43 S. E. 816. In Gucker v. Smoke, 37 S. C. 380, 34 Am. St. Rep. 758, 16 S. E. 40, and Skipper v. Clifton Mfg. Co. 58 S. C. 143, 36 S. E. 509, it was decided that in actions such as this exemplary damages may be recovered. The suggestion that the state deprived the company of its property by the rulings of the supreme court calls for no remark.\n\n 2. \nThe act of March 2, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174), provided, in respect of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, 'that on and after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' The trial court, in one of its instructions, set forth this provision, and told the jury that if they found the railway company was engaged, and these cars were being used, in interstate traffic, and that they were not equipped with the automatic couplers required, such failure was negligence; and it was further charged that railroads were required to keep their appliances in safe and suitable order. It is objected that the instructions assumed that if the automatic coupler was out of repair, the company failed to comply with the act of Congress; but we do not think so, and the supreme court of the state held that there was no error, as Congress must have intended that the couplers should be kept in proper repair for use, and moreover, as such was the law of the state, even if the act of Congress had not specifically imposed this duty. By this ruling no right specifically set up or claimed under the act of Congress by defendant below was decided against. There was no pretence that the act of Congess provided that the automatic couplers need not be kept in order, and whether the cars in question were used in moving interstate traffic and whether the coupling appliances were defective or not, were facts left to the jury, and determined by their verdict. The recovery \n\n[194 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n was not sought on the single ground of want of safe appliances. That was important in its connection with Carson's being ordered to go between the cars, and it was negligence while he was obeying that order, which was chiefly relied on. At all events, the company did not specially set up or claim any right under the act of Congress or dependent on its construction which was denied by the state courts, and the questions raised on these instructions, and numerous others on various aspects of the case, were not Federal questions, and need not be considered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPRECKELS SUGAR REFINING CO. v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2306\n\n\n By agreement of the parties, the issues in the two causes were consolidated and tried as one cause.\n It is conceded that before bringing the actions the plaintiff did all that was required in order to maintain a suit against the collector, and that the payments made by it to that officer were not voluntary.\n The record contains a summary of the returns made by the plaintiff, covering its entire gross receipts from June 14th, 1898, to August 1st, 1900, under these heads: Period Covered by Return; Indebtedness Due Before June 14th, 1898; Amounts Received from Interest, Rent, and Wharfage, and Stevedoring; Sugar Sold Since June 14th, 1898; Gross Receipts; Amount of Tax Paid; and Dates of Payment.'\n The plaintiff contended that for the purposes of the tax in \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 399]\n\u00a0\n question certain things were included, as being part of its gross annual receipts arising from business, which could not properly have been so included, and that no tax could legally have been exacted on account of them. The government insisted that no taxes had been exacted which the law did not require to be paid.\n In its statement of demand the plaintiff alleges that no part of its receipts from other sources than the business of refining sugar was taxable under the provisions of the act; that no tax upon receipts was payable or collectible before the end of the year from the date of the passage of the act; that the administration of the act makes arbitrary, unjust, and illegal discrimination founded on a pretended difference between the business of manufacturing and of refining sugar, between the plaintiff and other persons, firms, corporations, and companies carrying on and doing the business of refining sugar; and that all the provisions of the act subjecting the plaintiff to pay the tax in question were in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and void.\n That statement also shows that upon appeal to the commissioner of internal revenue, it urged the following reasons why the sums it had paid should be refunded: That the act, so far as it assumed to subject corporations or companies carrying on or doing business of refining sugar to pay a special excise tax, was unconstitutional and void; that the tax was a direct tax, which had not been apportioned among the several states as required by the Constitution, was not uniform throughout the United States, and was invalid; that the plaintiff was, and at all times had been, engaged in the business of manufacturing, and not in that of refining, sugar; that it refines sugar only incidentally in the process of manufacture, and is, therefore, not liable for the payment of the tax; that by the provisions of the act the tax was payable annually at the end of each year; and the collection thereof monthly or for periods less than a year and prior to the expiration of the year was illegal, unauthorized, and void; and that the tax was assessed upon, and \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 400]\n\u00a0\n collected from, gross receipts that included receipts outside of those coming from the business of refining sugar; that such gross receipts included receipts from sales of sugar made prior to the passage of the act, from interest on loans and indebtedness, from dividends upon stock owned by the plaintiff in other sugar refining companies, from wharfage collected by it upon wharves owned by it, and from receipts from other sources.\n One of the contentions of the plaintiff was that, apart from its constitutionality, the act of 1898, properly construed, did not embrace the claims here in dispute, and therefore did not authorize the defendant to demand and collect the taxes here in question.\n The cause was determined in the circuit court upon an agreed special verdict of a jury. Some of the positions taken by the plaintiff were sustained while others were overruled. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $1,056.82, the aggregate of the sums paid (with interest thereon) by way of tax upon receipts on business done before the passage of the act, and for stevedoring. 109 Fed. 76. The plaintiff prosecuted a writ of error to the circuit court of appeals, which sustained the judgment, except in one particular, namely, in requiring the plaintiff to pay the tax in question otherwise than annually. 51 C. C. A. 201, 113 Fed. 244. And the case is here upon writ of error sued out by the plaintiff.\n It may be stated that both courts below formally sustained the constitutionality of the act of 1898, remitting that question to this court for full consideration and determination.\nMr. John G. Johnson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 397, 402]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 397, 405]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n We are met at the threshold of this case with a question of jurisdiction raised by the government, which contends that under the existing statutes the judgment of the circuit court of appeals cannot be reviewed by this court, at the instance of the plaintiff, as of right.\n By the 5th section of the judiciary act of March 3d, 1891, appeals or writs of error may be taken from the district courts or from the existing circuit courts direct to this court in certain specified cases, among which is 'any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States,' and, 'any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States . . . is drawn in question.'  5.\n By the 6th section of the same act it is provided that the circuit courts of appeals 'shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review, by appeal or by writ of error [the] final decision in the district court and the existing circuit courts in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law, and the judgments or de- \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 406]\n\u00a0\n crees of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final in all cases in which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being aliens and citizens of the United States or citizens of different states; also, in all cases arising under the patent laws, under the revenue laws, and under the criminal laws, and in admiralty cases, excepting that in every subject within its appellate jurisdiction the circuit court of appeals at any time may certify to the Supreme Court of the United States any question or propositions of law concerning which it desires the instruction of that court for its proper decision. And thereupon the Supreme Court may either give its instruction on the questions and propositions certified to it, which shall be binding upon the circuit courts of appeals in such case, or it may require that the whole record and cause may be sent up to it for its consideration, and thereupon shall decide the whole matter in controversy in the same manner as if it had been brought there for review by writ of error or appeal, and excepting also that in any such case as is hereinbefore made final in the circuit court of appeals it shall be competent for the Supreme Court to require, by certiorari or otherwise, any such case to be certified to the Supreme Court for its review and determination, with the same power and authority in the case as if it had been carried by appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court. In all cases not hereinbefore, in this section, made final, there shall be of right an appeal or writ of error or review of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States where the matter in controversy shall exceed one thousand dollars besides costs.' 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 549, 550).\n This suit was cognizable by the circuit court under the judiciary act of 1887-88, as one arising under both the Constitution and the laws of the United States. 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508. It arose under the Constitution, because the plaintiff's cause of action, as disclosed in its statement of demand, has its sanction in that instrument, if it be true, as alleged, that \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 407]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1898, under which the defendant proceeded when collecting the taxes in question, is repugnant to the Constitution. And it arose under the laws of the United States because it arose under a statute providing for internal revenue. By  629, subdivision 4, of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 503), the circuit courts, without regard to the citizenship of the parties, may take original cognizance of suits arising under a law of that character. That provision has not been superseded by the judiciary act of 1887-88. See also Rev. Stat.  3220, 3226 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2086, 2088).\n Was the judgment of the circuit court subject to review only by this court, or was it permissible for the plaintiff to take it to the circuit court of appeals? If the case, as made by the plaintiff's statement, had involved no other question than the constitutional validity of the act of 1898, or the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, this court alone would have had jurisdiction to review the judgment of the circuit court. Huguley Mfg. Co. v. Galeton Cotton Mills, \n184 \nU.S. 291, 295\n, 46 S. L. ed. 546, 549, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452. But the case distinctly presented other questions which involved simply the construction of the act; and those questions were disposed of by the circuit court at the same time it determined the question of the constitutionality of the act. If the case had depended entirely on the construction of the act of Congress-its constitutionality not being drawn in question-it would not have been one of those described in the 5th section of the act of 1891, and, consequently, could not have come here directly from the circuit court. As, then, the case made by the plaintiff involved a question other than those relating to the constitutionality of the act and to the application and construction of the Constitution, the circuit court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the judgment of the circuit court, although, if the plaintiff had elected to bring it here directly, this court would have had jurisdiction to determine all the questions arising upon the record. The plaintiff was entitled to bring it here directly from the circuit court, or, at its election, to go to the circuit court of appeals for a review of the whole case. Of course, \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 408]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff, having elected to go to the circuit court of appeals for a review of the judgment, could not thereafter, if unsuccessful in that court upon the merits, prosecute a writ of error directly from the circuit court to this court. Robinson v. Caldwell, \n165 U.S. 359\n, 41 L. ed. 745, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 343; Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Ayres v. Polsdorfer, \n187 U.S. 585\n, 47 L. ed. 314, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 196.\n It remains to inquire whether the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was so far final, within the meaning of the 6th section of the act of 1891, that it could not be reviewed here as of right upon writ of error. Can the judgment of that court in this case be re-examined here in any way except upon writ of certiorari granted by this court? The government insists that it cannot, because the case-to use the words of the 6th section of the act of 1891-is one 'arising . . . under the revenue laws.' So far as we now remember, this precise point has not heretofore arisen for our determination. Looking at the purpose and scope of the act of 1891, we are of opinion that the position of the government on this point cannot be sustained. It rests upon an interpretation of the act that is too technical and narrow. The meaning of the words 'arising . . . under the revenue laws,' in the 6th section, is satisfied if they are held as embracing a case strictly arising under laws providing for internal revenues and which does not, by reason of any question in it, belong also to the class mentioned in the 5th section of that act. We do not think that the words quoted necessarily embrace a case carried to the circuit court of appeals, which, although arising under the revenue laws, and involving a construction of those laws, depends, for a full determination of the rights of the parties, upon the construction or application of the Constitution, or upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress. We lean to that interpretation of the act which enables the defeated party in such a case in the circuit court of appeals to have, as of right, upon writ of error to that court, a re-examination here of the judgment (the requisite amount being involved) if the correctness of the judgment depends in whole or in part upon \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 409]\n\u00a0\n the application or construction of the Constitution, or upon the constitutionality of any act of Congress drawn in question.\n What we have said is in harmony with our former decisions, although the precise point here was not involved in any of them. In American Sugar Ref. Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 \nU.S. 277, 280\n, 281 S., 45 L. ed. 859, 861, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646, 647, it was said: 'It was held in Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, where the jurisdiction of the circuit court rested on diverse citizenship, but the state statute involved was claimed in defense to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, that a writ of error could be taken directly from this court to revise the judgment of the circuit court, although it was also ruled that the plaintiff might have carried the case to the circuit court of appeals, and that if a final judgment were rendered by that court against him, he could not thereafter have invoked the jurisdiction of this court directly on another writ of error to review the judgment of the circuit court. . . . If plaintiff, by proper pleading, places the jurisdiction of the circuit court on diverse citizenship, and also on grounds independent of that,-a question expressly reserved in Colorado Cent. Consol. Min. Co. v. Turck, \n150 U.S. 138\n, 37 L. ed. 1030, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 35,-and the case is taken to the court of appeals, propositions as to the latter grounds may be certified, or, if that course is not pursued and the case goes to judgment (and the power to certify assumes the power to decide), an appeal or writ of error would lie under the last clause of  6, because the jurisdiction would not depend solely on diverse citizenship. Union P. R. Co. v. Harris, \n158 U.S. 326\n, 39 L. ed. 1003, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 843.' In Huguley Mfg. Co. v. Galeton Cotton Mills, \n184 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 46 S. L. ed. 546, 549, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452, 454, it was said: 'If after the jurisdiction of the circuit court attaches on the ground of diversity of citizenship, issues are raised the decision of which brings the case within either of the classes set forth in  5, then the case may be brought directly to this court; although it may be carried to the circuit court of appeals, in which event the final judgment of that court could not be brought here as of right. Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 410]\n\u00a0\n \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174. If the jurisdiction of the circuit court rests solely on the ground that the suit arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, then the jurisdiction of this court is exclusive; but if it is placed on diverse citizenship, and also on grounds independent of that, then, if carried to the court of appeals, the decision of that court would not be made final, and appeal or writ of error would lie. American Sugar Ref. Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 U.S. 277\n, 45 L. ed. 859, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646. . . . The ground on which the jurisdiction of the circuit court was invoked was solely diversity of citizenship, and the record does not show anything to the contrary, so that the decree of the circuit court of appeals cannot be regarded otherwise than as made final by the statute.'\n Now, as the judgment of the circuit court of appeals may be brought to this court, as of right, where the jurisdiction of the circuit court rested upon the diversity of citizenship, and also upon grounds that would bring the case within  5 of the act of 1891, it must be held that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals is not final, within the meaning of the 6th section, in a case which, although arising under a law providing for internal revenue and involving the construction of that law, is yet a case also involving, from the outset, from the plaintiff's showing, the construction or application of the Constitution or the constitutionality of an act of Congress.\n For the reasons stated we hold that the plaintiff was entitled, of right, to a writ of error for the review by this court of the judgment of the circuit court of appeals.\n Coming now to the merits of the case, we first notice the contention of the plaintiff that the 27th section of the act of 1898 imposes a direct tax, in violation of the constitutional provision relating to the apportionment of taxes of that kind among the several states.\n The above section of the act of 1898 is as follows: 'Sec. 27. That every person, firm, corporation, or company carrying on or doing the business of refining petroleum, or refining sugar, or owning or controlling any pipe line for transporting oil or \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 411]\n\u00a0\n other products, whose gross annual receipts exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, shall be subject to pay annually a special excise tax equivalent to one quarter of one per centum on the gross amount of all receipts of such persons, firms, corporations, and companies in their respective business in excess of said sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And a true and accurate return of the amount of gross receipts as aforesaid shall be made and rendered monthly by each of such associations, corporations, companies, or persons to the collector of the district in which any such association, corporation, or company may be located, or in which such person has his place of business. Such return shall be verified under oath by the person making the same, or, in case of corporations, by the president or chief officer thereof. Any person or officer failing or refusing to make return as aforesaid, or who shall make a false or fraudulent return, shall be liable to a penalty of not less than one thousand dollars and not exceeding ten thousand dollars for each failure or refusal to make return as aforesaid and for each and every false or fraudulent return.'\n The contention of the government is that the tax is not a direct tax, but only an excise imposed by Congress under its power to lay and collect excises which shall be uniform throughout the United States. Art. 1,  8. Clearly the tax is not imposed upon gross annual receipts as property, but only in respect of the carrying on or doing the business of refining sugar. It cannot be otherwise regarded because of the fact that the amount of the tax is measured by the amount of the gross annual receipts. The tax is defined in the act as 'a special excise tax,' and, therefore, it must be assumed, for what it is worth, that Congress had no purpose to exceed its powers under the Constitution, but only to exercise the authority granted to it of laying and collecting excises.\n This general question has been considered in so many cases heretofore decided that we do not deem it necessary to consider it anew upon principle. It was held in Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 19 L. ed. 95, that the income tax imposed by the \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 412]\n\u00a0\n internal revenue act of June 30th, 1864, amended July 13th, 1866 (13 Stat. at L. 276, chap. 173, 14 Stat. at L. 98, chap. 184), on the amounts insured, renewed, and continued by insurance companies, on the gross amount of premiums received, on dividends, undistributed sums and income, was not a direct tax, but an excise duty or tax within the meaning of the Constitution; in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 19 L. ed. 482, that the statute then before the court, which required national banking associations, state banks, or state banking associations, to pay a tax of 10 per centum on the amount of state bank notes paid out by them, after a named date, did not, in the sense of the Constitution, impose a direct tax, but was to be classed under the head of duties which were to be sustained tained upon the principles announced in Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 19 L. ed. 95; in Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331, 23 L. ed. 99, that the tax imposed on every devolution of title to real estate was not a direct tax, but an impost or excise, and was, therefore, constitutional; in Nicol v. Ames, \n173 U.S. 509\n, 43 L. ed. 786, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522, that the tax imposed (30 Stat. at L. 448, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2306) upon each sale or agreement to sell any products or merchandise at an exchange, or board of trade, or other similar place, either for present or future delivery, was not, in the constitutional sense, a direct tax upon the business itself, but in effect 'a duty or excise law upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility offered at boards of trade or exchanges for the transaction of the business mentioned in the act,' which was 'separate and apart from the business itself;' in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 81\n, 44 S. L. ed. 969, 986, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, that an inheritance or succession tax was not a direct tax on property, as ordinarily understood, but an excise levied on the transmission or receipt of property occasioned by death; and, in Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 609\n, 46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, that the tax imposed by the act of June 13th, 1898, upon tobacco, however prepared, manufactured, and sold, for consumption or sale, was not a direct tax, but an excise tax which Congress could impose; that it was not 'a tax upon property as such, but upon certain kinds of property, having reference to their origin and intended use.'\n In view of these and other decided cases, we cannot hold that \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 413]\n\u00a0\n the tax imposed on the plaintiff expressly with reference to its 'carrying on or doing the business of . . . refining sugar,' and which was to be measured by its gross annual receipts in excess of a named sum, is other than is described in the act of Congress,-a special excise tax, and not a direct one, to be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers. This conclusion is inevitable from the judgments in prior cases, in which the court has dealt with the distinctions, often very difficult to be expressed in words, between taxes that are direct and those which are to be regarded simply as excises. The grounds upon which those judgments were rested need not be restated or re-examined. It would subserve no useful purpose to do so. It must suffice now to say that they clearly negative the idea that the tax here involved is a direct one, to be apportioned among the states according to numbers.\n It is said that if regard be had to the decision in the Income Tax Cases, a different conclusion from that just stated must be reached. On the contrary, the precise question here was not intended to be decided in those cases. For, in the opinion on the rehearing of the Income Tax Cases the Chief Justice said: 'We have considered the act only in respect of the tax on income derived from real estate, and from invested personal property, and have not commented on so much of it as bears on gains or profits from business, privileges, or employments, in view of the instances in which taxation on business, privileges, or employments has assumed the guise of an excise tax and been sustained as such.' \n158 U.S. 601\n, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912.\n The question of the constitutionality of the act having been disposed of, we turn our attention to the questions involving its construction merely.\n As already stated, the judgment of the circuit court determined certain questions for the plaintiff. But as the government did not prosecute a writ of error to the circuit court of appeals those questions cannot be examined here, and we can only consider such points, on the merits of the case, as are raised by the plaintiff's assignments of error. \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 414]\n\u00a0\n It was in proof that the plaintiff owned three wharves on the Delaware river, at which vessels landed, and for the use of which those vessels paid wharfage according to the rates prescribed by a general tariff. A large part, nearly all, of the sugar refined by the plaintiff was brought into the port of Philadelphia by vessels which come to those wharves, and such vessels paid wharfage according to that tariff. Many vessels brought raw sugar which the refining company had purchased abroad. The wharves were built by the plaintiff for the purpose of transacting any business that it might have or for which it saw fit to use them. And nearly all the business done at that time at the wharves was the unloading of sugar consigned to the plaintiff. The exceptions were too few to be regarded as material. Upon its receipts from such wharfage the plaintiff had been compelled to pay a tax. Was it required by the act to pay a tax upon receipts of profits from that source? In other words, were the receipts from wharfage properly included in plaintiff's gross annual receipts upon which the amount of the prescribed tax was to be computed?\n On this question the circuit court said: 'Scarcely any vessels lie at these wharves except the vessels that bring raw sugar to the plaintiff, and the wharves are used for the convenience and greater profit of the corporate enterprise. The money paid by the vessels for wharfage is, I think, areceipt of the business.' The view of the circuit court of appeals was thus expressed: 'The use which the plaintiff really made of its wharves was in 'carrying on or doing the business of . . . refining sugar.' They were part of the plant of that business, and, as it was actually conducted, they were an essential condition of it. Consequently their receipts were its receipts, and as such they were properly comprised in the assessment. Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio, \n165 U.S. 194\n, 41 L. ed. 683, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305.'\n This question is not wholly free from difficulty. But we think the better reason is with the ruling in the circuit court and in the circuit court of appeals, to the effect that the \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 415]\n\u00a0\n wharves, in every substantial sense, constituted a part of the plaintiff's 'plant,' and, if not absolutely necessary, were of great value, in the prosecution of its business; and that receipts derived by plaintiff from the use of the wharves by vessels-particularly because, with rare exceptions, the vessels using them brought to the plaintiff the raw sugar which it refined-were receipts in its business of refining sugar. The primary use of the wharves was in connection with, and in the prosecution of, that business. The importation of raw sugar from abroad was not, in any proper sense, a separate business, but an essential part of the plaintiff's general business of refining sugar. The wharves were part of the instrumentalities and conveniences employed by plaintiff for the successful management and conduct of its business of refining sugar. Without the wharves the gross amount of receipts and profits from such business would probably have been less than they were in fact. If the receipts from the use of the wharves were reasonably to be deemed receipts in the plaintiff's business of refining sugar, as we think they were, then they were properly treated as a part of its gross annual receipts, upon which, in excess of the sum of $250,000, the tax in question was rightly imposed.\n The remaining assignment of error relates to the including in the plaintiff's gross annual receipts of interest paid to it upon deposits in bank and dividends received by it upon shares of stock in other companies. Upon this point Judge McPherson, holding the circuit court, said: 'This interest, I think, was properly included by the collector in determining the annual value of the business. It was corporate property, presumably used for corporate purposes and was as much engaged in the business of refining as the capital invested in machinery or raw materials.' Judge Dallas, with whom concurred Judge Acheson, delivering the judgment of the circuit court of appeals, said: 'The interest received by the plaintiff upon its corporate funds, either deposited in bank or invested in income- producing deposited in bank or invested in income producing The special \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 416]\n\u00a0\n verdict states that it was 'interest upon its investments of moneys and property as explained by the testimony of Mr. Ball,' and it appears from that testimony that the only business of the plaintiff was sugar refining, and that this interest was received by it upon investments or deposits of such part of the capital of that business as at the time being was not in active use therein. Mr. Ball, it is true, also testified that it did not have anything to do with sugar refining, but the question for our decision is not whether this interest was derived from the refining of sugar, which, of course, it was not, but whether or not it was received in the business of sugar refining, and upon this very different question the facts found are conclusive. The funds of the corporation, however any portion of them may have been temporarily applied or held, were all embarked in the sugar refining business, and to it, therefore, all receipts which those funds produced necessarily belonged. Any diminution of them would certainly have been its loss, and it seems to be equally clear that their augmentation, however occasioned, must have been its gain. Except in connection with, and as incidental to, that business, the plaintiff was neither an investor nor a depositor, and therefore, by becoming either the one or the other, it did not engage in an additional and separate business.' Judge Gray, dissenting, said: 'Keeping in mind the well-settled rule that the citizen is exempt from taxation unless the same is imposed by clear and unequivocal language, and that where the construction of a tax law is doubtful, the doubt is to be resolved in favor of those upon whom the tax is sought to be laid, I cannot assent to the affirmance of the judgment of the court below in this respect. I do not think that the income derived from such investment of funds is in any proper sense receipts in the business of sugar refining. The very term 'gross receipts' in 'the business,' would seem to exclude all such receipts as the interest upon investments here referred to.'\n We are of opinion that upon the point last stated there was error. The gross annual receipts, upon which, in excess of a \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 417]\n\u00a0\n certain amount, the tax was imposed, were, under the statute, only receipts in the business of refining sugar, not receipts from independent sources. But, clearly, neither interest paid to the plaintiff on its deposits in bank, nor dividends received by it from investments in the stocks of other companies, were receipts in the business of refining sugar. The moneys deposited by the plaintiff in bank were, we assume, on this record, the profits it had earned in the business in which it was engaged. Profits did not necessarily remain in the business; and whether they would be divided among stockholders or be used in the further prosecution of the business was for the plaintiff to determine. They could have been used for purposes wholly distinct from the business of refining sugar. We are of opinion that the receipts by the plaintiff of interest on its bank deposits had no necessary relation to the business of refining sugar, but rested wholly upon some agreement or understanding between the bank and the depositor, which had no direct connection with that business. And the same thing may be said of plaintiff's investment of its moneys in the stocks of other companies. In the absence of any showing to the contrary, it must be assumed that the declaration or the receipt of dividends on such stocks were wholly apart from the particular business in which the holder of the stock was engaged.\n We hold that in the matter of interest received by the plaintiff on deposits in bank, as well as in the matter of dividends received by it on stocks in other companies, the judgments of both the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals were erroneous.\n The judgment of each court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for such further proceedings as may be necessary for the correction of the errors hereinbefore specified, and as may be in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n The Chief Justice:\n Mr. Justice Brown and myself are of opinion that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals in \n\n[192 U.S. 397, 418]\n\u00a0\n this case was made final in that court by the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, and that, therefore, the writ of error should be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST CLAIR COUNTY v. INTERSTATE SAND & CAR TRANSFER CO(1904)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles W. Thomas for plaintiff in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John F. Lee and George R. Lockwood for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justic e White delivered the opinion the court:\n This suit was commenced in a court of the state of Illinois by the county of St. Clair, a municipal corporation of the state of Illinois, against the Interstate Sand & Car Transfer Company, a Missouri corporation, to recover statutory penalties. We shall hereafter refer to the one party as the county and to the other as the company. The right of the county to recover was based upon the charge that the company had, during certain years, which were stated, incurred penalties to the amount sued for, because it had carried on a ferry for transporting railroad cars, loaded or unloaded, from the county of St. Clair in Illinois to the Missouri shore, and from the Missouri shore to the county of St. Clair, without obtaining a license from the county, as was required by the law of Illinois. The cause of action was thus stated in the complaint:\n'And plaintiff avers that the said defendant, in order to keep and use its said ferry at the time of its establishment as aforesaid, constructed and caused to be built a permanent landing \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n place with certain cradles and roadways thereto, within the limits of said county, and has from thence hitherto maintained the same, by means whereof as well as by means of certain steamboats and barges, then and from thence hitherto used for that purpose by the defendant, it, the said defendant, was enabled to and did, at various times and continuously since the day last aforesaid, ferry for profit and hire, property, to wit, certain railroad cars, from said county across the Mississippi river aforesaid, and from the west bank of said river to the said county, and has so ferried said cars within the time aforesaid to the number of, to wit, 80, 000 railroad cars across said river, without any license from the county board of the plaintiff so to do, whereby and by virtue of the statute in such case made and provided penalties have accrued to the plaintiff in the sum of $3 for each one of said cars so ferried, to wit, the sum of $240, 000.'\n\n The case was removed by the company on diversity of citizenship to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Illinois. In that court the company filed a general demurrer, which was sustained. From the final judgment dismissing the complaint the case was brought directly to this court because solely involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.\n The court below decided that the company was not liable for the penalties, because the law of Illinois purporting to impose upon the company the obligation of taking out a license was not binding, as it was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. The conclusions of the court upon this subject were in substance based on what was deemed to be the result of the rulings in Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 196\n, 29 L. ed. 158, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826, and Convington & C. Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n154 U.S. 204\n, 38 L. ed. 962, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 649, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1087\n\n\n In the argument at bar the county insists that the lower court erred in applying the cases mentioned, because those cases did not question the power of the several states to license and regulate ferries, but prevailed upon other considerations, and \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n hence were inapposite. It is insisted that a consistent line of other cases decided by this court, commencing at an early day, determined that the right to establish, regulate, and license ferries, even though they be across a navigable river constituting a boundary between two states, rests exclusively within the several states, as embraced within police powers reserved to the several states, and not delegated to the national government. On the other hand, the company insists that, whilst undoubtedly there are decisions of this court apparently sustaining the contention of the other side, when properly considered the cases referred to must be limited to ferries over streams wholly within a state, and to the extent that certain of the cases cannot be so limited, they have been in effect overruled. As, then, both sides confidently rely upon prior adjudications of this court, and both in effect argue that the cases which are asserted to sustain the view urged by the other side are in irreconcilable conflict with other cases, it becomes necessary to briefly advert to the cases relied upon by both parties in order to ascertain whether the asserted antagonism between the decided cases really obtains so far as it may be necessary for the decision of the question arising on this record, and if not, to apply the rule settled by the previous cases, and, if the conflict does exist between the adjudications, to determine which of the prior decisions announce the correct rule, and to follow it.\n In Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 23, wherein it was held that the acts of the legislature of New York, granting to Livingston and Fulton exclusive rights to navigation, by steamboats, in the navigable waters within the jurisdiction of the state of New York, was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, in the course of the opinion Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said (p. 65, L. ed. p. 38):\n'Internal commerce must be that which is wholly carried on within the limits of a state; as where the commencement, progress, and termination of the voyage are wholly confined to the territory of the state. This branch of power includes \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n a vast range of state legislation, such as turnpike roads, toll bridges, exclusive rights to run stage wagons, auction licenses, licenses to retailers, and to hawkers and peddlers, ferries over navigable rivers and lakes, and all exclusive rights to carry goods and passengers, by land or water. All such laws must necessarily affect, to a great extent, the foreign trade and that between the states, as well as the trade among the citizens of the same state. But, although these laws do thus affect trade and commerce with other states, Congress cannot interfere, as its power does not reach the regulation of internal trade, which resides exclusively in the states.'\n\n In Fanning v. Gregoire (1853) 16 How. 524, 14 L. ed. 1043, the questioin for decision was whether a subsequent grant of a license for a ferry across the Mississippi river interfered with and violated the rights of a prior license to a ferry of like character. In other words, the question was whether the grant of the first license was exclusive and prevented the grant of a second license. The court decided that the first grant was not exclusive; and in concluding the opinion-speaking through Mr. Justice McLean, and noticing the argument that the guaranty contained in the ordinance of 1787 in respect to the free navigation of the Mississippi river and the power delegated to Congress to regulate commerce between the states were in conflict with the asserted power of the state to grant the second ferry license in question-said (p. 534, L. ed. p. 1047):\n'Neither of these interfere with the police power of the states, in granting ferry licenses. When navigable rivers, within the commercial power of the Union may be obstructed, one or both of these powers may be invoked.'\n\n In Conway v. Taylor (1861) 1 Black, 603, 17 L. ed. 191, the case was substantially this: An exclusive franchise had been granted by the laws of Kentucky to operate a ferry from the Kentucky shore across the Ohio river. A person having commenced to operate a ferry from the Ohio shore to the Kentucky side, in conflict with the exclusive right, his power to do so was resisted in the Kentucky courts on the ground that it was \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n violative of the Kentucky ferry franchise. The courts of Kentucky held that it was in conflict with the Kentucky franchise for the person operating the ferry from the Ohio shore to conduct a ferry from the Kentucky side back to Ohio, and therefore restrained the ferry to that extent. The Kentucky court in effect enforced the exclusive right of the one owning the Kentucky ferry to ferry from Kentucky across to Ohio, but declined to restrain the right of the Ohio ferry owner to ferry from Ohio to Kentucky. The judgment of the Kentucky court came to this court for review, and it was affirmed. In the course of the opinion, announced by Mr. Justice Swayne, it was expressly stated that the right existed in the several states bordering on navigable rivers which were a boundary between two states to grant a ferry privilege from their own borders to cross the river. The court said (p. 629, L. ed. p. 201).\n'The concurrent action of the two states was not necessary. 'A ferry is in respect of the landing place, and not of the water. The water may be to one and the ferry to another.' 13 Vin. Abr. 208a.\n\n ... * *\n'The franchise is confined to the transit from the shore of the state. The same rights which she claims for herself she concedes to others.'\n\n Further along in the opinion (p. 633, L. ed. p. 203), the language which we have previously cited from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden was quoted in part, as follows (italicized as in the reports):\n'The court said: 'They' (state inspection laws) 'form a portion of the immense mass of legislation which embraces everything within the territory of a state not surrendered to the general government; all which can be most advantageously exercised by the states themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a state, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, etc., are parts of this mass.\"\n\n After referring to Fanning v. Gregoire, and citing the passage \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n which we have previously quoted as affirming the doctrine that a state had a right to grant a ferry license across a navigable river, being the boundary between the granting, and another, state, the question of the operation of the commerce clause of the Constitutioin of the United States was passed on. The court declared (p. 633, L. ed. p. 203), that there was no repugnancy to the commerce clause of the Constitution in the mere licensing by a state of a ferry; that the regularity and nature of the business of ferrying was such that the granting of a privilege on the subject did not regulate interstate commerce, and therefore, despite an exclusive ferry privilege, interstate commerce was free from restraint by the state. In conclusion, however, the court pointed out (p. 634, L. ed. p. 203), that undoubtedly if in the grant of a ferry privilege there were contained provisions repugnant to the commerce clause, it would be the duty of the court to prevent their enforcement.\n In Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis (1882) \n107 U.S. 365\n, 27 L. ed. 419, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257, the case was this: The ferry company was in the enjoyment of a ferry franchise to operate across the Mississippi river between Illinois and Missouri. It was domiciled in Illinois, that state being the situs of its boats and other property. This property was taxed in Illinois as other property, and there was also levied upon the company a license tax for the privilege of carrying on the ferry, the validity of which last exaction was the question which the case presented. The collection of the license charge was resisted on the ground that the corporation was exempt by the contract arising from the grant of its franchise from the payment of a license charge, and that if not, the exaction of the license tax for the privilege of ferrying across a navigable river lying between two states was repugnant to the commerce and other clauses of the Constitution of the United States not necessary to be specially referred to.\n After disposing adversely to the corporation of the contention concerning the alleged exemption, the court considered the applicaion of the commerce clause of the Constitution, \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n and decided that proposition against the corporation. In doing so the court referred to the passage in the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, which we have already quoted, and also referred approvingly to the opinions in Conway v. Taylor, 1 Black, 603, 17 L. ed. 191, and Fanning v. Gregoire, 16 How. 524, 14 L. ed. 1043.\n In Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania (1885) \n114 U.S. 196\n, 29 L. ed. 158, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826, the facts were these: The ferry company was incorporated and domiciled in New Jersey, carried on a ferry business over the Delaware river between Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. The situs of its boats and property was in New Jersey; but the company owned in Philadelphia a wharf or slip at which its boats landed. The taxing officers of the state of Pennsylvania assessed against the corporation, on the ground that it was doing business within the state, a tax upon the estimated value of its capital stock, and the validity of this tax was the question decided. After referring to the reasoning of the supreme court of Pennsylvania affirming the validity of the tax, in which it was pointed out that the company did business in the state because it landed in the state of Pennsylvania, and there in part carried on its ferry business, the court said (p. 203, L. ed. p. 161, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 385, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 827):\n'As to the first reason thus expressed, it may be answered that the business of landing and receiving passengers and freight at the wharf in Philadelphia is a necessary incident to, indeed is a part of, their transportation across the Delaware river from New Jersey. Without it that transportation would be impossible. Transportation implies the taking up of persons or property at some point and putting them down at another. A tax, therefore, upon such receiving and landing of passengers and freight is a tax upon their transportation; that is, upon the commerce between the two states involved in such transportation.\n\n'It matters not that the transportation is made in ferryboats, which pass between the states every hour of the day. The means of transportation of persons and freight between the states does not change the character of the business as one \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n of commerce, nor does the time within which the distance between the states may be traversed. Commerce among the states consists of intercourse and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transportation of persons and property, and the navigation of public waters for that purpose, as well as the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities. The power to regulate that commerce, as well as commerce with foreign nations, vested in Congress, is the power to prescribe the rules by which it shall be governed,-that is, the conditions upon which it shall be conducted; to determine when it shall be free and when subject to duties or other exactions. The power also embraces within its control all the instrumentalities by which that commerce may be carried on, and the means by which it may be aided and encouraged.'\n\n After reviewing and applying many prior adjudications of this court, in which the want of power of the several states to burthen interstate commerce had been pointed out, in its various aspects, the court considered the statement of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, which we have previously quoted, and observed (p. 215, L. ed. p. 166, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 390, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 834):\n'The power of the states to regulate matters of internal police includes the establishment of ferries as well as the construction of roads and bridges. In Gibbons v. Ogden, Chief Justice Marshall said that laws respecting ferries, as well as inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws, and laws regulating the internal commerce of the states, are component parts of an immense mass of legislation, embracing everything within the limits of a state not surrendered to the general government; but in this language he plainly refers to ferries entirely within the state, and not to ferries transporting passengers and freight between the states and a foreign country.'\n\n Although no reference was made in the opinion to Fanning v. Gregoire, Conway v. Taylor, and Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, in concluding the opinion it was said (p. 217, L. ed. p. 167, Inters. Com. Rep. p. 390, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 835):\n'It is true that, from the earliest period in the history of the \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 464]\n\u00a0\n government, the states have authorized and regulated ferries, not only over waters entirely within their limits, but over waters separating them; and it may be conceded that in many respects the states can more advantageously manage such interstate ferries than the general government; and that the privilege of keeping a ferry, with a right to take toll for passengers and freight, is a franchise grantable by the state, to be exercised within such limits and under such regulations as may be required for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the public. Still the fact remains that such a ferry is a means, and a necessary means, of commercial intercourse between the states bordering on their dividing waters, and it must, therefore, be conducted without the imposition by the states of taxes or other burdens upon the commerce between them. Freedom from such imposition does not, of course, imply exemption from reasonable charges, as compensation for the carriage of persons, in the way of tolls or fares, or from the ordinary taxation to which other property is subjected, any more than like freedom of transportation on land implies such exemption . . . . How conflicting legislation of the two states on the subject of ferries on waters dividing them is to be met and treated is not a question before us for consideration. Pennsylvania has never attempted to exercise its power of establishing and regulating ferries across the Delaware river. Any one, so far as her laws are concerned, is free, as we are informed, to establish such ferries as he may choose. No license fee is exacted from ferrykeepers. She merely exercises the right to designate the places of landing, as she does the places of landing for all vessels engaged in commerce. The question, therefore, respecting the tax in the present case is not complicated by any action of that state concerning ferries. However great her power, no legislation on her part can impose a tax on that portion of interstate commerce which is involved in the transportation of persons and freight, whatever be the instrumentality by which it is carried on.'\n\n The tax imposed by the state of Pennsylvania was decided \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 465]\n\u00a0\n to be void, as being repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n In Covington & C. Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n154 U.S. 204\n, 38 L. ed. 962, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 649, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1087, a law of the state of Kentucky regulating the tolls to be charged by a bridge company operating a bridge across the Ohio river between Kentucky and Ohio came under review. After an extended consideration of the previous cases, with one exception, including the cases to which we have previously referred, it was decided that, as the bridge was over a navigable stream between two states, the power to regulate the tolls thereon was in Congress, and therefore the state regulation was void.\n The position of the parties as to the cases which we have reviewed is this: The county insists that the statement in Gibbons v. Ogden, that the establishment of ferries was within the reserved powers of the states, and the rulings in Fanning v. Gregoire, Conway v. Taylor, and Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, affirmatively settle that a state may establish ferries over a navigable river, the boundary between two states, and license the same, and that doing so is not only not repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, but is in consonance therewith, since the power as to ferries was reserved to the states, and not delegated to the national government. The Gloucester Ferry Case, it is said, rested upon the nature of the particular tax imposed by the state of Pennsylvania, and that the case may hence not be considered as overruling the previous cases, not only because it did not expressly refer to them, but also because some expressions found in the opinion which we have cited are construed as substantially affirming the right of the state to regulate and license a ferry like the one here in question. On the other hand, the corporation urges that the rulings in Fanning v. Gregoire and Conway v. Taylor proceeded upon a misconception and partial view of the language of Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden. That language, it is insisted, when the sentences which immediately precede the pas- \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 466]\n\u00a0\n sage quoted in Fanning v. Gregoire and Conway v. Taylor, are considered, clearly demonstrates that the Chief Justice was referring to the power of the states to license and control ferries on streams of a local character, and this, it is said, is demonstrated by the statement on the subject in the Gloucester Ferry Case. The case of Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, it is argued proceeded not upon the right of the state over the ferry, but upon its power to tax property whose situs was within its jurisdiction, and this was the view adopted by the court below. The Gloucester Ferry Case, it is urged, did not proceed upon the nature of the tax, but upon the want of power in the state of Pennsylvania to exert its control over a ferry crossing a river which was a boundary between two states, so as in effect to burthen the carrying on of interstate commerce. And that case, it is further insisted, therefore qualifies, if it does not specifically overrule, the earlier cases.\n We do not think, however, that for the purposes of this case we need enter into these contentions, because we consider that in any view which may be taken of the previous cases, each and all of them are conclusive of this case without reference to any real or supposed conflict between them.\n First. None of the cases, whatever view may be taken of them, import power in a state to directly control interstate commerce. Conceding, arguendo, that the police power of a state extends to the establishment, regulation, and licensing of ferries on a navigable stream, being the boundary between two states, none of the cases justify the proposition that such power embraces transportation by water across such a river which does not constitute a ferry in a strict technical sense. In that sense 'a ferry is a continuation of the highway from one side of the water over which it passes to the other, and is for transportation of passengers or of travelers with their teams and vehicles and such other property as they may carry or have with them.' New York v. Starin, 106 N. Y. 11, 12 N. E. 631; Broadmax v. Baker, 94 N. C. 675, 55 Am. Rep. 633. It proceeds \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 467]\n\u00a0\n at regular intervals, and, growing out of the local necessities and the public interest in its operation, is subject to local control, and at common law the exclusive franchise to operate a ferry within designated limits might be conferred upon a particular person or persons. In a strict sense the ferry business is confined to the transportation of persons with or without their property, and a ferryman carrying on only a ferry business is bound to transport in no other way. New York v. Starin, 106 N. Y. 11, 12 N. E. 631; Wyckoff v. Queens County Ferry Co. 52 N. Y. 32, 11 Am. Rep. 650.\n Indeed, the essential distinction between a ferry in the restricted and legal signification of that term and transportation as such, constituting interstate commerce, was pointedly emphasized in a passage from the opinion in Conway v. Taylor, 1 Black, 603, 17 L. ed. 191, which we have previously quoted, and the distinction between the two was necessarily involved, if it may not be said to have been controlling, in the decision of that case\n The difference between of ferry in its true sense and transportation of the character of that now under review is shown in the case of New York v. New England Transfer Co. 14 Blatchf. 159, Fed. Cas. No. 10,197. In that case a boat was operated from Jersey City in New Jersey to Mott Haven in New York, and from Mott Haven to Jersey City. In this boat, by means of tracks, railroad cars, both passenger and freight, were run and carried under contract with the railroad company for the purpose of further transportation. The contention was that the operation of this boat constituted the running of a ferry, and therefore to so operate it required a ferry license from the proper authority of the city of New York. The court (Shipman, J.), whilst not denying the power of the city of New York to require a license for a ferry operating over the route in question, held that the use of the boat in the manner specified was not the operation of a ferry. After pointing out the similarity between bridges and ferries, and directing attention to Proprietors of Bridges v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 1 Wall. 116, 17 L. ed. 571, in which it was \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 468]\n\u00a0\n held that a mere railroad bridge, utilized for the purpose of transporting cars across a navigable river, did not infringe an exclusive right to maintain a bridge for general purposes theretofore granted by state authority, and demonstrating the identity in principle between the case before it and that case, said (p. 167):\n'The reasoning which denies that a railroad bridge is an interference with an exclusive right theretofore granted to build an ordinary bridge, applies with almost equal force to the question, whether a ferry franchise is interfered with by a ferry which is designed for the transportation of railroad cars only. The boat of the defendants is provided with two railroad tracks, which prevent the entrance or egress of ordinary vehicles, and also of foot passengers, except as they are transported in cars which run upon the railroad tracks. The boat is exclusively used for the transportation of railroad cars, in connection only with the arrival of trains. It is impossible to transport ordinary vehicles upon the boat, it is impracticable to transport foot passengers, except as they are conveyed to the boat in cars. The whole arrangement of boat and docks is for the ingress and egress of railroad cars, and not for the accommodation of anything else. The ferry is a part of a continuous through railroad line from places north and east of the city of New York, to places south and southwest of that city, and the trips of the boat are dependent upon the arrival of through railroad trains.\n\n'Such a ferry is unlike an ordinary ferry for the transportation across a river of persons, animals, and freight, at intervals more or less regular, for fare or toll.'\n\n Second. As we conclude from the considerations previously expressed that the transportation of railroad cars-whether loaded ur unloaded-across the Mississippi river at the point in question was not the maintenance of a ferry in the proper sense of that term, and that such business was essentially interstate commerce, the only question remaining for decision \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 469]\n\u00a0\n is, Did the county have the power to require the obtaining of a license by the company as a prerequisite to the carrying on of such interstate commerce, and to impose the penalties sued for because a license had not been obtained? In examining this question we need not stop to determine how far, if at all, a state may, under its general police power, require the taking out of a license for the carrying on of the business of interstate commerce to the extent necessary to enable the state or its subdivisions to exercise such supervision as may be required for the safety of life and property. This results because, even conceding, arguendo, such power, we think it clear that such conditions were attached to the obtaining of a license in this case as relieved the company from the duty of complying with the requirements of the law under which liability is here asserted. That liability is contained in chapter 55 of the Revised Laws of Illinois, in force in 1874. By this law authority was conferred upon the county to grant a ferry license, and it was made the duty of a person or corporation desiring to carry on a ferry to make application for such license. But power was conferred upon the county to withhold the grant of a license in a particular case if deemed best, and to grant it, preferably, to a citizen of the state of Illinois; and the acceptance of the license imposed the absolute obligation upon the applicant to carry on a technical ferry business, to operate at designated hours during the day and during the entire night. In other words, the law under which license was required not only subjected the applicant for the license to discriminatory provisions, but in addition compelled the licensee, if he desired to carry on a purely interstate commerce business, to conduct a general ferry business. However valid these conditions may be when applied to a ferry business in the restricted sense, under the assumption which we have indulged in, arguendo, that the state had the power to regulate a ferry upon a navigable stream forming the boundary between two states, it is obvious that the conditions to which we have alluded were \n\n[192 U.S. 454, 470]\n\u00a0\n illegal because a direct burden upon interstate commerce was made a condition precedent to the doing of business of that character.\n Because we have, arguendo, rested our conclusion in this case upon the assumption that the respective states have the power to regulate ferries over navigable rivers constituting boundaries between states, we must not be understood as deciding that that doctrine, which undoubtedly finds support in the opinions announced in Fanning v. Gregoire and Conway v. Taylor, has not been modified by the rule subsequently laid down in the Gloucester Ferry and the Covington Bridge Cases. As this case has not required us to enter into those considerations we have not done so.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST. LOUIS MIN. & MILL. CO., OF MONTANA v. MONTANA MIN. CO.(1904)\nNo. 250\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a suit brought by the appellee (hereinafter called the Montana company) against the appellants (hereinafter called the St. Louis company) in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Montana, for an injunction restraining the further prosecution of a tunnel. The facts were \n\n[194 U.S. 235, 236]\n\u00a0\n agreed upon, and are substantially that the Montana company was the owner and in possession of the Nine Hour lode mining claim under a patent from the United States, on a location made under the mining acts of 1872 and acts amendatory thereof; that the St. Louis company was the owner of the St. Louis lode mining claim, holding the same under a similar title. In the St. Louis claim is a vein other than the discovery vein, having its apex within the surface limits of the St. Louis claim, but on its dip passing out of the side line of the St. Louis claim into the Nine Hour claim. The tunnel was 260 feet underground, running from the St. Louis into the Nine Hour claim and for the purpose of reaching the vein on its descent through the latter. It was run horizontally through country rock, and between the east line of the St. Louis claim and the vein above referred to will not intersect any other vein or lode. The St. Louis company did not propose to extend the tunnel beyond the point at which it would intersect the vein above referred to, and simply proposed to use this cross-cut tunnel in working and mining said vein. The circuit court, upon the facts agreed to, enjoined the further prosecution of the tunnel. That injunction was sustained by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit (51 C. C. A. 530, 113 Fed. 900) from whose decision the St. Louis company has brought the case to this court.\n Messrs. E. W. Toole and Thomas C. Bach for appellants.\n Mr. W. E. Cullen for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The situation and the question can be easily presented to the mind by considering the significant lines as lines of a right-angled triangle; the vein descending on its dip being the hypothenuse, the tunnel the base line, and the boundary between the two claims the side line of the triangle. The St. Louis \n\n[194 U.S. 235, 237]\n\u00a0\n company, being the owner of the vein, may pursue and appropriate that vein on its course downward, although it extends outside the vertical side lines of its claim and beneath the surface of the Nine Hour lode claim. Such is the plain language of  2322, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1425) which grants to locators 'the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, and of all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically, although such veins, lodes, or ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in their course downward as to extend outside the vertical side lines of such surface locations.'\n In other words, it has a right to the hypothenuse of the triangle. May it also occupy and use the base line? Is it, in pursuing and appropriating this vein, confined to work in or upon the vein, or is it at liberty to enter upon and appropriate other portions of the Nine Hour ground in order that it may more conveniently reach and work the vein which it owns? Its contention is that the mining patent conveys title to only the surface of the ground and the veins which go with the claim, and that the balance of the underground territory is open to anyone seeking to explore for mineral, or at least may be taken possession of by one other than the owner of the claim for the purpose of conveniently working a vein which belongs to him. The question may be stated in another form: Does the patent for a lode claim take the subsurface as well as the surface, and is there any other right to disturb the subsurface than that given to the owner of a vein apexing without its surface, but descending on its dip into the subsurface, to pursue and develop that vein?\n We are of opinion that the patent conveys the subsurface as well as the surface, and that, so far as this case discloses, the only limitation on the exclusive title thus conveyed is the right given to pursue a vein which on its dip enters the subsurface. By  2319, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1424) 'all valuable mineral deposits in \n\n[194 U.S. 235, 238]\n\u00a0\n lands belonging to the United States' are 'open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase.' By  2325 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1429) 'a patent for any land claimed and located for valuable deposits may be obtained in the following manner: Any person . . . having claimed and located a piece of land for such purposes . . . shall thereupon be entitled to a patent for the land.' In a subsequent part of the same section it is provided that the applicant shall pay $5 per acre. Appellants rely upon the clause heretofore quoted from  2322 as a limitation upon the full extent of the grant indicated by these provisions. But this limitation operates only indirectly and by virtue of the grant to another locator to pursue a vein apexing within his surface boundaries on its dip downward through some side line into the ground embraced within the patent. It withdraws from the grant made by the patent only such veins as others own and have a right to pursue. As said by Lindley (1 Lindley, Mines, 2d ed.  71):\n'In other words, under the old law he located the lode. Under the new, he must locate a piece of land containing the top, or apex, of the lode. While the vein is still the principal thing, in that it is for the sake of the vein that the location is made, the location must be of a piece of land including the top, or apex of the vein.'\n\n And in vol. 2 ( 780):\n'Prima facie, such a patent confers the right to everything found within vertical planes drawn through the surface boundaries; but these boundaries may be invaded by an outside lode locator holding the apex of a vein under a regular valid location, in the pursuit of his vein on its downward course underneath the patented surface.'\n\n See also Calhoun Gold Min. Co. v. Ajax Gold Min. Co. \n182 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1200, 1206, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 885. The decisions of the courts in the mining regions are referred to in the opinion of the court of appeals in this case, from which we quote:\n'This view is in accord with the trend of all the decisions to \n\n[194 U.S. 235, 239]\n\u00a0\n which our attention has been directed. In Parrot Silver & Copper Co. v. Heinze, 25 Mont. 139, 53 L. R. A. 491, 87 Am. St. Rep. 386, 64 Pac. 326, the supreme court of Montana held in substance that the owner of a mining claim is prima facie the owner of a vein or lode found at a depth of 1,300 feet within the vertical planes of the lines of his own claim, and that that presumption would prevail until it was shown that the vein had its outcrop in the surface of some other located claim in such a way as to give to the owners of the latter the right to pursue it on its downward course. The court said: 'Upon a valid location of a definite portion of land is founded the right of possession. The patent grants the fee, not to the surface and ledge only, but to the land containing the apex of the ledge. The right to follow the ledge upon its dip between the vertical planes of the parallel end lines extending in their own direction when it departs beyond the vertical planes of the side lines is an expansion of the rights which would be conferred by a common-law grant.' Of similar import is State ex rel. Anaconda Copper Min. Co. v. District Court, 25 Mont. 504, 65 Pac. 1020. In Doe v. Waterloo Min. Co. 54 Fed. 935, Judge Ross said: 'Except as modified by the statute, no reason is perceived why one who acquires the ownership or possession of such lands should not hold them with and subject to the incidents of ownership and possession at common law.' In Consolidated Wyoming Gold Min. Co. v. Champion Min. Co. 63 Fed. 540, Judge Hawley said: 'Hands off of any and everything within my surface lines extending vertically downward, until you prove that you are working upon and following, a vein which has its apex within your surface claim.\"\n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANISLAUS COUNTY v. SAN JOAQUIN & KING'S RIVER CANAL &(1904)\nNo. 80\nArgued: Decided: January 18, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The county above named has appealed directly to this court from a decree of the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of California, setting aside an ordinance adopted by the board of supervisors of Stanislaus county on June 24, 1896, designating the water rates which were to be charged by the company (appellee) to its water consumers for \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n the ensuing year. The appeal here is on the ground that the case involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, under  5 of the act of 1891. (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.)\n The company was incorporated in 1871, under an act of the California legislature approved in 1853 (Stat. of 1853, p. 87), as amended in 1862 ( Stat. of 1862, p. 540). After its incorporation and the obtaining of the necessary land, the company built a canal or reservoir at a cost, as alleged, of about a million dollars, and it is averred that the property was and is of that value. Subsequently to the completion of its works the company furnished water for irrigating purposes to its customers at rates fixed by it, which were not interfered with by the board of supervisors up to the time of the adoption of the above-mentioned ordinance of June 24, 1896. Soon afterwards the company commenced this suit for the purpose of obtaining a decree setting the ordinance aside and declaring it to be null and void, and decreeing that the company was entitled to have the rates for supplying its water to its customers and the users thereof generally so fixed that they would in the aggregate furnish a reasonable and just compensation for the services rendered, and a fair, just, and equitable return therefor.\n The act of 1862 provided in  3 as follows:\n'Every company organized as aforesaid shall have power, and the same is hereby granted, . . . to establish, collect, and receive rates, water rents, or tolls, which shall be subject to regulation by the board of supervisors of the county or counties in which the work is situated, but which shall not be reduced by the supervisors so low as to yield to the stockholders less than 1 1\/2 per cent per month upon the capital actually invested.' [Cal. Gen. Laws, 1850-1864, par. 978.]\n\n On March 12, 1885, the legislature passed an act (Cal. Stat. 1885, page 95) providing for the fixing, by the board of supervisors of a county, of the rates to be collected by water companies. Section 5 of that act authorized the various boards of supervisors in the state to regulate and control the water \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n rates that might be charged in their respective counties by any person, company, association, or corporation, and provided:\n'Said boards of supervisors, in fixing such rates, shall, as near as may be, so adjust them that the net annual receipts and profits thereof to the said persons, companies, associations, and corporations so furnishing such water to such inhabitants shall be not less than 6 not more than 18 per cent upon the said value of the canals, ditches, flumes, chutes, and all other property actually used and useful to the appropriation and furnishing of such water of each of such persons, companies, associations, and corporations; but in estimating such net receipts and profits the cost of any extensions, enlargements, or other permanent improvements of such water rights or waterworks shall not be included as part of the said expenses of management, repairs, and operating of such works, but when accomplished may and shall be included in the present cost and cash value of such work. In fixing said rates, within the limits aforesaid, at which water shall be so furnished as to each of such persons, companies, associations, and corporations, each of said boards of supervisors may likewise take into estimation any and all other facts, circumstances, and conditions pertinent thereto, to the end and purpose that said rates shall be equal, reasonable, and just, both to such persons, companies, associations, and corporations and to said inhabitants.' [Deering's Anno. Codes & Stat. p. 140.]\n\n The complainant alleges in its bill that prior to March 12, 1885, at the time of the passage of the act of that date, the company and its incorporators had actually invested under the authority of the act of 1862 a capital amounting to $971,113.13 in money, all of which was actually, reasonably, and necessarily expended by the complainant in the purchase and construction of its canals and other property actually used in and useful to the appropriation and furnishing of the water, and that the property was, on the last named date, and still is, of the reasonable worth of $971,113.13. The complainant averred that if the act of 1885 was construed as repealing, \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n altering, or amending the provisions of the act of 1862, as to rates to be charged by the company, then that the act of 1885 was in violation of, and repugnant to, the provisions of article I.,  10 of the Constitution of the United States, and, as thus construed, the act of 1885 impaired the obligation of the contract between the state of California and the complainant entered into under the authority of  3 of the act of 1862\n\n\n It was also averred that the rates, as fixed by the board under the act of 1885, would result in taking the property of the complainant without due process of law, and in depriving it of the equal protection of the laws.\n An answer was put in, taking issue with the complainant on the averments in its bill, and a trial was had in the circuit court. That court held (113 Fed. 930) that there was a contract under the act of 1862, as contended for by the complainant; that the act of 1885 could not be so construed as to permit the board of supervisors, in fixing water rates by its authority, to entirely disregard the capital actually invested in the property of the corporation under the act of 1862, and that if otherwise construed the act of 1885 would run counter to the constitutional provision that no law impairing the obligation of a contract should be passed, and the statute would be subjected to the further objection that, as so construed, the state would deprive complainant of its property without due process of law, and would also deny to it the equal protection of the laws, as provided for in the Federal Constitution, and that such provision could not be held subordinate to the constitutional power conferred upon the state legislature to alter, amend, or repeal the general laws concerning corporations. It was also said by the court that it was the duty of the board of supervisors to ascertain the amount of the capital actually invested in the corporation, that is to say, the amount of capital actually paid in and invested in constructing the canals and acquiring the other property used and made useful in supplying water to the customers of the corporation in Stanislaus county, and this fact should have been considered by the \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n board in fixing the water rates which the complainant was entitled to charge under the statute; that when the board of supervisors fixed the rates no consideration was given by it to the evidence showing the amount of the capital actually put into the corporation, or the actual, reasonable, and proper cost of the works; that the evidence establishes the fact that the board failed to perform its duty in this respect, and that by reason thereof it deprived the complainant of its property without due process of law, and denied to it the equal protection of the laws.\n The court found that the evidence showed that the rate fixed by the board of supervisors reduced the income of the company considerably below 6 per cent upon the capital actually invested in the property of the corporation, and if a corresponding reduction were made in Fresno and Merced counties its income would, under the most favorable conditions, be reduced to less than 5 per cent per annum on the value of the property as estimated by the board of supervisors.\n The court also held that the company had waived the right to fix rates as high as permitted under the act of 1862, by failing to make them as high as therein permitted, prior to the passage of the act of 1885, and the act of 1885, 'providing that the net annual receipts as adjusted by the board of supervisors should not be less than 6 nor more than 18 per cent per annum, is therefore properly applicable to the regulation of complainant's rates.'\n Messrs. James P. Langhorne, Duncan Hayne, and F. D. McKenney for appellants.\n Mr. W. B. Treadwell for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n First. The question which first arises in this case is whether \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 206]\n\u00a0\n there was a contract with the company under the act of 1862, by reason of which the state could not thereafter authorize the board of supervisors to reduce the rates so low as to yield less than 1 1\/2 per cent per month upon the capital actually invested.\n The acts of 1853 and 1862 are general laws, the former providing for the formation of corporations of the character named therein, and the latter amending that act, and especially providing for the incorporation of canal companies, and the construction of canals. No special charter was given the company directly from the legislature otherwise than is contained in the powers granted by the two acts above named. A company, although organized under a general statute, may nevertheless thereby enter into and obtain a contract from the state which may be of such a nature that it can only be altered in case power to alter was, prior thereto, provided for in the Constitution or legislation of the state.\n In East Saginaw Salt Mfg. Co. v. East Saginaw, 13 Wall. 373, 20 L. ed. 611, it was said by Mr. Justice Bradley, in delivering the opinion of the court, page 378, L. ed. p. 614, that--\n'Corporations formed under general laws in place of special charters, like the Ohio banks under the general banking law of that state, are entitled to the benefit of specific provisions and exemptions contained in those laws, which are regarded in the same light as if inserted in special charters. 'The act is as special to each bank,' says Justice McLean, delivering the opinion of this court, 'as if no other institutions were incorporated under it.' In such cases the scope of the act takes in the whole period for which the corporation is formed. The language means that, during the existence of any corporation formed under the act, the stipulation or exemption specified in it is to operate.'\n\n The language used in conferring power to fix rates in the act of 1862 is to be taken as if it were contained in a special charter granted by the legislature to this company. The question then arises whether language such as is contained in the 3d \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 207]\n\u00a0\n section of that act, and which is set forth in the foregoing statement of facts, amounts to a contract, to be protected by the Constitution of the United States? We think it does not.\n It seems to us that language of this nature cannot properly be construed as a promise or pledge that the limitation as to rates may not be altered at any time when, in the judgment of the legislature, it may be proper so to do. Water rates which might have been perfectly reasonable at the time of the passage of the act of 1862, although amounting to 1 1\/2 per cent per month upon the capital actually invested, might, in the course of years, become exceedingly burdensome to those who used the water, and amount to a very unreasonable compensation to the company for the water it sold. Irrigation by means of corporations formed to supply water was in its infancy in 1862 in California, and the risks necessarily taken in the organization of such companies, and the prosecution of their work, were then not only very large, but also extremely uncertain in character. Consequently, a rate of compensation was proper at that time which, in the course of years and the accumulated experience as to the necessary cost of such works, and of their successful operation, including the consideration of the risk attendant upon their operation, would make a water rate, as provided by the act of 1862, a very unreasonable overcharge. These facts must have been present in the minds of those who enacted the legislation of 1862, and it would be most unreasonable to suppose that it was intended by any such legislation to forever thereafter tie the hands of the state in regard to all companies organized under the act of 1862, and before the passage of the act of 1885.\n The authority given by the act of 1862 enabled the board of supervisors to conditionally regulate the rates. There is no promise made in the act that the legislature would not itself subsequently alter that authority. The state simply authorized its agents, the boards of supervisors, to regulate rates, but not to reduce them below a certain point. We do not think that from this language a contract can or ought to be \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 208]\n\u00a0\n implied that the state might not thereafter authorize the boards to reduce them, or that it might not itself do so directly. Even as between individuals, such an implication would not be a reasonable one from the language used, and as the contract, if it existed, would take away from the legislature its otherwise undoubted right of regulation upon a subject of great public importance, there is still less reason for implying a contract which would prevent the state from using its power to that end for the future. The language of this portion of the act applies to the boards and limits their right of reduction leaving unhampered the right of the state to interfere directly or by authorizing the boards to reduce the rates below the point stated in the act. In order to make such a contract the language must be plain, and susceptible of no other reasonable construction. Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport City, \n180 U.S. 587\n-599, 45 L. ed. 679-688, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, citing Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 U.S. 307\n-325, 29 L. ed. 636-642, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 334, 388, 1191.\n In our belief, the language of the act of 1862 does not and was not intended to form a contract, but simply amounted to the statement of the then pleasure of the legislature, to so remain until subsequently altered by it. The cases heretofore decided in this court are authority for this view. Some of them are now referred to.\n In Christ Church v. Philadelphia County, 24 How. 300, 16 L. ed. 602, the following language was used in the statute: 'The real property, including ground rents, now belonging and payable to Christ Church hospital, in the city of Philadelphia, so long as the same shall continue to belong to the said hospital, shall be and remain free from taxes.' A subsequent law provided that all property belonging to an association or incorporated company which was then by law exempt from taxation should thereafter be subject to taxation in the same manner as other property. The later law was held not be in violation of the Constitution of the United States. It was held that language such as this was nothing but in the nature of a privilege, which existed only during the pleasure of, and might be revoked by, the sovereign power whenever it chose so to do. \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 209]\n\u00a0\n East Saginaw Salt Mfg. Co. v. East Saginaw, 13 Wall. 373, 20 L. ed. 611, was a case where the court held that the language used was that conferring a bounty, and that it did not amount to a contract in such a sense that it could not be repealed, although it did grant an exemption from taxation of the property used for the purpose of obtaining salt. In regard to the language exempting the property from taxation, the court said:\n'The law in question says to all: You shall have a bounty of 10 cents per bushel for all salt manufactured, and the property used shall be free from taxes. But it does not say how long this shall continue; nor do the parties who enter upon the business promise how long they will continue the manufacture. It is an arrangement determinable at the will of either of the parties, as much so as the hiring of a laboring man by the day.'\n\n In Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527, 22 L. ed. 805, it was also held that an act of the legislature exempting property of a railroad company from taxation was not a contract to exempt it unless there were a consideration for the act; that, without it, the promise was of a gratuity, spontaneously made which might be kept, changed, or recalled, at pleasure, and that the rule applies to the agreements of states made without consideration as well as to those of persons.\n In Welch v. Cook, \n97 U.S. 541\n, 24 L. ed. 1112, the act of the legislative assembly of the District of Columbia of June 26, 1873, exempted from general taxes for ten years thereafter such real and personal property as might be actually employed within the District for manufacturing purposes. It was held that the language did not create an irrepealable contract with the owners of such property, but simply conferred a bounty, liable at any time to be withdrawn.\n In Grand Lodge, F. & A. M. v. New Orleans, \n166 U.S. 143\n, 41 L. ed. 951, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523, the language exempted the property from taxation 'so long as it is occupied as a Grand Lodge of the F. and A. Masons;' and it was held that it did not constitute a contract between the state and the plaintiff, but was a mere continuing gratuity, \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 210]\n\u00a0\n which the legislature was at liberty to terminate and withdraw at any time.\n In Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, decided at this term (\n191 U.S. 379\n, ante, 107, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107), the language of the act was 'That the rate of taxation fixed by this act or any other law of this state shall not apply to any railway or railroad company hereafter building and operating a line of railroad within this state north of parallel forty- four of latitude, until the same has been operated for the full period of ten years, unless the gross earnings shall equal $4,000 per mile.' After the railroad company had been organized, and while that act was in force, and on June 4, 1897, the state passed a law levying a specific tax upon the property and business of every railroad corporation operated within the state. The road in question would have been entitled to the exemption stated in the prior law if it were in force. The railroad contended that it had a contract by virtue of the language above set forth. This court held that no contract arose from the language used, and that consequently the subsequent act providing for taxation did not violate the Federal Constitution in regard to contracts.\n Sufficient cases have been cited to show that language quite as strong as that used in the act of 1862 does not amount to a contract. It is true that the cases cited involved questions of alleged contracts for exemption from taxation, in regard to which it has been said that no presumption exists in favor of a contract by a state to exempt lands from taxation, and that every reasonable doubt should be resolved against it. Statutes of California, providing that the use of all water appropriated for sale, rental, or distribution should be a public use, and subject to public regulation and control, are valid (San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 U.S. 739\n, 43 L. ed. 1154, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 804), and companies formed for the purpose of furnishing water for irrigation purposes have been held in that state to be public municipal corporations, and the use of the water for the purpose mentioned a public use. See cases cited in Fallrook Irrig. Dist. v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 159\n, 41 S. L. ed. 369, 388, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 56. To regulate or establish rates for which \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 211]\n\u00a0\n water will be supplied is in its nature the execution of one of the powers of the state, and the right of the state so to do should not be regarded as parted with any sooner than the right of taxation should be so regarded, and the language of the alleged contract should in both cases be equally plain. Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co. \n191 U.S. 358\n, ante, 82, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 82.\n In our judgment the language of the act of 1862 did not amount to a contract that the rates for the use of water should never be lowered belowe the amount provided for in that act.\n Second. But assuming there was a contract, we think the rates could be changed under that provision of the Constitution of the state adopted in 1849, article 4,  31, which provided:\n'Corporations may be formed under general laws, but shall not be created by special act except for municipal purposes. All general laws and special acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time to time or repealed.'\n\n This court has had frequent occasion to discuss the meaning and extent of the power thus reserved, as it exists in about all the states, either by constitutional or statutory provisions.\n Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454, 21 L. ed. 204, held that the object of reserving a power to amend or repeal (p. 458, L. ed. p. 206) was--\n'To prevent a grant of corporate rights and privileges in a form which will preclude legislative interference with their exercise if the public interest should at any time require such interference. It is a provision intended to preserve to the state control over its contract with the corporators, which, without that provision, would be irrepealable, and protected from any measures affecting its obligation.'\n\n It was also said (p. 459, L. ed. p. 206):\n'The reservation affects the entire relation between the state and the corporation, and places under legislative control all rights, privileges, and immunities, dervied by its charter directly from the state.'\n\n In Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 319\n, 24 L. ed. 357, it was stated that by virtue of the power to alter, revoke, or repeal an act, as provided in \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 212]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of Ohio,  2, article 1, the legislature did not impair the obligation of a contract in prescribing rates for passenger transportation by a new as controlled by the law of New York, original companies, prior to the adoption of the Constitution, was organized under a charter which imposed no limitation as to rates.\n In Close v. Glenwood Cemetery, \n107 U.S. 466\n, 27 L. ed. 408, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267, it was again held that a power reserved in the legislature to alter, amend, or repeal a charter authorizes it to make any alteration or amendment of the charter granted subject to it, which will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant, or any rights vested under it, and which the legislature may deem necessary to secure either that object or any public right.\n The same principle was decided in Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 720\n, 25 S. L. ed. 496, 501; New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 U.S. 556\n, 38 L. ed. 269, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, and United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n160 \nU.S. 1, 33\n, 40 S. L. ed. 319, 330, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190.\n Covington v. Kentucky, \n173 U.S. 231\n, 43 L. ed. 679, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383, decided that language describing certain property, and providing that it should be and remain forever exempt from state, county, and city tax, did not prevent the legislature from withdrawing such exemption, and subjecting the property to taxation, in view of the statute that all charters and grants of the corporations should be subject to amendment or repeal at will of the legislature. Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the opinion of the court, said (p. 238, L. ed. p. 682, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 386):\n'We are of opinion that the exemption from taxation embodied in that act did not tie the hands of the commonwealth of Kentucky so that it could not, by legislation, withdraw such exemption, and subject the property in question to taxation. The act of 1886 was passed subject to the provision in a general statute of Kentucky, above referred to, that all statutes 'shall be subject to amendment or repeal at the will of the legislature, unless a contrary intent be therein plainly expressed.' If that act in any sense constituted a contract between the city and the commonwealth, the reservation in an \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 213]\n\u00a0\n existing general statute of the right to amend or repeal it was itself a part of that contract.'\n\n To the same effect is Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 U.S. 434\n, 47 L. ed. 887, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531.\n These cases also hold that there is a limitation, even to the power of amendment, when reserved in the constitution or a statute of a state. Some of the cases, although holding that the power to amend or repeal was properly exercised in them, also state that the power is not without limit; that the alterations must be reasonably made, in good faith, and consistent with the scope and object of the act of incorporation, and that sheer oppression and wrong could not be inflicted under the guise of amendment or alteration; that beyond the sphere of the reserved powers the vested rights of property in corporations in such cases are surrounded by the same sanction and are as inviolable as in other cases. In reiterating this view of the power, we think that a mere reduction of rates, while still leaving reasonable, fair, or just compensation for the use of the property, is not prohibited, and we are quite clear that, even assuming there was a contract, the legislature nevertheless had the power to so alter and amend the act of 1862 as to provide for the fixing of rates as set forth in the act of 1885.\n It is not confiscation, nor a taking of property without due process of law, nor a denial of the equal protection of the laws, to fix water rates so as to give an income of 6 per cent upon the then value of the property actually used for the purpose of supplying water as provided by law, even though the company had, prior thereto, been allowed to fix rates that would secure to it 1 1\/2 per cent a month income upon the capital actually invested in the undertaking. If not hampered by an unalterable contract, providing that a certain compensation should always be received, we think that a law which reduces the compensation theretofore allowed to 6 per cent upon the present value of the property used for the public is not unconstitutional. There is nothing in the nature of confiscation about it. \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 214]\n\u00a0\n The original cost may have been too great; mistakes of construction, even though honest, may have been made, which necessarily enhanced the cost; more property may have been acquired than nessary or needful for the purpose intended. Other circumstances might exist which would show the original rates much too large for fair or reasonable compensation at the present time. Notwithstanding such facts, are the shareholders in the company to be forever entitled to 18 per cent upon this cost, and does a reduction in amount, as provided for in the act of 1885, take away property, in violation of the provisions of the Federal Constitution? We think not.\n In this case much of the total amount expended in the course of the construction of the works was not proved by those who made such expenditures, and the items and total amount of the cost of construction were only proved by the books. What such books did not prove was the reasonableness of that cost, its propriety or necessity. There were statements that appeared in the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders which were put in evidence, that showed at least a dispute as to the proper cost of the works, and at one of these meetings a shareholder said there had been a waste in the management of the affairs of the company amounting to $350,000, which was caused by the chief engineer, who had been in charge of the canal, and that his mistakes had cost the company a good deal of money. There would seem to have been more of a dispute as to who was responsible for this loss than over the fact of loss. At another meeting held in December, 1881, the president had said in his remarks to the meeting that, in his opinion, with careful management the canal would pay a fair revenue on what it ought to have cost. Although these minutes did not conclusively prove the fact of the excessive cost of the work, yet, where the books of the company were substantially the only evidence of the amount expended, and there was no other satisfactory evidence of the reasonableness of the expenditures, it would not be surprising if the board should have \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 215]\n\u00a0\n regarded the statements in the minutes relating to excessive cost as a justification, if not a requirement, for the reduction of the cost of construction, upon which rates might be fixed, by at least the amount mentioned,-$350,000.\n Other considerations, in the shape of facts, circumstances, and conditions pertinent to the alleged cost of the work, and appearing in the course of the inquiry, may have been considered by the supervisors, and the conclusion arrived at, after a consideration of all the material facts, that the rates fixed would result in justice to both the company and the consumers, as called for by the act.\n Judging by this record, we are unable to say the board of supervisors failed to provide just and fair compensation for the use of the property by the public.\n In San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 U.S. 739\n, 43 L. ed. 1154, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 804, it was held (following Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 543\n, 544 S., 42 L. ed. 819, 848, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418), that what the company was entitled to demand in order that it might have just compensation was a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it was being used for the public. The appellants in that case contended that in fixing what were just rates the court should take into consideration the cost of the plant and of its annual operation, the depreciation of the plant, and a fair profit to the company above its charges for its services. It was observed by the court that undoubtedly all these matters ought to be taken into consideration and such weight be given them, when rates are being fixed, as, under all the circumstances, would be just to the company and to the public. The same principle is reaffirmed in San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 442\n, 47 S. L. ed. 892, 894, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571.\n After taking such facts into consideration, the company might still be directed to receive rates that would be nothing more than a fair and just compensation or return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it was being used for the supplying of the water to the public.\n To take the amount actually invested into 'estimation' does not mean necessarily that such amount is to control the \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 216]\n\u00a0\n decision of the question of rates. Other language would have been employed to express that thought. The cost may be estimated, says the act, but that leaves open a reference to the other facts adverted to in the latter part of  5, and it is upon a consideration of the whole case that the board is to determine what shall be reasonable, just, and equal to all parties. The record would seem to show that the board did take these various matters into consideration in coming to the conclusion it did in regard to the value of the property, although giving much less weight to such alleged cost than the company thought was proper. The board added over $25,000 to the amount proved as the present cost of the construction of the canals, based on the prices of material, supplies, and labor, of the date when the estimate was made, that estimate being $312,000, while the board fixed the valuation at $337,000.\n Much of the capital was invested between twenty and thirty years ago, and to be able still to realize 6 per cent upon the money originally invested is more than most people are able to accomplish in any ordinary investment, and more than is necessary in order to give just compensation for property at the time it is used for the public purpose originally intended.\n It is, of course, impossibel to say what rates may be adopted in the other counties through which this canal runs, and that is one of the embarrassments under which the parties suffer from the language of the statute of 1885. Heretofore the company has fixed its own rates therein. Exactly how the question may be hereafter determined as to the percentage of income, where there are three different boards of supervisors who may fix rates for their respective counties, each differing from the other, is not made clear by the statute. The complainant admits that the rates provided for by the supervisors under the act of 1885, if applied to all three counties, would allow complainant an income of substantially 6 per cent on $337,000, being $25,000 more than the present cost of the work would be, as shown by uncontradicted and satisfactory evidence. Those rates exist in the other counties at present. \n\n[192 U.S. 201, 217]\n\u00a0\n Hereafter, in case the other counties should fix rates in such manner that, taken as a whole, the rates in the three counties would not insure an income of at least 6 per cent, as provided for in the act of 1885, the company would, of course, not be bound to accept such rates, and a decree in this case would not bind it in regard to the propriety of rates for the future, as fixed by the ordinance of 1896 for the county of Stanislaus.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed and the bill dismissed without prejudice.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA v. NORTHERN SECURITIES CO.(1904)\nNo. 433\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. Douglas, M. D. Munn, and George P. Wilson for appellant.\n Messrs.

Clough for appellees.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 48, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n By a statute of Minnesota passed March 9th, 1874, it was pro- \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 57]\n\u00a0\n vided that no railroad corporation or the lessees, purchasers, or managers thereof should consolidate the stock, property, or franchises of such corporation with, or lease or purchase the works or franchises of, or in any way control, any other railroad corporation owning or having under its control a parallel or competing line; nor should any officer of such corporation act as an officer of any other railroad corporation owning or having the control of a parallel or competing line; and the question whether railroads were parallel or competing lines should, when demanded by the party complainant, be decided by a jury as in other civil issues. Minn. Laws, 1874, p. 154.\n A subsequent statute, passed March 3d, 1881, provided that any railroad corporation, either domestic or foreign, whether organized under a general law or by virtue of a special charter, might lease or purchase, or become owner of or control, or hold the stock of, any other railroad corporation, when the respective railroads could be lawfully connected and operated togther 'so as to constitute one continuous main line, with or without branches,'  1; and that any railroad corporation, whose lines of railroad within or without the state might be lawfully connected and operated together to constitute one continuous main line, so as to admit of the passage of trains over them without break or interruption, 'could consolidate their stock and franchises so as to become one corporation.'  2. But by the same statute it was provided that no railroad corporation should consolidate with, lease, or purchase, or in any way become owner of, or control, any other railroad corporation, or any stock, franchises, rights of property thereof, which owned or controlled 'a parallel or competing line.'  3. Minn. Laws, 1881, p. 109.\n At a later date, 1899, the legislature of Minnesota passed another statute relating principally to such restraints upon trade and commerce as interfered with competition among those engaged therein. That statute contained these provisions: \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 58]\n\u00a0\n ' 1. Any contract, agreement, arrangement, or conspiracy, or any combination in the form of a trust, or otherwise, hereafter entered into which is in restraint of trade or commerce within this state, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any of the people of this state and any of the people of any other state or country, or which limits or tends to limit or control the supply of any article, commodity, or utility, or the articles which enter into the manufacture of any article [of] utility, or which regulates, limits, or controls or raises or tends to regulate, limit, control, or raise the market price of any article, commodity, or utility, or tends to limit or regulate the production of any such article, commodity, or utility, or in any manner destroys, limits, or interferes with open and free competition in either the production, purchase, or sale of any commodity, article, or utility, is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful.  2. That when any corporation heretofore or hereafter created, organized, or existing under the laws of this state, whether general or special, hereafter unites in any manner with any other corporation wheresoever created, or with any individual, whereby such corporation surrenders or transfers, by sale or otherwise, in whole or in part, its franchise, rights, or privileges, or the control or management of its business to any other corporation or individual, or whereby the business, management, or control of the business of such corporation is limited, changed, or in any manner affected, and the purpose or effect of such union or combination is to limit, control, or destroy competition in the manufacture or sale of any article or commodity, or is to limit or control the production of any article or commodity, or is to control of fix the price or market value of any article or commodity, or the price or market value of the material entering into the production of any article or commodity, or in case the purpose or effect of such union or combination is to control or monopolize in any manner the trade or commerce, or any part thereof, of this state or of the several states, such union, combination, agreement,* arrange- \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 59]\n\u00a0\n ment, or contract is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful. . . .  3. Any corporation heretofore or hereafter created, organized, or existing under the laws of this state, which shall hereafter, either directly or indirectly make any contract, agreement, or arrangement, or enter into any combination, conspiracy, or trust, as defined in  1 of this act, shall, in addition to the penalty prescribed in  2 of this act, forfeit its charter, rights, and franchises, and it shall thereafter be unlawful for such corporation to engage in business, either as a corporation or as a part of any combination, trust, or monopoly, except as to the final disposition of its property under the laws of this state. . . .  6. That for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act any citizen of this state may, and it is hereby declared to be the duty of the attorney general to, institute, in the name of the state, proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction against any person, partnership, association, or corporation who may be guilty of violating any of the provisions of  1 of this act, for the purpose of imposing the penalties imposed by this act, or securing the enforcement of  3 hereof.' Minn. Gen. Laws, 1899, chap. 357.\n These statutes being in force, the state of Minnesota instituted this suit in one of its own courts against the Northern Securities Company, a corporation of New Jersey; the Great Northern Railway Company, a corporation of Minnesota; the Northern Pacific Railway Company, a corporation of Wisconsin, which, having filed its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state of Minnesota, became subject to the laws of that state relating to railroad corporations; and James J. Hill, as president of the Northern Securities Company, and individually.\n What is the nature of the case as disclosed by the complaint filed in the state court?\n The complaint alleged--\n That the Great Northern Railway Company and the North- \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 60]\n\u00a0\n ern Racific Railway Company each owned or controlled and maintained a system of railways connecting the Great Lakes and the Pacific ocean, their main roads constituting, substantially, parallel and competing lines;\n That pursuant to an agreement between the defendant Hill and other stockholders of the Great Northern Railway Company (representing a controlling interest in the stock of that company) and J. Pierpont Morgan and other stockholders of the Northern Pacific Railway Company ( representing a controlling interest in the stock of that company) the Northern Securities Company was incorporated solely as an instrumentality through which the stock, property, and franchises of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies should be consolidated in effect, if not in form, and the management and control of their business affairs, respectively, including the fixing of rates and charges for the transportation of passengers and freight over any and all of the lines of railway of each of those companies, as well within as without the state, be vested in and controlled by the Securities Company, and all competition in freight and passenger traffic between the two systems of railway, within and without the state, to be suppressed and removed; that by means of such arrangement it was sought and intended to ignore, evade, and violate the laws of the state prohibiting as well the consolidation of the stock, property, or franchise of parallel or competing lines of railway therein, and the control or management thereof, as all combinations in restraint of trade or commerce within the state, and between the people of Minnesota and the people of other states and countries; and that, if the Securities Company was allowed to hold and control the stocks of the constituent railway companies, and to carry out the purpose and object of its incorporators as well as its own, 'full faith and credit will not be given to the public acts of this complainant, and it will be deprived of a further right guaranteed to it by the Constitution of the United States.'\n That the said scheme had been consummated, and said two \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 61]\n\u00a0\n railway systems were now under the absolute management and control of the Securities Company, and 'by reason thereof all competition between said lines has been destroyed and a monopoly in railway traffic in Minnesota ( as well as without said state) has been created, to the great and permanent and irreparable damage of the state of Minnesota, and to the people thereof, and in violation of its laws, and of the laws of the United States in such case made and provided, viz.: The act of Congress approved July 2d, 1890, entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies' [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200];' and\n That the carrying out the above agreements and plan of consolidation and monopoly, and in every step taken to consummate it, the officers and directors of each of said railway companies were severally fully advised and consented thereto, and, unless restrained by this court, the Securities Company would continue to manage and control the business and affairs of Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, and to suppress all competition between them for freight and passenger traffic, as well as to monopolize railway traffic in that state, to the irreparable damage of the state and the people thereof.\n The substantial relief asked was a decree declaring, among other things, the alleged agreement and combination to be unlawful, and all acts done and to be done in pursuance thereof contrary to, and in violation of, the laws of Minnesota and of the United States; prohibiting the Securities Company, its agents and officers, from acquiring, receiving, holding, voting, or in any manner acting as the owner of any of the shares of the capital stock of either the Northern Pacific or the Great Northern Railway Company, or from exercising any management, direction, or control over the constituent companies; and enjoining those railway companies from recognizing or accepting the Northern Securities Company as the holder or owner of any shares of the capital stock of either of those companies, or from effecting any combination or agreement \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 62]\n\u00a0\n that would disturb their independent integrity, management, and control, respectively, or that would, directly or indirectly, destroy free and unlimited competition between them by interchange of traffic, poolings of earnings, division of property, or otherwise.\n The Securities Company, appearing specially for that purpose, filed its petition for the removal of the case into the circuit court of the United States upon the ground that the suit was of a civil nature, in equity, involved, exclusive of costs, the sum of $2,000, and was one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n The state court approved the required statutory bond for removal, and made an order reciting that the case was removed to the Federal court.\n The Northern Securities Company, appearing specially for that purpose, gave notice of a motion to have the service of summons upon it vacated. Notice was also given of a like motion as to the service of summons upon defendant Hill in his capacity as president of that company. Subsequently, the company, and defendant Hill as its president, gave notice that the above notices were withdrawn, and they accordingly entered their appearance in the cause.\n At a later date the defendants severally answered, and the state filed its replication to each answer. Proofs were taken, and, the cause having been heard, the bill was dismissed upon the merits. 123 Fed. 692.\n After the cause was argued here the parties were invited to submit briefs upon the question whether the circuit court of the United States could take cognizance of the case upon removal from the state court. From the briefs filed in response to that invitation it appeared that both sides deemed the case a removable one, and insist that this court should consider the merits as disclosed by the pleadings and evidence. But consent of parties can never confer jurisdiction upon a Federal court. If the record does not affirmatively show jurisdiction in the circuit court, we must, upon our own \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 63]\n\u00a0\n motion, so declare, and make such order as will prevent that court from exercising an authority not conferred upon it by statute.

Rep. 63.\n We proceed, therefore, to inquire whether the circuit court could take cognizance of this case upon removal from the state court, and make a final decree upon the merits.\n Of course, the circuit court could not take cognizance of the case as one presenting a controversy between citizens of different states, for the state of Minnesota is not a citizen within the meaning of the Constitution or the acts of Congress. Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Alabama, \n155 U.S. 487\n, 39 L. ed. 232, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192.\n But the 1st section of the judiciary act of 1887-8 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373, 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), provides, among other things, that the circuit courts of the United States may take original cognizance of all suits of a civil nature at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds in value the sum of $2,000. And the 2d section provides for the removal from a state court of 'any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . of which the circuit courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction by the preceding section.'\n In Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 \nU.S. 454, 461\n, 38 S. L. ed. 511, 514, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654, 657, which involved the scope and meaning of the acts of 1887-8, in respect of cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, this court, after referring to  1 said: 'But the corresponding clause in  2 allows removals from a state court to be made only by defendants, and of suits 'of which the circuit courts of the United States are given \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 64]\n\u00a0\n original jurisdiction by the preceding section,' thus limiting the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States on removal by the defendant under this section to such suits as might have been brought in that court by the plaintiff under the first section. 24 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 373; 25 Stat. at L. 434, chap. 866 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508). The change is in accordance with the general policy of these acts, manifest upon their face, and often recognized by this court, to contract the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States.' Mexican Nat. R. Co. v. Davidson, \n157 \nU.S. 201, 208\n, 39 S. L. ed. 672, 675, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563; Metcalf v. Watertown, \n128 U.S. 586\n, 32 L. ed. 543, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 173. And in Chappell v. Waterworth, \n155 \nU.S. 102, 107\n, 39 S. L. ed. 85, 87, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 34, 36, the court, referring to Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, said that it was there adjudged, upon full consideration, that, under the act of 1887-8, 'a case (not depending on the citizenship of the parties nor otherwise specially provided for) cannot be removed from a state court into the circuit court of the United States, as one arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, unless that appears by the plaintiff's statement of his own claim; and that, if it does not so appear, the want cannot be supplied by any statement in the petition for removal, or in the subsequent pleadings.' To the same effect are Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Alabama, \n155 U.S. 487\n, 39 L. ed. 232, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192; United States v. American Bell. Teleph. Co. \n159 \nU.S. 548, 553\n, 40 S. L. ed. 255, 257, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 69; Oregon Short Line & U. N. R. Co. v. Skottowe, \n162 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1048, 1050, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 869; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Cody, \n166 \nU.S. 606, 608\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1132, 1134, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703; Pratt v. Paris Gaslight & Coke Co. \n168 \nU.S. 255, 258\n, 42 S. L. ed. 458, 459, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62; Walker v.

Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867. These cases establish, beyond further question in this court, the rule that, under existing statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, a case cannot be removed from a state court as one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, unless the plaintiff's complaint, bill, or declaration shows it to be a case of that character. 'If it does not appear at the outset,' this court has quite recently said, 'that the suit is one of which the circuit court at the time its jurisdiction \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 65]\n\u00a0\n is invoked could properly take cognizance, the suit must be dismissed.' Third Street & Suburban R. Co. v. Lewis, \n173 \nU.S. 457, 460\n, 43 S. L. ed. 766, 767, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 451.\n We must then, inquire whether the complaint presents a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, in respect of which the original jurisdiction of the circuit court could have been invoked by the state.\n The real purpose of the suit was to annul the agreement and suppress the combination alleged to exist between the defendant corporations, upon the ground that such agreement and combination were in violation, first, of the laws of Minnesota, and, second, of the anti-trust act of Congress. If relief had been asked upon the ground alone that what the defendant corporations had done and would, unless restrained, continue to do, was forbidden by the statutes of Minnesota, the circuit court of the United States could not have taken cognizance of the case; for confessdly such a controversy would not have been one between citizens of different states, nor could such a suit have been deemed one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n The contention, however, is that a case arising under the laws of the United States was presented by the allegation in the complaint that the combination and consolidation between the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies and the control of their affairs and operations by the Northern Securities Company were also in violation of the anti- trust act of Congress of July 2d, 1890. An allegation in a complaint filed in a circuit court of the United States may, indeed, in a sense, confer jurisdiction to determine whether the case is of the class of which the court may properly take cognizance for purposes of a final decree on the merits. Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, \n193 U.S. 561\n, ante 553, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553, and Pacific E. R. Co. v. Los Angeles (decided at present term) 193 U. S. --, ante, 586, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 586. But if, notwithstanding such an allegation, the court finds, at any time, that the case does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy within its jurisdiction, then, by the \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 66]\n\u00a0\n express command of the act of 1875, its duty is to proceed no further. That is manifest from the 5th section of that act, which provides: 'That if, in any suit commenced in a circuit court or removed from a state court to a circuit court of the United States, it shall appear, to the satisfaction of said circuit court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court, or that the parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under this act, the said circuit court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the court from which it was removed, as justice may require, and shall make such order as to costs as shall be just.' 18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508). That provision has not been superseded by any subsequent legislation.\n Does the present suit really and substantially involve a dispute, or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of the circuit court? That is to say, could the suit, as disclosed by the complaint, have been brought by the state originally in that court? If it could not, then, under the act of 1887-8 and the adjudged cases, it should not have been removed from the state court, and should be remanded.\n By the 1st section of the anti-trust act every contract, combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, is declared to be illegal. The 2d section condemns the monopolizing or attempting to monopolize, or combining or conspiring to monopolize, any part of such trade or commerce. By the 3d section, every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of commerce in any territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any such territory and another, or between any such territory or territories and any state or states or the District of Columbia, or \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 67]\n\u00a0\n with any foreign states, or between the District of Columbia and any state or states or foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. A violation of the provisions of each section is made a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. Of course, a criminal prosecution under the act must be in the name of the United States and in a court of the United States,-the district attorney who conducts the prosecution being subject to the direction of the Attorney General as to the manner in which his duties shall be discharged. Rev. Stat. 362 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 208).\n The 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th sections of the act are as follows:\n' 4. The several circuit courts of the United States are hereby invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this act; and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case; and, pending such petition, and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed just in the premises.'\n\n' 6. Any property owned under any contract or by any combination or pursuant to any conspiracy (and being the subject thereof) mentioned in section one of this act, and being in the course of transportation from one state to another, or to a foreign country, shall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the forfeiture, seizure, and condemnation of property imported into the United States contrary to law. \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 68]\n\u00a0\n ' 7. Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act may sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n' 8. That the word 'person,' or 'persons,' wherever used in this act, shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under, or authorized by, the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the territories, the laws of any state, or the laws of any foreign country.' 26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200).\n\n It thus appears that the act specifies four modes in which effect may be given to its provisions. It is clear that the present suit does not belong to either of those classes. It is not a criminal proceeding ( 1, 2, 3), nor a suit in equity in the name of the United States to restrain violations of the anti-trust act ( 4), nor a proceeding in the name of the United States for the forfeiture of property being in the course of transportation ( 6), nor an action by any person or corporation for the recovery of three-fold damages for injury done to business or property by some other person or corporation. ( 7, 8.)\n But it is said that as the act of Congress was for the benefit of all the states and all the people, this case is to be deemed one arising under the laws of the United States, and, therefore, cognizable by the circuit court, because one of the objects of the state of Minnesota by its suit is to protect certain of its proprietary interests, which, it is alleged, would be injured by violations, on the part of the defendants, of the act of Congress. Let us see what, in that view, is the case as presented by the complaint.\n The complaint alleged that the state is the owner of more than three million acres of land, of the value of more than fifteen millions of dollars, obtained, by donation, from the United States, and that 'the value of said lands, and the \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 69]\n\u00a0\n salability thereof, depends, in very large measure, upon having free, uninterrupted, and open competition in passenger and freight rates over the lines of railway owned and operated by said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies.'\n The bill also alleges 'that many of said lands are vacant and unsettled and located in regions not at present reached by railway lines, and depend for settlement upon the construction of lines in the future; that it has heretofore been the practice of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, respectively, to extend spur lines into territory adjacent to each of said roads, as well as into new territory, for the purpose of developing such territory, as well as to obtain traffic therefrom; that such new lines have been built in the past very largely by reason of the rivalry heretofore existing between said companies for existing, as well as new, business; that under the consolidation and unity of control hereinafter set forth such rivalry will cease, and many of the lands now owned by the state of Minnesota will not be reached by railroads for years to come, if at all, owing to such combination and consolidation removing all rivalry and competition between said companies; that the settlement and occupation of said lands will add very much to their value, and such occupation will depend entirely upon the accessibility of railway lines and transportation facilities for marketing the products raised thereon; that if said lands are sold and become occupied, they will add very largely to the taxable value of the property of the state, and that said lands cannot be so sold, or the income of the state increased thereby, without the construction of railroad lines to, or adjacent to, the same.'\n It was further alleged that the state is the owner of, and has maintained at large expense, a state university, hospitals for the insane, normal schools for teachers, a training school for boys and girls, schools for deaf, dumb, blind, and feeble-minded persons, a state school for indigent and homeless children, and a state penitentiary; that a great portion of the supplies of every kind for such institutions must, of necessity, be shipped \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 70]\n\u00a0\n over the different lines of railway owned and operated by the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway Companies; that the amount of taxes which the state must collect, and the successful maintenance of its public institutions, as well as the performance of its governmental functions and affairs, depend largely upon the value of the real and personal property situated within the state, and the general prosperity and business success of its citizens; and that such prosperity and business depend very largely upon maintaining in the state free, open, and unrestricted competition between the railway lines of those two companies.\n The injury on account of which the present suit was brought is at most only remote and indirect; such an injury as would come alike, although in different degrees, to every individual owner of property in a state by reason of the suppression, in violation of the act of Congress, of free competition between interstate carriers engaged in business in such state; not such a direct, actual injury as that provided for in the 7th section of the statute. If Minnesota may, by an original suit, in its name, invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court, because, alone, of the alleged remote and indirect injury to its proprietary interests arising from the mere absence of free competition in trade and commerce as carried on by interstate carriers within its limits, then every state, upon like grounds, may maintain, in its name, in a circuit court of the United States, a suit against interstate carriers engaged in business within their respective limits. Further, under that view, every individual owner of property in a state may, upon like general grounds, by an original suit, irrespective of any direct or special injury to him, invoke the original jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States, to restrain and prevent violations of the anti-trust act of Congress. We do not think that Congress contemplated any such methods for the enforcement of the anti- trust act. We cannot suppose it was intended that the enforcement of the act should depend in any degree upon original suits in equity instituted by the states or by \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 71]\n\u00a0\n individuals to prevent violations of its provisions. On the contrary, taking all the sections of that act together, we think that its intention was to limit direct proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations of the anti-trust act as cause injury to the general public, or to all alike, merely from the suppression of competition in trade and commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, to those instituted in the name of the United States, under the 4th section of the act, by district attorneys of the United States, acting under the direction of the Attorney General; thus securing the enforcement of the act, so far as direct proceedings in equity are concerned, according to some uniform plan, operative throughout the entire country. Possibly the thought of Congress was that by such a limitation upon suits in equity of a general nature to restrain violations of the act, irrespective of any direct injury sustained by particular persons or corporations, interstate and international trade and commerce, and those carrying on such trade and commerce, as well as the general business of the country, would not be needlessly disturbed by suits brought, on all sides and in every direction, to accomplish improper or speculative purposes. At any rate, the interpretation we have given of the act is a more reasonable one. It is a safe and conservative interpretation, in view as well of the broad and exclusive power of Congress over interstate and international commerce as of the fact that, so far as such commerce is concerned, Congress has prescribed a specific mode for preventing restraints upon it,-namely, suits in equity under the direction of the Attorney General. Of the present suit the Attorney General has no control, and is without any responsibility for the manner in which it is conducted, although, in its essential features, it is just such a suit as would be brought by his direction when proceeding under the 4th section of the anti-trust act.\n The state presents still another view of the question of jurisdiction. Its complaint alleges that if the Securities Company be allowed to hold and control the stocks of the Great Northern \n\n[194 U.S. 48, 72]\n\u00a0\n and Northern Pacific Railway Companies and to carry out the purpose and object of its incorporation, full faith and credit will not be given to the public acts of the state. This, it is contended, presents a case arising under article 4 of the Constitution, providing that 'full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.' It is said by the state's counsel that the 'gravamen of the charge in appellant's complaint is that the defendants created a corporate device in New Jersey, and used it for the purpose and with the result that property rights in Minnesota were affected, in violation of its laws. Our contention is that article 4 must be so construed as to make the constitutional enactments of Minnesota effective throughout the United States, so far as they apply to and affect property rights within the state. Otherwise the policy and laws of any state may be easily evaded.' We do not think that the clause of the Constitution above quoted has any bearing whatever upon the question under consideration. It only prescribes a rule by which courts, Federal and state, are to be guided when a question arises in the progress of a pending suit as to the faith and credit to be given by the court to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of a state other than that in which the court is sitting. Even if it be assumed that the word 'acts' includes 'statutes,' the clause has nothing to do w with the conduct of individuals or corporations; and to invoke the rule which it prescribes does not make a case arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n What was the duty of the circuit court when it ascertained that the suit was not one of which it could take cognizance? The answer is indicated by the clause of the judiciary act of March 3d, 1875, to which we have adverted.\n For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the suit does not-to use the words of the act of 1875-really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of the circuit court for the purposes of a final decree.

STATE OF NEBRASKA(1904)\n\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1904\n\n\n\n This is a case of disputed boundary between two states of the Union.\n The suit was commenced by an original bill filed in this court by the state of Missouri against the state of Nebraska. The relief sought by the former state is a decree declaring its right of possession of, and its jurisdiction and sovereignty over, certain territory east and north of the center of the main channel of the Missouri river as it runs between the two states at the present time; that Missouri be quieted in its title thereto; and that the state of Nebraska be forever enjoined and restrained from disturbing Missouri in the full enjoyment and possession of said territory.\n The state of Nebraska, after answering, filed a cross bill \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n asking a decree confirming the possession, jurisdiction, and sovereignty of Nebraska over said territory; that the boundary line between that part of Missouri known as Atchison county and that part of Nebraska known as Nemaha county, be ascertained and established, and permanent monuments erected to indicate the location of such line; and that the state of Missouri be enjoined and restrained from disturbing the state of Nebraska in the full enjoyment and possession of said territory.\n The commissioners heretofore appointed to take the evidence have filed their report, and it is agreed that their finding of facts is correct. The case is before us upon questions of law arising out of the pleadings, the report of the commissioners, and the stipulation of the parties.\n By an act of Congress of March 6th, 1820, provision was made for the admission of Missouri into the Union with the following boundary: 'Beginning in the middle of the Mississippi river, on the parallel of thirty-six degrees of north latitude; thence west, along that parallel of latitude, to the San Francois river; thence up and following the course of that river, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the parallel of latitude of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes; thence west along the same to a point where the said parallel is intersected by a meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas river, where the same empties into the Missouri river; thence from the point aforesaid, north, along the said meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines, making the said line to correspond with the Indian boundary line; thence east from the point of intersection last aforesaid, along the said parallel of latitude, to the middle of the channel of the main fork of the said river Des Moines; thence down and along the middle of the main channel of the said river Des Moines to the mouth of the same, where it empties into the Mississippi river; thence due east to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river; thence down and following the course \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n of the Mississippi river, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the place of beginning: Provided, That said state shall ratify the boundaries aforesaid: (a) And provided also, That the said state shall have concurrent jurisdiction on the river Mississippi, and every other river bordering on the said state, so far as the said river shall form a common boundary to the said state and any other state or states, now or hereafter to be formed and bounded by the same, such rivers to be common to both; and that the river Mississippi, and the navigable rivers and waters leading into the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said state as to other citizens of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor imposed by the said state.' 3 Stat. at L. 545, chap. 22.\n On the 15th day of January, 1831, the state of Missouri, speaking by its legislature, memorialized Congress to make more certain and definite its northwest boundary. That memorial, among other things, stated: 'When this state government was formed, the whole country on the west and north was one continued wilderness, inhabited by none but savages, and but little known to the people or to the government of the United States. Its geography was unwritten, and none of our citizens possessed an accurate knowledge of its localities, except a few adventurous hunters and Indian traders. The western boundary of the state, as indicated by the act of Congress of the 6th of March, 1820, and adopted by the Constitution of Missouri, is a 'meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas river, where the same empties into the Missouri river,' and extends from the parallel of latitude of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north, 'to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines.' The part of this line which lies north of the Missouri river has never been surveyed and established, and consequently its precise position and extent are unknown. It is believed, however, that it extends about 100 miles north from the Missouri \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n river, and almost parallel with the course of the stream, so as to leave between the line and the river a narrow strip of land, varying in breadth from 15 to 30 miles. This small strip of land was acquired by the United States from the Kansas Indians, by the treaty of the 3d of June, 1825 [7 Stat. at L. 244], and is now unappropriated and at the free disposal of the general government. . . . These considerations seem to us sufficiently obvious to impress upon the public mind the necessity of interposing, whenever it is possible, some visible boundary and natural barrier between the Indians and the whites. The Missouri river, bending as it does, beyond our northern line, will afford the barrier against all the Indians on the southwest side of that river, by extending the north boundary of this state in a straight line westward, until it strikes the Missouri, so as to include within this state the small district of country between that line and the river, which we suppose is not more than sufficient to make two, or at the most three, respectable counties. . . . In every view, then, we consider it expedient that the district of county in question should be annexed to and incorporated with the state of Missouri; and to that end we respectfully ask the consent of Congress. . . . With these views of the present condition and future importance of that little section of country, and seeing the impossibility of conveniently attaching it now or hereafter to any other state, your memorialists consider it highly desirable, and indeed necessary, that it should be annexed to and form a part of the state of Missouri. And to the accomplishment of that desirable end we respectfully request the assent of Congress.'\n A subsequent act, entitled 'An Act to Extend the Western Boundary of the State of Missouri to the Missouri River,' approved June 7th, 1836, provided: 'That when the Indian title to all the lands lying between the state of Missouri and the Missouri river shall be extinguished, the jurisdiction over said lands shall be hereby ceded to the state of Missouri, and the western boundary of said state shall be then extended to the \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n Missouri river, reserving to the United States the original right of soil in said lands, and disposing of the same: Provided, That this act shall not take effect until the President shall, by proclamation, declare that the Indian title to said lands has been extinguished; nor shall it take effect until the state of Missouri shall have assented to the provisions of this act.' 5 Stat. at L. 34, chap. 86.\n It is alleged in the bill that Congress intended by the act of 1836 to meet the wishes of Missouri as expressed in its memorial; that after the passage of that act the President, by proclamation [5 Stat. at L. 802] declared that the Indian title to the lands covered by that act had been extinguished; and that Missouri duly assented to its provisions.\n By an act of Congress approved February 9th 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 391, chap. 36], Nebraska was admitted into the Union, with the following boundary: 'Commencing at a point formed by the intersection of the western boundary of the state of Missouri with the fortieth degree of north latitude; extending thence due west along said fortieth degree of north latitude to a point formed by its intersection with the twenty-fifth degree of longitude west from Washington; thence north along said twenty- fifth degree of longitude to a point formed by its intersection with the forty-first degree of north latitude; thence west along said forty-first degree of north latitude to a point formed by its intersection with the twenty-seventh degree of longitude west from Washington; thence north along said twenty-seventh degree of west longitude to a point formed by its intersection with the forty-third degree of north latitude; thence east along said forty-third degree of north latitude to the Reya Paha river; thence down the middle of the channel of said river, with its meanderings to its junction with the Niobrara river; thence down the middle of the channel of said Niobrara river, and following the meanderings thereof, to its junction with the Missouri river; thence down the middle of the channel of said Missouri river, and following the meander ings thereof to the place of beginning.' 13 Stat. at L. 47, chap. 59.\n Messrs. Edward C. Crow and Sam B. Jeffries for the State of Missouri.\n\n\n[196 U.S. 23, 32]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank N. Prout and W. H. Kelligar for state of Nebraska. \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is undisputed in the case that prior to July 5th, 1867, the bed and channel of the Missouri river were substantially as they had been continuously from the date of the admission of \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 34]\n\u00a0\n the respective states into the Union, only such variations occurring during that entire period as naturally followed in the course of time from one side of the river to the other. But on the day just named, July 5th, 1867 (which was after the admission of Nebraska into the Union), within twenty-four hours, and during a time of very high water, the river, which had for years passed around what is called McKissick's island, cut a new channel across and through the narrow neck of land at the west end of Island Precinct (of which McKissick's island formed a part), about a half mile wide, making for itself a new channel, and passing through what was admittedly, at that time, territory of Nebraska. After that change the river ceased to run around McKissick's island. In the course of a few years, after the new channel was thus made, the old channel dried up and became tillable land, valuable for agricultural purposes, whereby the old bed of the river was vacated about 15 miles in length. This change in the bed or channel of the river became fixed and permanent; for, at the commencement of this suit it was the same as it was immediately after the change that occurred on the 5th day of July, 1867. The result was that the land between the channel of the river as it was prior to July 5th, 1867, and the channel as it was after that date and is now, was thrown on the east side of the Missouri river; whereas, prior to that date it had been on the west side.\n The fundamental question in the case is whether the sudden and permanent change in the course and channel of the river, occurring on the 5th day of July, 1867, worked a change in the boundary line between the two states.\n The former decisions of this court relating to boundary lines between states seem to make this case easy of solution.\n In New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, 717, 9 L. ed. 573, 594, argued elaborately by eminent lawyers, Mr. Webster among the number, this court said: 'The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial forma- \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 35]\n\u00a0\n tions, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil. No other rule can be applied on just principles. Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss by the same means which may add to his territory; and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.' It was added-what is pertinent to the present case-that 'this rule is no less just when applied to public than to private rights.' The subject was under consideration in Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 Wall. 395, 20 L. ed. 116, and Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 U.S. 479\n, 34 L. ed. 329, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1051. But it again came under consideration in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 361\n, 367 S., 370, 36 L. ed. 186, 187, 190, 191, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396, 398, 400. In the latter case, the court, after referring to the rule announced in New Orleans v. United States, and citing prior cases in which that rule had been recognized, said: 'It is equally well settled that where a stream which is a boundary, from any cause suddenly abandons its old and seeks a new bed, such change of channel works no change of boundary; and that the boundary remains as it was, in the center of the old channel, although no water may be flowing therein. This sudden and rapid change of channel is termed, in the law, avulsion. In Gould, Waters,  159, it is said: 'But if the change is violent and visible, and arises from a known cause, such as a freshet, or a cut through which a new channel is formed, the original thread of the stream continues to mark the limits of the two estates.' 2 Bl. Com. 262; Angell, Watercourses,  60; Hopkins Academy v. Dickinson, 9 Cush. 544; Buttenuth v. St. Louis Bridge Co. 123 Ill. 535, 5 Am. St. Rep. 545, 17 N. E. 439; Hagan v. Campbell, 8 Port. (Ala.) 9, 33 Am. Dec. 267; Den ex dem. Murry v. Sermon, 8 N. C. (1 Hawks) 56. These propositions, which are universally recognized as correct where the boundaries of private property touch on streams, are in like manner recognized where the boundaries between states or nations are, by prescription or treaty, found in running water. Accretion, no matter to which side it adds ground, leaves the boundary still the center of the channel. Avulsion has no effect on boundary, but leaves it in the center \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 36]\n\u00a0\n of the old channel.' Again, in the same case, the court, referring to the very full examination of the authorities to be found in one of the opinions of Attorney General Cushing (8 Ops. Atty. Gen. 175), said: 'The result of these authorities puts it beyond doubt that accretion on an ordinary river would leave the boundary between two states the varying center of the channel, and that avulsion would establish a fixed boundary; to wit, the center of the abandoned channel. It is contended, however, that the doctrine of accretion has no application to the Missouri river, on account of the rapid and great changes constantly going on in respect to its banks; but the contrary has already been decided by this court in Jeffries v. East Omaha Land Co. \n134 \nU.S. 178, 189\n, 33 S. L. ed. 872, 876, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518.' In Nebraska v. Iowa, it appeared that the Missouri river near the land there in dispute had pursued a course in the nature of an ox-bow, but it suddenly cut through the neck of the bow and made for itself a new channel. The court said: 'This does not come within the law of accretion, but that of avulsion. By this selection of a new channel the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion,- the center line of the old channel; and that, unless the waters of the river returned to their former bed, became a fixed and unvarying boundary, no matter what might be the changes of the river in its new channel.'\n Manifestly, these observations cover the present case and make it clear that the boundary line between Missouri and Nebraska in the vicinity of Island Precinct cannot be taken to be the middle of the channel of the Missouri river, as it has been since the avulsion of 1867 and now is, but must be taken to be the middle of the channel of the river as it was prior to such avulsion. We cannot see that there are any facts or circumstances that withdraw the present case from the rule established in former adjudications.\n Counsel for Missouri contend that the act admitting Missouri into the Union, the memorial sent by the legislature of that state to Congress in 1831, and the act of June 7, 1836, with the \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 37]\n\u00a0\n proclamation of the President as to the extinguishment of Indian titles to lands between Missouri, as originally bounded, and the Missouri river, show that Congress intended that, so far as the boundary of the state of Missouri was concerned, the middle of the channel of the Missouri river, wherever it may be at any particular time,-and regardless of any changes, however caused or however extended, or permanent, suddenly occurring in its course or channel,-was to be taken as a perpetual, natural monument, fixing the boundary line. We cannot accept this view. We perceive no reason to believe that Congress intended, either by the acts of 1820 and 1836 relating to Missouri, or the act admitting Nebraska into the Union, to alter the recognized rules of law which fix the rights of parties where a river changes its course by gradual, insensible accretions, or the rules that obtain in cases where, by what is called avulsion, the course of a river is materially and permanently changed. Missouri does not dispute the fact that when Nebraska was admitted into the Union the body of land described in the present record as Island Precinct was in Nebraska. It is equally clear that those lands did not cease to be within the limits of Nebraska by reason of the avulsion of July 5th, 1867\n\n\n For the reasons stated we adjudge, in respect of the matters involved in this suit, that the middle of the channel of the Missouri river, according to its course as it was prior to the avulsion of July 5th, 1867, is the true boundary line between Missouri and Nebraska. Accordingly, the original bill must be dismissed, and a decree entered in favor of the state of Nebraska on its cross bill.\n It appears from the record that about the year 1895 the county surveyors of Nemaha county, Nebraska, and Atchison county, Missouri, made surveys of the abandoned bed of the Missouri river, in the locality here in question, ascertained the location of the original banks of the river on either side, and, to some extent, marked the middle of the old channel. If the two states agree upon these surveys and locations as correctly \n\n[196 U.S. 23, 38]\n\u00a0\n marking the original banks of the river and the middle of the old channel, the court will, by decree, give effect to that agreement; or, if either state desires a new survey the court will order one to be made, and cause monuments to be placed so as to permanently mark the boundary line between the two states. The disposition of the case by final decree is postponed for forty days, in order that the court may be advised as to the wishes of the parties in respect of these details. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OHIO EX REL LLOYD v.

We omit the allegations, as the supreme court of the state decided against their sufficiency, and its judgment is not open to our review.\n Wherein the law offends the Constitution of the United States was expressed as follows:\n'It contravenes  1, article 14, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it denies to this defendant and other persons within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law; it deprives said defendant and other citizens of their liberty and property without due process of law; it contravenes article 5 of the Constitution of the United States; it contravenes article 6 of the Constitution of the United States, in that the accused cannot enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial \n\n[194 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime is and shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, in this, to wit: that said jury cannot be selected by any previously enacted law from the territorial district, to wit, of the city of Cambridge, which district, and within which district alone, said crime, if any, is, was, and could have been committed.'\n\n All of these objections, however, are not open to the plaintiff in error to make. It is well established that the first eight articles of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States have reference to powers exercised by the government of the United States, and not to those of the states. Ellenbecker v. District Court, \n134 U.S. 31\n, 33 L. ed. 801, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424. Our consideration, therefore, must be confined to the contentions under the 14th Amendment. Those contentions are that the Ohio statute denies plaintiff in error the equal protection of the law, and deprives him of liberty and property without due process of law.\n The first contention can only be sustained if the statute treat plaintiff in error differently from what it does others who are in the same situation as he,-that is, in the same relation to the purpose of the statute. The statute is too long to quote at length. It is a local option law. It permits the municipal corporations of the state to prohibit 'the selling, furnishing, and giving away of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or the keeping of a place where such liquors are sold, kept for sale, given away, or furnished.' It excepts druggists in certain cases, and manufacturers when selling in wholesale quantities to 'bona fide dealers trafficking in intoxicating liquors, or in wholesale quantities to any party residing outside of the limits of said municipality.' What constitutes a 'giving away' is expressed in the statute as follows: 'The words, 'giving away,' where they occur in this act, shall not apply to the giving away of intoxicating liquors by a person in his private dwelling, unless such private dwelling is a place of \n\n[194 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n public resort.' By a subsequent statute it was enacted that each railway corporation which shall maintain or conduct dining or buffet cars upon any one of its trains, and shall desire to dispense intoxicating liquors on such cars, may do so by obtaining a license from the state, upon the payment of $300 or $700, accordingly as the corporation operates either 200 or 700 miles of railway within the state. It is not clear whether plaintiff in error relies on that act as a part of the other, and an addition to its discriminations. Assuming him to do so, the exceptions in the statute are druggists, manufacturers, persons who give away liquors in their private dwellings, and railway corporations dispensing liquors in dining and buffet cars, under state license.\n These exceptions constitute the inequalities of the statute upon which plaintiff in error bases his contention. He is not one of the excepted classes. He is a retail dealer of liquor; maybe a saloon keeper, but of that the record does not clearly inform us. If, between his occupation and the excepted occupation, there is such difference as to justify a difference of legislation, necessarily he cannot complain; and, we think, there is a manifest difference. It is equally manifest if we should regard him as 'giving away' his liquor. That act may not have the same objectionable consequences when done in a private dwelling as when done in a saloon or other place of business. The state may look beyond the mere physical passing of liquor from one person to another, and regard and constitute the place where it is done the essence of the offense. But even if the discriminations of the statute were less obviously justifiable, we might not be able to condemn them. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 267\n, ante, 638, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638.\n Plaintiff in error further urges that to make an act a crime in certain territory and permit it outside of such territory is to deny to the citizens of the state the equal operation of the criminal laws; and this he charges against, and makes a ground of objection to, the Ohio statute. This objection goes to the power of the state to pass a local option law; which, we think \n\n[194 U.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n is not an open question. The power of the state over the liquor traffic we have had occasion very recently to decide. We said, affirming prior cases, the sale of liquor by retail may be absolutely prohibited by a state. Cronin v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 108\n, ante, p. 219, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 219. That being so, the power to prohibit it conditionally was asserted, and the local option law of the state of Texas was sustained. Rippey v. Texas, \n193 U.S. 504\n, ante, p. 516, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516.\n The next contention of plaintiff in error is that under the statute he is not on equal terms with all others accused of crime. He attempts to support this contention by a provision of the Constitution of Ohio, and a decision of the supreme court of that state. By the Constitution of the state those charged with crimes are guaranteed 'a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.' The supreme court, considering this provision, said in Cooper v. State, 16 Ohio St. 328:\n'The right of the accused to an impartial jury cannot be abridged. To secure this right it is necessary that the body of triers should be composed of men indifferent between the parties, and otherwise capable of discharging their duty as jurors. . . . This duty is enjoined by the Constitution, and, it is true, cannot be impaired, or the right abridged by legislative action.'\n\n Applying the Constitution and the decision, plaintiff in error asserts that the district in which his offense was committed was necessarily the area of the operation of the statute, and it is only jurors selected from such district that will be indifferent between the state and him. It is only such jurors, he urges, that are his peers; and he defines a peer to be one 'capable of committing a like crime, and suffering a like punishment, and liable to a like disgrace.'\n There are two answers to the contention. First, it must be inferred from the decision of the supreme court in the case at bar that plaintiff in error does not construe correctly either the Constitution of the state or the opinion he cites. Second, \n\n[194 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff in error has not yet been tried. What the courts of the state may decide as to juries we do not wish to anticipate; and plaintiff in error cannot complain until he is made to suffer.\n The final contention of plaintiff in error is that the statute of Ohio deprives him of due process of law. The only additional argument advanced on this contention is that the statute does not define the words 'wholesale' and 'retail,' and fails to limit the amount of the fine or penalty to be imposed by the court. This omission of the general assembly, it is said, vests legislative power in the judiciary, which cannot be done in a republican form of government.\n Of this contention we need only observe that if a case can exist in which the kind or degree of power given by a state to its tribunals may become an element of due process under the 14th Amendment, it would have to be a more extreme example than the Ohio statute. Wholesale and retail are pretty well known terms, and present less uncertainties than many terms submitted to courts for interpretation. Besides, would it not be strange to hold that a statute unaccompanied by a glossary of its terms leaves unfulfilled the legislative power?\n The statute declares a person guilty of a violation of its provisions to be guilty of a misdemeanor, and imposes a penalty for a first and second offense, a maximum and minimum fine, and for any subsequent offense a fine of not less than $200 and imprisonment of not more than sixty days and not less than ten days. Ohio Rev. Stat.  4364-20b. As we understand the argument of plaintiff in error, his objection is directed to the penalty for the third and subsequent offenses. We might dispose of the objection by saying it anticipates the future too much. He is not now concerned with that penalty. He has not yet been convicted of a first offense, as far as the record shows. Indeed, the charge against him presumably is based on his first offense. But considering him entitled to make the objection, we may answer \n\n[194 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n it and close the discussion by observing that it is not an extreme discretion to commit to the judgment of a court, in the manner provided by the Ohio statute, the amount of punishment to fix for illegal liquor selling.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA v. STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA(1904)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 286, 287]\n\u00a0\n By an act passed in 1849 (chap. 82, Laws 1848-49), the North Carolina Railroad Company was chartered by the state of North Carolina with a capital of $3,000,000, divided into 30,000 shares of $100 each. The state subscribed for 20,000 shares. The statute authorized the borrowing of money to pay the state subscription, and pledged as security therefor the stock of the railroad company held by the state. In 1855 a further subscription for 10,000 shares was authorized by statute (chap. 32, Laws 1854-55), to be issued on the same terms and with the same security. At the same session an act was passed incorporating the Western North Carolina Railroad Company (chap. 228, Laws 1854-55), which authorized a subscription by the state and the issue of bonds secured by the stock held by the state in said company. On December 19, 1866, a further act was passed (chap. 106, Laws 1866-67), entitled 'An Act to Enhance the Value of the Bonds to be Issued for the Completion of the Western North Carolina Railroad, and for Other Purposes,' which, after referring to the prior acts of the state authorizing the issue of bonds, and stating that a portion of them had already been issued, added:\n'And, whereas, it is manifestly the interest of the people of the whole state that the residue of the bonds, when issued, shall command a high price in market; therefore,\n\n'Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of North Carolina, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 288]\n\u00a0\n same, That the public treasurer be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed, whenever it shall become his duty under the provisions of said acts, passed at the sessions of 1854-55 and 1860-61, to issue bonds of the state to the amount of $50,000 or more, to mortgage an equal amount of the stock which the state now holds in the North Carolina Railroad, as collateral security for the payment of said bonds, and to execute and deliver, with each several bond, a deed of mortgage for an equal amount of stock to said North Carolina Railroad, said mortgage to be signed by the treasurer and countersigned by the comptroller, to constitute a part of said bond, and to be transferable in like manner with it, as provided in the charter of said Western North Carolina Railroad Company; and, further, that such mortgages shall have all the force and effect, in law and equity, of registered mortgages without actual registry.'\n\n Under this last act bonds were issued in the sum of $1,000 each, having this indorsement:\n State of North Carolina,\n Treasury Department.\n Raleigh, July 1, 1867.\n Under the provisions of an act of the general assembly of North Carolina, entitled 'An Act to Enhance the Value of the Bonds to be Issued for the Completion of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, and for Other Purposes,' ratified 19th December, 1866, ten shares of the stock in the North Carolina Railroad Company, originally subscribed for by the state, are hereby mortgaged as collateral security for the payment of this bond.\n Witness the signature of the public treasurer and seal of office, and the countersignature of the comptroller.\n Kemp P. Battle,\n Public Treasurer.\n S. W. Burgin, Comptroller.\n These bonds ran thirty years, and became due in 1897. In 1879 the state of North Carolina appointed commissioners to adjust and compromise the state debt, and all of the last-men- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 289]\n\u00a0\n tioned bonds have been compromised with the exception of about $250,000. Simon Schafer and Samuel M. Schafer, either individually or as partners, owned a large proportion of these outstanding bonds, having held them for about thirty years. In 1901 Simon Schafer gave ten of these bonds to the state of South Dakota. The letter accompanying the gift was in these words: Office of Schafer Brothers, no. 35 Wall St.,\n New York, September 10th, 1901. Hon. Charles H. Burke.\n Dear Sir:--\n The undersigned, one of the members of the firm of Schafer Bros., has decided, after consultation with the other holders of the second-mortgage bonds issued by the state of North Carolina, to donate ten of these bonds to the state of South Dakota.\n The holders of these bonds have waited for some thirty years in the hope that the state of North Carolina would realize the justice of their claims for the payment of these bonds.\n The bonds are all now about due, beside, of course, the coupons, which amount to some 170 per cent of the face of the bond.\n The holders of these bonds have been advised that they cannot maintain a suit against the state of North Carolina on these bonds, but that such a suit can be maintained by a foreign state or by one of the United States.\n The owners of these bonds are mostly, if not entirely, persons who liberally give charity to the needy, the deserving, and the unfortunate.\n These bonds can be used to great advantage by states or foreign governments; and the majority owners would prefer to use them in this way rather than take the trifle which is offered by the debtor.\n If your state should succeed in collecting these bonds it would be the inclination of the owners of a majority of the total issue now outstanding to make additional donations to such \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n governments as may be able to collect from the repudiating state, rather than accept the small pittance offered in settlement.\n The donors of these ten bonds would be pleased if the legislature of South Dakota should apply the proceeds of these bonds to the state university or to some of its asylums or other charities.\n Very respectfully,\n Simon Schafer.\n Prior thereto, and on March 11, 1901, the state of South Dakota had passed the following act (Session Laws South Dakota, chap. 134, p. 227):\n An Act to Require the Acceptance and Collections of Grants, Devises, Bequests, Donations, and Assignments to the State of South Dakota.\n Be it enacted by the legislature of South Dakota:\n Sec. 1. That whenever any grant, devise, bequest, donation, or gift or assignment of money, bonds, or choses in action, or of any property, real or personal, shall be made to this state, the governor is hereby directed to receive and accept the same, so that the right and title to the same shall pass to this state; and all such bonds, notes, or choses in action, or the proceeds thereof when collected, and all other property or thing of value, so received by the state as aforesaid shall be reported by the governor to the legislature, to the end that the same may be covered into the public treasury or appropriated to the state university or to the public schools, or to state charities, as may hereafter be directed by law.\n Sec. 2. Whenever it shall be necessary to protect or assert the right or title of the state to any property so received or derived as aforesaid, or to collect or to reduce into possession any bond, note, bill, or chose in action, the attorney general is directed to take the necessary and proper proceedings and to bring suit in the name of the state in any court of competent jurisdiction, state or Federal, and to prosecute all such suits, and is author- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 291]\n\u00a0\n ized to employ counsel to be associated with him in such suits or actions, who, with him, shall fully represent the state, and shall be entitled to reasonable compensation out of the recoveries and collections in such suits and actions.\n This act was passed on the suggestion that perhaps a donation of bonds of southern states would be made to the state. On November 18, 1901, the state of South Dakota, leave having been first obtained, filed in this court its bill of complaint, making defendants the state of North Carolina, Simon Rothschilds (alleged to be one of the holders and owners of the bonds originally issued by the state and secured by a pledge of the stock in the North Carolina Railroad Company under the acts of 1849 and 1855), and Charles Salter (alleged to be one of the holders of the bonds issued under the act of 1855 and 1866, on account of the subscription to the Western North Carolina Railroad Company), the two individuals being made defendants as representatives of the classes of bondholders to which they severally belong. In it the plaintiff, after setting forth the facts in reference to the several issues of bonds and its acquisition of title to ten, prayed that an account might be taken of all the bonds issued by virtue of these statutes; that North Carolina be required to pay the amount found due on the bonds held by the plaintiff, and that in default of payment North Carolina and all persons claiming under said state might be barred and foreclosed of all equity and right of redemption in and to the 30,000 shares of stock held by the state, and that these shares, or as many thereof as might be necessary to pay off and discharge the entire mortgage indebtedness, be sold, and the proceeds, after payment of costs, be applied in satisfaction of the bonds and coupons secured by such mortgages; and also for a receiver and an injunction.\n Defendant Rothschilds made no answer. On April 2, 1902 the state of North Carolina and the defendant Charles Salter, filed separate answers. North Carolina in its answer denied both the jurisdiction of this court and the title of the plaintiff; averred that the bonds were not issued in conformity with the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 292]\n\u00a0\n statute; admitted the ownership of 30,000 shares of stock; denied that the mortgages were properly executed or that they had the effect of conveyances or transfers, either in law or equity, of said stock, or conferred any lien by way of pledge or otherwise upon the same; denied that she ever had any compact or agreement whatever other than that contained in the Constitution of the United States with South Dakota, or that South Dakota had ever informed North Carolina of any claim against her, or made any demand in respect to it, or any effort to settle or accommodate. Salter's answer was mainly an admission of the allegations of the bill, with a claim that all the stock should be sold in satisfaction of the mortgage bonds of which he was charged to be the representative. Testimony was taken under direction of the court, before commissioners agreed upon by the parties.\n Messrs. Wheeler H. Peckham and R. W. Stewart for complainant.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 286, 297]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Rountree, James E. Shepherd, Robert D. Gilmer, and James H. Merrimon for the state of North Carolina.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 286, 308]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Daniel L. Russell, Alfred Russell, and Marion Butler for defendant Salter.\n Mr. Frederic D. McKenney for defendant Rothschilds.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 309]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n There can be no reasonable doubt of the validity of the bonds and mortgages in controversy. There is no challenge of the statutes by which they were authorized. By those statutes the treasurer was directed when it became necessary to borrow money for the payment of the subscription, to prepare coupon bonds and advertise in one or more newspapers for sealed proposals, and to accept the terms offered most advantageous to the state, provided that in no event should the bonds be sold for less than their par value. The advertisement was made, no bids were received, but the bonds were delivered to the railroad company as payment for the subscription, dollar for dollar. Upon each bond was placed the statutory pledge or mortgage. It is true no money was paid into the treasury and thence out of the treasury to the railroad company, yet, looking at the substance of the transaction (and equity has regard to substance rather than form), the transaction was the same as though the company had been the only bidder, had placed a thousand dollars in the treasury in payment of each bond, and received that thousand dollars back from the treasury in payment of the subscription for ten shares of stock. It is true also that there was no formal issue of certificates by the company to the state, but that was a matter of arrangement between the parties to the subscription. The state's right as a stockholder was not abridged by lack of the certificates, and in fact it has been receiving dividends on the stock exactly as though certificates had been issued. The statute also provided that with each several bond a deed of mortgage for an equal amount of stock, signed by the treasurer and countersigned by the comptroller, should constitute a part of the bond and be transferable in like manner with it, 'and further, that such mortgage shall have all the force and effect, \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 310]\n\u00a0\n in law and equity, of registered mortgages without actual registry.' While no certificate of stock was to be attached to or go with the bond, the statute evidently contemplated that the mortgage endorsed on the bond should have the same force and effect. Hence, when the indorsement was made and the bond issued by the state, it was tantamount to a spearation and identification of the number of shares named therein. It cannot be that the state, having provided this means of giving to each bond the mortgage security of the corresponding shares of stock, can now prevent the attaching of the lien on the ground that no shares had been separated and no certificate transferred. It is unnecessary to refer to chap. 98 of the Laws of 1879, for that act was one in the nature of an offer to compromise, although it does contain a recognition of outstanding obligations.\n Neither can there be any question respecting the title of South Dakota to these bonds. They are not held by the state as representative of individual owners, as in the case of New Hampshire v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 27 L. ed. 656, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176, for they were given outright and absolutely to the state. It is true that the gift may be considered a rare and unexpected one. Apparently the statute of South Dakota was passed in view of the expected gift, and probably the donor made the gift under a not unreasonable expectation that South Dakota would bring an action against North Carolina to enforce these bonds, and that such action might enure to his benefit as the owner of other like bonds. But the motive with which a gift is made, whether good or bad, does not affect its validity or the question of jurisdiction. This has been often ruled. In M'Donald v. Smalley, 1 Pet. 620, 7 L. ed. 287, an objection to the jurisdiction on the ground that the title to the property in controversy had been conveyed to the plaintiff in the belief that it would be sustained by the Federal, when it would not be by the state, court, was overruled, with this observation by Chief Justice Marshall (p. 624, L. ed. p. 289):\n'This testimony, which is all that was laid before the court, shows, we think, a sale and conveyance to the plaintiff which was binding on both parties. M'Donald could not have main- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 311]\n\u00a0\n tained an action for his debt, nor M'Arthur a suit for his land. His title to it was extinguished, and the consideration was received. The motives which induced him to make the contract, whether justifiable or consurable, can have no influence on its validity. They were such as had sufficient influence with himself, and he had a right to act upon them. A court cannot enter into them when deciding on its jurisdiction. The conveyance appears to be a real transaction, and the real as well as nominal parties to the suit are citizens of different states.'\n\n See also Smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198, 12 L. ed. 666; Barney v. Baltimore City, 6 Wall. 280, 18 L. ed. 825; Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co. \n176 U.S. 181\n, 190-192, 44 L. ed. 423, 430, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 311. In this last case Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court, said:\n'If the law concerned itself with the motives of parties, new complications would be introduced into suits, which might seriously obscure their real merits. If the debt secured by a mortgage be justly due, it is no defense to a foreclosure that the mortgagee was animated by hostility or other bad motive. Davis v. Flagg, 35 N. J. Eq. 491; Dering v. Winchelsea, 1 Cox. Ch. Cas. 318; McMullen v. Ritchie, 64 Fed. 253, 261; Toler v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. 67 Fed. 168. . . . The reports of this court furnish a number of analogous cases. Thus, it is well settled that a mere colorable conveyance of property, for the purpose of vesting title in a nonresident and enabling him to bring suit in a Federal court, will not confer jurisdiction; but if the conveyance appear to be a real transaction, the court will not, in deciding upon the question of jurisdiction, inquire into the motives which actuated the parties in making the conveyance. M'Donald v. Smalley, 1 Pet. 620, 7 L. ed. 287; Smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198, 12 L. ed. 666; Barney v. Baltimore City, 6 Wall. 280, 18 L. ed. 825; Farmington v. Pillsbury, \n114 U.S. 138\n, 29 L. ed. 114, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 807; Crawford v. Neal, \n144 U.S. 585\n, 36 L. ed. 552, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 759.\n\n'The law is equally well settled that, if a person take up a bona fide residence in another state, he may sue in a Federal court, notwithstanding his purpose was to resort to a forum of which he could not have availed himself if he were a resident of the state in which the court was held. Cheever v. \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 312]\n\u00a0\n Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 123, 19 L. ed. 604, 608; Briggs v. French, 2 Sumn. 251, Fed. Cas. No. 1,871; Catlett v. Pacific Ins. Co. 1 Paine, 594, Fed. Cas. No. 2,517; Cooper v. Galbraith, 3 Wash. 546, Fed. Cas. No. 3,193; Johnson v. Monell, Woolw. 390, Fed. Cas. No. 7,399.'\n\n The title of South Dakota is as perfect as though it had received these bonds directly from North Carolina. We have, therefore, before us the case of a state with an unquestionable title to bonds issued by another state, secured by a mortgage of railroad stock belonging to that state, coming into this court and invoking its jurisdiction to compel payment of those bonds and a subjection of the mortgaged property to the satisfaction of the debt.\n Has this court jurisdiction of such a controversy, and to what extent may it grant relief? Obviously, that jurisdiction is not affected by the fact that the donor of these bonds could not invoke it. The payee of a foreign bill of exchange may not sue the drawer in the Federal court of a state of which both are citizens, but that does not oust the court of jurisdiction of an action by a subsequent holder if the latter be a citizen of another state. The question of jurisdiction is determined by the status of the present parties, and not by that of prior holders of the thing in controversy. Obviously, too, the subject-matter is one of judicial cognizance. If anything can be considered as justiciable it is a claim for money due on a written promise to pay; and if it be justiciable, does it matter how the plaintiff acquires title, providing it be honestly acquired? It would seem strangely inconsistent to take jurisdiction of an action by South Dakota against North Carolina on a promise to pay made by the latter directly to the former, and refuse jurisdiction of an action on a like promise made by the latter to an individual, and by him sold or donated to the former.\n A preliminary question arises from the fact that representatives of the two classes of bonds are made defendants, and that a part of the relief asked is a sale of the 30,000 shares of stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company, belonging to the state of North Carolina, in satisfaction and discharge of all the mortgages upon such stock. It is insisted \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 313]\n\u00a0\n that these individuals, owners of the bonds, although named as defendants, are in fact occupying an adverse position to that of the state, and that the effect of their presence as parties is a practical nullification of the 11th Amendment, in that it is giving to individuals relief by judgment against the state. Apparently, one expectation of the donor to South Dakota was that in some way the bonds retained by himself would be placed in judgment, and relief obtained against North Carolina in the suit commenced by South Dakota. But we think that these individuals are not necessary parties-defendant, and that no relief should be given to them or to the classes of bondholders they represent. The statute under which the mortgage was executed provided that with each of the bonds a deed of mortgage for a like amount of stock should be executed by the state. There is, therefore, a separate mortgage of ten shares of stock on each one of these bonds, and that mortgage can be fully satisfied by a decree of foreclosure and sale of the ten shares of stock. No one would doubt that, if a certificate of stock was attached as a pledge to a note, the pledge could be satisfied by a sale of the stock without any determination of the rights of the purchaser as between himself and other stockholders. And such was the manifest purpose of this legislation. It contemplated that each bondholder should receive a stock security which he could realize on without the delay and expense of a suit to which all other stockholders and the corporation would be necessary parties. The purchaser at the sale to be authorized by this decree will become vested with the full title of the state to the number of shares of stock stated in the mortgage. He will occupy the same position in relation to the corporate property that other stockholders occupy, and have whatever rights they have. It is not necessary for a full satisfaction of the mortgage on one of these bonds that any other mortgage upon another bond be also foreclosed, or that a decree be entered determining what rights the purchaser will have by virtue of the stock which he obtains at the sale. So far, then, as these individual defend- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 314]\n\u00a0\n ants are concerned, the suit will be dismissed, with costs against South Dakota.\n Coming now to the right of South Dakota to maintain this suit against North Carolina, we remark that it is a controversy between two states; that by  2, art. III., of the Constitution, this court is given original jurisdiction of 'controversies between two or more states.' In Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 45 L. ed. 497, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, Mr. Justice Shiras, speaking for the court, reviewed at length the history of the incorporation of this provision into the Federal Constitution, and the decisions rendered by this court in respect to such jurisdiction, closing with these words (p. 240, L. ed. p. 512, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 343):\n'The cases cited show that such jurisdiction has been exercised in cases involving boundaries and jurisdiction over lands and their inhabitants, and in cases directly affecting the property rights and interests of a state.'\n\n The present case is one 'directly affecting the property rights and interests of a state.'\n Although a repetition of this review is unnecessary, two or three matters are worthy of notice. The original draft of the Constitution reported to the convention gave to the Sanate jurisdiction of all disputes and controversies 'between two or more states, respecting jurisdiction or territory,' and to the Supreme Court jurisdiction of 'controversies between two or more states, except such as shall regard territory or jurisdiction.' A claim for money due being a controversy of a justiciable nature, and one of the most common of controversies, would seem to naturally fall within the scope of the jurisdiction thus intended to be conferred upon the Supreme Court. In the subsequent revision by the convention the power given to the Senate in respect to controversies between the states was stricken out, as well as the limitation upon the jurisdiction of this court, leaving to it, in the language now found in the Constitution, jurisdiction, without any limitation, of 'controversies between two or more states.'\n The Constitution, as it originally stood, also gave to this \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 315]\n\u00a0\n court jurisdiction of controversies 'between a state and citizens of another state.' Under that clause Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L. ed. 440, was decided, in which it was held that a citizen of one state might maintain in this court an action of assumpsit against another state. In consequence of that decision the 11th Amendment was adopted, which provides that 'the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.' It will be perceived that this amendment only granted to a state immunity from suit by an individual, and did not affect the jurisdiction over controversies between two or more states. In respect to this it was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406, 5 L. ed. 257, 291:\n'It is a part of our history that, at the adoption of the Constitution, all the states were greatly indebted; and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted; and the court maintained its jurisdiction. The alarm was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the state legislatures. That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty of a state from the degradation supposed to attend a compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the nation may be inferred from the terms of the amendment. It does not comprehend controversies between two or more states, or between a state and a foreign state. The jurisdiction of the court still extends to these cases; and in these a state may still be sued. We must ascribe the amendment, then, to some other cause than the dignity of a state. There is no difficulty in finding this cause. Those who were inhibited from commencing a suit against a state, or from prosecuting one which might be commenced before the adoption of the amendment, were persons who might probably be its creditors. There was not much reason to fear that foreign or sister states would \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 316]\n\u00a0\n be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason to retain the jurisdiction of the court in those cases, because it might be essential to the preservation of peace. The amendment, therefore, extended to suits commenced or prosecuted by individuals, but not to those brought by states.'\n\n In the same case, after referring to the two classes of cases, jurisdiction of which was vested in the courts of the Union, he said (p. 378, L. ed. p. 285):\n'In the second class, the jurisdiction depends entirely on the character of the parties. In this are comprehended 'controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state,' 'and between a state and foreign states, citizens or subjects.' If these be the parties, it is entirely unimportant what may be the subject of controversy. Be it what it may, these parties have a constitutional right to come into the courts of the Union.'\n\n In Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 9 L. ed. 1233, this court sustained its jurisdiction of a suit in equity brought by one state against another to determine a dispute as to boundary, and, in the course of the opinion, by Mr. Justice Baldwin, said in respect to the immunity of a sovereign from suit by an individual (p. 720, L. ed. p. 1259):\n'Those states, in their highest sovereign capacity, in the convention of the people thereof, . . . adopted the Constitution, by which they respectively made to the United States a grant of judicial power over controversies between two or more states. By the Constitution, it was ordained that this judicial power, in cases where a state was a party, should be exercised by this court as one of original jurisdiction. The states waived their exemption from judicial power (6 Wheat. 378, 380, 5 L. ed. 284, 285) as sovereigns by original and inherent right, by their own grant of its exercise over themselves in such cases, but which they would not grant to any inferior tribunal. By this grant, this court has acquired jurisdiction over the parties in this cause, by their own consent and delegated authority; as their agent for executing the judicial power of the United States in the cases specified.'\n\n And, again, in reference to the extent of the jurisdiction of this court (p. 721, L. ed. p. 1259): \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 317]\n\u00a0\n 'That it is a controversy between two states cannot be denied; and, though the Constitution does not, in terms, extend the judicial power to all controversies between two or more states, yet it, in terms, excludes none, whatever may be their nature or subject.'\n In United States v. North Carolina, \n136 U.S. 211\n, 34 L. ed. 336, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 920, we took jurisdiction of an action brought by the United States against North Carolina to recover interest on bonds, and decided the case upon its merits. It is true there was nothing in the opinion in reference to the matter of jurisdiction, but as said in United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621, 642\n, 36 S. L. ed. 285, 292, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488, 492:\n'The cases in this court show that the framers of the Constitution did provide, by that instrument, for the judicial determination of all cases in law and equity between two or more states, including those involving questions of boundary. Did they omit to provide for the judicial determination of controversies arising between the United States and one or more of the states of the Union? This question is in effect answered by United States v. North Carolina, \n136 U.S. 211\n, 34 L. ed. 336, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 920. That was an action of debt brought in this court by the United States against the state of North Carolina upon certain bonds issued by that state. The state appeared, the case was determined here upon its merits, and judgment was rendered for the state. It is true that no question was made as to the jurisdiction of this court, and nothing was therefore said in the opinion upon that subject. But it did not escape the attention of the court, and the judgment would not have been rendered except upon the theory that this court has original jurisdiction of a suit by the United States against a state.'\n\n See also United States v. Michigan, \n190 U.S. 379\n, 47 L. ed. 1103, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742, decided at the last term, in which a bill in equity for an accounting and a recovery of money was sustained. Mr. Justice Peckham, delivering the unanimous opinion of the court, said (pp. 396, 406, L. ed. pp. 1109, 1113, Sup. Ct. Rep. pp. 747, 751):\n'By its bill the United States invokes the original jurisdiction of this court for the purpose of determining a controversy existing between it and the state of Michigan. This court has jurisdiction of such a controversy, although it is not lit- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 318]\n\u00a0\n erally between two states, the United States being a party on the one side and a state on the other. This was decided in United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621, 642\n, 36 S. L. ed. 285, 292, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488. . . . There must be judgment overruling the demurrer, but as the defendant may desire to set up facts which it might claim would be a defense to the complainant's bill, we grant leave to the defendant to answer up to the first day of the next term of this court. In case it refuses to plead further, the judgment will be in favor of the United States for an accounting for the payment of the sum found due thereon.'\n\n We are not unmindful of the fact that in Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 U.S. 1\n, 33 L. ed. 842, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504, Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court, expressed his concurrence in the views announced by Mr. Justice Iredell, in the dissenting opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, but such expression cannot be considered as a judgment of the court, for the point decided was that, construing the 11th Amendment according to its spirit rather than by its letter, a state was relieved from liability to suit at the instance of an indivdual, whether one of its own citizens or a citizen of a foreign state. Without noticing in detail the other cases referred to by Mr. Justice Shiras in Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 45 L. ed. 497, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, it is enough to say that the clear import of the decisions of this court from the beginning to the present time is in favor of its jurisdiction over an action brought by one state against another, to enforce a property right. Chisholm v. Georgia was an action of assumpsit; United States v. North Carolina, an action of debt; United States v. Michigan, a suit for an accounting; and that which was sought in each was a money judgment against the defendant state.\n But we are confronted with the contention that there is no power in this court to enforce such a judgment, and such lack of power is conclusive evidence that, notwithstanding the general language of the Constitution, there is an implied exception of actions brought to recover money. The public property held by any municipality, city, county, or state is exempt from seizure upon execution, because it is held by such corporation, not as a part of its private assets, but as a trustee for public purposes. (Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 \nU.S. 472, 513\n, 26 S. L. ed. 197, 204.) \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 319]\n\u00a0\n As a rule, no such municipality has any private property subject to be taken upon execution. A levy of taxes is not within the scope of the judicial power except as it commands an inferior municipality to execute the power granted by the legislature.\n In Rees v. Watertown, 19 Wall. 107, 116, 117, 22 L. ed. 72, 75, we said:\n'We are of the opinion that this court has not the power to direct a tax to be levied for the payment of these judgments. This power to impose burdens and raise money is the highest attribute of sovereignty, and is exercised, first, to raise money for public purposes only; and, second, by the power of legislative authority only. It is a power that has not been extended to the judiciary. Especially is it beyond the power of the Federal judiciary to assume the place of a state in the exercise of this authority, at once so delicate and so important.'\n\n See also Heine v. Levee Comrs. 19 Wall. 655, 661, 22 L. ed. 223, 226; Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 472\n, 26 L. ed. 197.\n In this connection reference may be made to United States ex rel. Goodrich v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, 15 L. ed. 102, in which an application was made for a mandamus against the Secretary of the Treasury to compel the payment of an official salary, and in which we said (p. 303, L. ed. p. 106):\n'The only legitimate inquiry for our determination upon the case before us is this: Whether, under the organization of the Federal government or by any known principle of law, there can be asserted a power in the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, or in this court, to command the withdrawal of a sum or sums of money from the Treasury of the United States, to be applied in satisfaction of disputed or controverted claims against the United States? This is the question, the very question presented for our determination; and its simple statement would seem to carry with it the most startling considerations,-nay, its unavoidable negation, unless this should be prevented by some positive and controlling command; for it would occur, a priori, to every mind, that a treasury, not fenced round or shielded by fixed and established modes and rules of administration, but which \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 320]\n\u00a0\n could be subjected to any number or description of demands, asserted and sustained through the undefined and undefinable discretion of the courts, would constitute a feeble and inadequate provision for the great and inevitable necessities of the nation. The government under such a regime, or rather, under such an absence of all rule, would, if practicable at all, be administered, not by the great departments ordained by the Constitution and laws, and guided by the modes therein prescribed, but by the uncertain and perhaps contradictory action of the courts, in the enforcement of their views of private interests.'\n\n Further, in this connection may be noticed Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, in which this court declined to take jurisdiction of an appeal from the court of claims, under the statute as it stood at the time of the decision, on the ground that there was not vested by the act of Congress power to enforce its judgment. We quote the following from the opinion, which was the last prepared by Chief Justice Taney (pp. 702, 704):\n'The award of execution is a part, and an essential part, of every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power. It is no judgment, in the legal sense of the term, without it. Without such an award the judgment would be inoperative and nugatory, leaving the aggrieved party without a remedy. . . . Indeed, no principle of constitutional law has been more firmly established or constantly adhered to than the one above stated,-that is, that this court has no jurisdiction in any case where it cannot render judgment in the legal sense of the term; and when it depends upon the legislature to carry its opinion into effect or not, at the pleasure of Congress.' See also Re Sanborn, \n148 U.S. 222\n, 37 L. ed. 429, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577, and La Abra Silver Min. Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423, 456\n, 44 S. L. ed. 223, 235, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168,\n\n We have, then, on the one hand the general language of the Constitution, vesting jurisdiction in this court over 'controversies between two or more states,' the history of that jurisdictional clause in the convention, the cases of Chisholm v. Georgia, United States v. North Carolina, and United States v. Michigan (in which this court sustained jurisdiction over actions \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 321]\n\u00a0\n to recover money from a state), the manifest trend of other decisions, the necessity of some way of ending controversies between states, and the fact that this claim for the payment of money is one justiciable in its nature; on the other, certain expression of individual opinions of justices of this court, the difficulty of enforcing a judgment for money against a state by reason of its ordinary lack of private property subject to seizure upon execution, and the absolute inability of a court to compel a levy of taxes by the legislature. Notwithstanding the embarrassments which surround the question, it is directly presented, and may have to be determined before the case is finally concluded, but for the present it is sufficient to state the question with its difficulties.\n There is in this case a mortgage of property, and the sale of that property under a foreclosure may satisfy the plaintiff's claim. If that should be the result, there would be no necessity for a personal judgment against the state. That the state is a necessary party to the foreclosure of the mortgage was settled by Christian v. Atlantic & N. C. R. Co. \n133 U.S. 233\n, 33 L. ed. 589, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260. Equity is satisfied by a decree for a foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property, leaving the question of a judgment over for any deficiency to be determined when, if ever, it arises. And surely if, as we have often held, this court has jurisdiction of an action by one state against another to recover a tract of land, there would seem to be no doubt of the jurisdiction of one to enforce the delivery of personal property.\n A decree will, therefore, be entered, which, after finding the amount due on the bonds and coupons in suit to be twenty-seven thousand four hundred dollars ($27,400), (no interest being recoverable [United States v. North Carolina, \n136 U.S. 211\n, 34 L. ed. 336, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 920]), and that the same are secured by 100 shares of the stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company, belonging to the state of North Carolina, shall order that the said state of North Carolina pay said amount with costs of suit to the state of South Dakota on or before the 1st Monday of January, 1905, and that in default of such payment an order of sale be issued to the marshal of this court, directing him to sell \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 322]\n\u00a0\n at public auction all the interest of the state of North Carolina in and to one hundred shares of the capital stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company, such sale to be made at the east front door of the Capitol building in this city, public notice to be given of such sale by advertisements once a week for six weeks in some daily paper published in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina, and also in some daily paper published in the city of Washington.\n And either of the parties to this suit may apply to the court upon the foot of this decree, as occasion may require.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting, with whom concurred Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, Mr. Justice McKenna, and Mr. Justice Day:\n The decision in this cause seems to me to disregard an express and absolute prohibition of the Constitution. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court. As, however, there are some facts deemed by me to be material, which are not referred to, it is proposed to make a summary of the case, and then express the reasons which control me.\n In the years 1847 and 1855 the negotiable bonds of the state of North Carolina were issued to aid in the construction of the railway of the North Carolina Railroad Company, and were exchanged for the stock of that company. The bonds went into the hands of individuals and the exchanged stock passed into the possession of the state, and was declared to be pledged in the hands of the state to secure the payment of the bonds in question.\n In 1855 and 1866 similar aid was given to another railway,-the Western North Carolina. Bonds, each for the par value of $1,000, aggregating nearly two and a half millions of dollars, were issued by the state. All the bonds which were issued after the passage, in 1866, of an act of the legislature, were declared to be secured, as stated in the act, by a mortgage of the stock of the North Carolina Railroad held by the state, and already, in its entirety, pledged for the security of all the bonds which had been previously issued \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 323]\n\u00a0\n in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. The stock, however, remained in possession of the state, but each of the bonds thereafter issued contained an indorsement that ten shares of stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company, in the hands of the state, were mortgaged as security for the payment of each of the bonds.\n Presumably, as a result of the disastrous consequences of the Civil War and the events which followed, the financial affairs of the state of North Carolina in 1879 were profoundly embarrassed. The state had not paid the interest as it accrued on the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. It had, in effect, paid no interest whatever on the bonds issued in favor of the Western North Carolina Railroad, and, indeed, had defaulted generally in the payment of the interest on its public debt. Statutes were passed by the state providing for an adjustment of its financial affairs so as to rehabilitate its credit, in order that when the state debt was readjusted the state might, for the benefit of all its people and its creditors, be able to pay the interest on, and provide for the principal of, the public debt. The adjustment made was accepted by those holding the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad, and they waived a very large sum of unpaid interest, and received new bonds, accompanied with a reiteration of the pledge of all the stock of the North Carolina Railroad owned by the state, which had always been held by the state as security for the payment of all the bonds of that issue. It is to be inferred from the record that the adjustment proposed was generally accepted by the other creditors of the state, and that, as a consequence, its fiscal affairs were placed upon a sound basis. Be this as it may, certain is it that the adjustment was accepted by the holders of a vast majority of the bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad, and that such holders surrendered their old bonds and took new bonds of the state for 25 per cent of the face value of their bonds, these new bonds not purporting to be secured by any mortgage of the stock of the North Carolina Railroad.\n In 1901,-twenty-two years after the passage of the acts re- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 324]\n\u00a0\n ferred to, and their acceptance as above stated,-Simon Schafer and his brother, composing the firm of Schafer & Brothers, bankers and brokers in the city of New York, addressed a petition to the legislature of North Carolina. Therein it was recited that the parties named were the holders, in their own right and as trustees, of nearly two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad Company, attached to which were unpaid interest coupons for more than thirty years. The petitioners declared that these bonds were substantially all the bonds of the series then outstanding, because the holders thereof had not accepted the arrangement of 1879. It was stated that such arrangements had been accepted by the vast majority of others who held such bonds, by reason of the financial stress of the state at the time, and because those creditors knew that the stock of the North Carolina Railroad, mortgaged to secure the bonds, was of no avail for such purpose, since its value at the time of the adjustment was not adequate to pay the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad, in favor of which it was first pledged. It was recited that the petitioners had not availed of the adjustment because they preferred waiting a restoration of the credit of the state, and trusted that the stock of the North Carolina Railroad might ultimately prove adequate to pay the bonds as reduced, issued in favor of the North Carolina Railroad, and the small amount of bonds which remained outstanding, as a result of the adjustment. It was declared that this had been accomplished; that in consequence of the reduced amount of the North Carolina Railroad bonds brought about by the adjustment, and the retirement thereby effected of all the bonds of the Western North Carolina Railroad except the small amount held or represented by the petitioners, the stock of the North Carolina Railroad held by the state, if sold, would be adequate to pay both series and leave a balance in favor of the state. Reciting that the petitioners and those they represented were aware that their claims against the state could not be judicially enforced either in the state or Federal courts, the prayer was that an appropriation might be made to pay their bonds in principal \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 325]\n\u00a0\n and accumulated interest; or that, in default, an act be passed authorizing suit in the courts to enforce the mortgage lien asserted to exist on the stock of the North Carolina Railroad. The prayer of this petition was not granted.\n Shortly following the failure to act favorably upon the petition just referred to, the act of the legislature of South Dakota, set out in the opinion of the court, was passed. It will be observed that, among other things, it empowered the governor to accept gifts made to the state of bonds or choses in action, and authorized the attorney general of the state, when such gifts were accepted, to bring suit in the name of the state to enforce payment of the same, and for that purpose 'to employ counsel to be associated with him in such suits or actions, who, with him, shall fully represent the state, and shall be entitled to reasonable compensation (italics mine) out of the recoveries and collections in such suits and actions.' Thereupon Simon Schafer addressed the letter to the Hon. Charles H. Burke, a member of Congress from South Dakota, which is reproduced in full in the opinion of the court. It suffices to say that by that letter ten of the bonds were given to the state of South Dakota, and it was specially mentioned that the gift was made because Schafer was aware that he could not sue the state of North Carolina, whilst the state of South Dakota could do so. The letter also contained the suggestion, presumably as an inducement to an acceptance by the state, that if the ten bonds were enforced by the state of South Dakota, other gifts of similar bonds might be made. The bonds were accepted by the governor of South Dakota, and the attorney general of that state thereupon filed the present bill. The parties-defendant were the state of North Carolina, a person sued as representing all the holders of bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad, and a person sued as representative of the holders of the outstanding bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad. The prayer of the bill was, in substance, for a decree against the state of North Carolina for the amount of the principal of the bonds, and for more than thirty years' accrued interest; for an enforcement of the mortgage asserted to exist on the stock of \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 326]\n\u00a0\n the North Carolina Railroad Company held by the state; for a decree declaring that the holders of the bonds issued in favor of the North Carolina Railroad Company had lost their prior lien upon the whole stock by reason of their acceptance of the compromise under the act of 1879, and the taking of new bonds by them in pursuance thereof. It was, however, prayed that in the event it should be found that the lien of such bondholders on the stock had not been waived, the stock be ordered sold, free from all encumbrances, to satisfy the claims of the respective lienholders thereon, and that distribution be made of the proceeds of the stock among them according to priority.\n The state answered, challenging the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the bill, and also urging various defenses on the merits.\n The person joined as representing the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad made no appearance. Charles Salter, who was made defendant as representative of the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad, answered, substantially admitting all the allegations of the bill, but praying 'that plaintiff's bill be dismissed with costs, unless the court shall decree that all the stock subject to the second mortgage be sold for the benefit of all the holders of said second mortgage bonds.'\n The court now decides that it has jurisdiction, because of the delegation in the 2d section of the 3d article of the Constitution, of judicial power to the United States over 'constroversies between two or more states,' and because of the grant to this court of original jurisdiction over cases in which a state shall be a party. Whilst conceding that, if the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad are necessary parties, the jurisdiction would be ousted, it is held that such bondholders are not necessary parties, since there may be a sale to enforce complainant's rights of a portion of the stock held by the state of North Carolina, subject to the prior rights therein of the holders of such bonds. The decree which will be entered will, therefore, adjudge the state of North Carolina to be indebted to South Dakota in the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 327]\n\u00a0\n amount of the principal of the ten bonds, with more than thirty years' accrued interest. The decree will direct the sale of the stock in the North Carolina Railroad Company held by the state, subject to the prior pledge in favor of the holders of the bonds of the North Carolina Railroad. The question of a deficiency decree is reserved, in case, as a result of the sale, the debt decreed against the state should not be extinguished.\n With this summary of the pleadings, the facts, and the decision of the court in mind, I shall now state the reasons which compel me to dissent, all of which may be embraced in the two following general propositions which I shall examine under separate headings: (A) The absolute want of power in the court to render a decree between the two states on the cause of action sued on; and (B) The want of power to render the decree which is now directed to be entered, because of the absence of essential parties whose presence would oust jurisdiction, and the impotency to grant any relief whatever in the absence of such parties.\n (A)\n The absolute want of power in the court to render a decree between the two states on the cause of action sued on.\n First. The power of this court to award a decree against the state of North Carolina is based on the provision in the 2d section of the 3d article of the Constitution, extending the judicial power of the United States over 'controversies between two or more states,' and to the delegation to this court of original jurisdiction over such controversies. If the provisions in question were the only ones on the subject it might be more difficult to deny that the Federal judicial power embraced this controversy. Those provisions, however, do not stand alone, since they must be considered in connection with the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, providing that 'the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.' \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 328]\n\u00a0\n The question which the case involves is not what, in a generic sense, may be considered a controversy between states, but whether the particular claim here asserted by the state of South Dakota is, in any view, such a controversy. It is also to be observed that the question is not whether a controversy between states may not arise from a debt originating as the result of a direct transaction between states, but is whether one state can acquire a claim asserted against another state by a citizen of that or of another state or an alien, and as a result sue upon it, and thereby create a controversy between states in a constitutional sense. Indeed, the question is narrower than this, since in this case the alleged debtor state had, years before the transfer of the claim in question, while it was yet owned by individuals, declined to recognize the debt, and had refused payment thereof, as the result of a controversy between itself and its alleged creditors.\n I take it to be an elementary rule of constitutional construction that no one provision of the Constitution is to be segregated from all the others, and to be considered alone, but that all the provisions bearing upon a particular subject are to be brought into view and to be so interpreted as to effectuate the great purposes of the instrument. If, in following this rule, it be found that an asserted construction of any one provision of the Constitution would, if adopted, neutralize a positive prohibition of another provision of that instrument, then it results that such asserted construction is erroneous, since its enforcement would mean, not to give effect to the Constitution, but to destroy a portion thereof. My mind cannot escape the conclusion that if, wherever an individual has a claim, whether in contract or tort, against a state, he may, by transferring it to another state, bring into play the judicial power of the United States to enforce such claim, then the prohibition contained in the 11th Amendment is a mere letter, without spirit and without force. This is said because no escape is seen from the conclusion if the application of the prohibition is to depend solely upon the willingness of the creditor of a state, whether citizen or alien, to transfer, and the docility or cupidity of another state in accepting such transfer, that the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 329]\n\u00a0\n provision will have no efficacy whatever. And this becomes doubly cogent when the history of the 11th Amendment is considered, and the purpose of its adoption is borne in mind.\n It is familiar that the amendment was adopted because of the decision of this court in 1793, in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L. ed. 440, holding that the grant of judicial power to the United States to determine controversies between a state and a citizen of another state vested authority to determine a controversy wherein a citizen of a state asserted a claim against another state. That the purpose of the amendment was to remove the possibility of the assertion of such a claim is aptly shown by the passage from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. ed. 257, as quoted in the opinion of the court in this case, saying (p. 406. L. ed. 291):\n'It is a part of our history that, at the adoption of the Constitution, all the states were greatly indebted; and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted; and the court maintained its jurisdiction. The alarm was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the State legislatures.'\n\n As the purpose of the amendment was to prohibit the enforcement of individual claims against the several states by means of the judicial power of the United States, and as the amendment was subsequent to the grant of judicial power made by the Constitution, the amendment qualified the whole grant of judicial power to the extent necessary to render it impossible, by indirection, to escape the operation of the avowed purpose which the people of the United States expressed in adopting the amendment. How, as declared by Chief Justice Marshall, could the adoption of the amendment have quieted the apprehensions concerning the right to enforce private claims against the states, if the power was left open, after the amendment, to do so if only they were transferred to another state? It is also to be observed that the construction now given causes the judicial power of the United States to embrace \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 330]\n\u00a0\n claims not within even the reach of the ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia, for that case only decided that under the grant of power a citizen of one state might sue another state. But under the rule of construction now announced, not only claims held by citizens of other states and aliens, but those held by a citizen of the state, become capable of enforcement, if only the holders of such claims, after the state has refused to pay them, choose to sell or make gift thereof to another state, found willing to become a party to a plan to evade a constitutional provision inserted for the protection of all the states.\n Let me, arguendo, grant that a case may be conceived of where one provisions of the Constitution can be so construed as to render nugatory another and applicable provision. Even such an impossible doctrine can have no relation to the case in hand. The decisions of this court, rendered since the 11th Amendment, have consistently held that that amendment embodied a principle of national public policy whose enforcement may not be avoided by indirection or subterfuge. Ought this rule of public policy to be disregarded by endowing every state with the power of speculating upon stale and unenforceable claims of individuals against other states, thus not only doing injustice, but also overthrowing the fiscal independence of every state, and destroying that harmony between them which it was the declared purpose of the Constitution to establish and cement? Such a departure from the provisions of the 11th Amendment, and the rule of national public policy which it embodies, may not be sustained by the assumption that it would be unduly curtailing the independence of the several states to deny them the right of enforcing, by the aid of the Federal judicial power, claims against other states, acquired from private individuals. For this assumption would amount to this,-that any and all of the states only enjoy the essential privilege of being free from coercion as to the claims of individuals, and have the power to manage their financial affairs at the mere pleasure of any of the other states. This is to say, that for the purpose of preserving the rights of the states, those rights must be destroyed.\n It is true that the greater number of cases decided by this \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 331]\n\u00a0\n court concerning the right to enforce a private claim against a state concerned controversies where suit was brought by citizens of other states or aliens, who were therefore persons expressly within the terms of the 11th Amendment. An analysis of those cases, however, will show that they were decided, not upon the mere ground that the person who sued was within the 11th Amendment, but upon the broad proposition that, by the effect of that amendment, claims of private individuals could not be enforced against a state, and that in upholding this constitutional limitation the court would look at the real nature of the controversy, irrespective of the parties on the record. If it were found by doing so that, in effect, the consequence of the granting of the relief would be to enforce, by the Federal judicial power, the claim of a private individual against a state, such relief would be denied. I content myself with the reference in the margin to the leading cases of this character,1 and come at once to consider the adjudications of this court rendered in two cases which directly related to the operation of the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment on the grant of judicial power to the United States over controversies between states, and to two other cases which directly concerned the effect of the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment in suits brought by persons who were within the grant of the judicial power, but were not embraced within the category of persons specifically referred to in the 11th Amendment. The first two cases referred to are New Hampshire v. Louisiana and New York v. Louisiana. The opinion \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 332]\n\u00a0\n of the court in both was delivered by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, and is reported (1883) in \n108 U.S. 76\n, 27 L. ed. 656, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176. The suits were originally brought in this court. The complainants were, in the one case, the state of New Hampshire, and in the other the state of New York; the principal defendant in both cases being the state of Louisiana. The complainant states asserted the right to enforce certain pecuniary claims against the state of Louisiana, as the holders of the naked legal title to certain coupons and bonds of the state of Louisiana, which, pursuant to legislative authority, by assignment, had been acquired from citizens of the respective states, for the purpose of collection for the benefit of such citizens. The defendant state challenged the jurisdiction of this court over the controversy. To sustain such jurisdiction it was pressed by the complainant that the bonds and coupons were negotiable instruments, of which the assignee states became the legal owners, and that as such they, as a matter of law, were the real parties in interest, whether the transfer was a complete sale or merely made for the purpose of collection for the benefit of the assignors. The court first considered the grant of judicial power to the United States prior to the adoption of the 11th Amendment, and held that as such power, when originally conferred, as interpreted in Chisholm v. Georgia, embraced the right of a citizen of one state to enforce his claims by suit directly against another state, a state could not, as the holder of the legal title, champion for its citizens a right for the prosecution of which a particular remedy had been provided by the Constitution. Coming to generally consider the effect of the 11th Amendment as elucidated by the history connected with its adoption, it was decided that as that amendment had expressly taken away the right of a citizen of one state to sue another state, a state could not enforce a right the assertion of which in the courts was prohibited to the citizen himself. Noticing the contention that the grant of judicial power over controversies between states was but a substitute for the surrender to the national government, which each state had made, of the power of prosecuting against another state, by force, if necessary, as a sovereign trustec for its citizens, the claims of such citizens, the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 333]\n\u00a0\n proposition was held not to be sustainable, under the Constitution of the United States. It was decided that the special remedy originally granted to the citizen himself 'must be deemed to have been the only remedy the citizen of one state could have under the Constitution against another state for the redress of his grievances, except such as the delinquent state saw fit itself to grant.' Having announced this doctrine, it was then as an inevitable deduction from it, decided that, as the 11th Amendment had taken away the special remedy originally provided by the Constitution, there was no other remedy whatever left. The opinion of the court concluded as follows (p. 91, L. ed. p. 662, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 184):\n'The evident purpose of the amendment, so promptly proposed and finally adopted, was to prohibit all suits against a state by or for citizens of other states, or aliens, without the consent of the state to be sued, and, in our opinion, one state cannot create a controversy with another state, within the meaning of that term as used in the judicial clauses of the Constitution, by assuming the prosecution of debts owing by the other state to its citizens. Such being the case, we are satisfied that we are prohibited, both by the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, from entertaining these suits, and the bill in each case is dismissed.'\n\n To me it seems that this adjudication is conclusive of the question now here. It, in the broadest way, determined that the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment controlled the grant of judicial power as to controversies between the states so as to exclude the possibility of that grant vesting a state with authority in any form, directly or indirectly, to set at naught the 11th Amendment. The case was decided, not upon the particular nature of the title of the bonds and coupons asserted by the states of New Hampshire and New York, since it was conceded that, but for the Constitution, a title such as that propounded would have given rise to an adequate cause of action. The ruling of the court was that, as suits against a state upon the claims of private individuals was absolutely prohibited by the 11th Amendment, such character of claim could not be converted into a controversy be- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 334]\n\u00a0\n tween states, and thus be made justiciable, since to do so would destroy the prohibition which the 11th Amendment embodied. I do not perceive, if one state may not engender a controversy between states, in the constitutional sense, in respect to claims arising out of dealings between a state and individuals, how it was competent for the state of South Dakota to create such a controversy by the acquisition of a claim of the class whose enforcement it was the purpose of the 11th Amendment to effectually prohibit. It is to be observed that in the cases referred to the court did not deny that a sovereign state, in virtue of its existence as such, would not have possessed the inherent power to prosecute against another state the claims of its citizens, and that such a prosecution by it would have constituted a controversy between states in the international significance of those words. But the court held that controversies between states, in the constitutional sense, did not embrace rights of that character, because of the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment, which operated upon the whole grant of judicial power, including, of course, such grant as to controversies between states.\n The two other cases to which I have referred are Hans v. Louisiana ( 1890) \n134 U.S. 1\n, 33 L. ed. 842, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504, and Smith v. Reeves (1900) \n178 U.S. 436\n, 44 L. ed. 1140, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 919. In the first, the opinion of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley; in the second, by Mr. Justice Harlan. In Hans v. Louisiana, a suit was brought in the circuit court of the United States against the state of Louisiana by a citizen of that state, under the claim that the rights asserted arose under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and therefore were not within the 11th Amendment, since that amendment only prohibited suits against a state by a citizen of another state or by aliens. The argument was pressed that as the guaranties of the Constitution were all-abiding, that it would be against public policy to deprive a citizen of the protection of the Constitution of the United States by bringing him within the spirit when he was not within the letter of the 11th Amendment. The court answered the contention in the broadest possible way. It held that the effect of the 11th Amendment was to qualify, \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 335]\n\u00a0\n to the extent of its prohibitions, the whole grant of judicial power, and, therefore, although a suit by a citizen of a state against a state, to enforce assumed constitutional rights, was not within the letter of the amendment, it was within its spirit, and there was no jurisdiction in the Federal courts over such controversy. In summing up its general conclusions the court said (p. 21, L. ed. p. 849, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 504):\n'It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the reason or expediency of the rule which exempts a sovereign state from prosecution in a court of justice at the suit of individuals. This is fully discussed by writers on public law. It is enough for us to declare its existence. The legislative department of a state represents its polity and its will; and is called upon by the highest demands of natural and political law to preserve justice and judgment, and to hold inviolate the public obligations. Any departure from this rule, except for reasons most cogent (of which the legislature, and not the courts, is the judge), never fails in the end to incur the odium of the world, and to bring lasting injury upon the state itself. But to deprive the legislature of the power of judging what the honor and safety of the state may require, even at the expense of a temporary failure to discharge the public debts, would be attended with greater evils than such failure can cause.'\n\n Smith v. Reeves was an action brought in the circuit court of the United States by a corporation created under an act of Congress, against the treasurer of the state of California, to obtain redress concerning certain taxes. The defendant challenged the jurisdiction upon the ground that in effect the action was one against a state. This court, concluding that the state of California was the real party in interest, was led to consider whether a Federal court was thereby deprived of jurisdiction. The contention on the part of the plaintiff was that, as a Federal corporation had a right to invoke, in virtue of the law of its creation, the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, the case was not controlled by the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment forbidding suits against a state by citizens of other states or aliens. The court, speaking through Mr. Jus- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 336]\n\u00a0\n tice Harlan, again adversely disposed of the contention, saying (p. 446, L. ed. p. 1145, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 923):\n'If the Constitution be so interpreted it would follow that any corporation created by Congress may sue a state in a circuit court of the United States upon any cause of action, whatever its nature, if the value of the matter in dispute is sufficient to give jurisdiction. We cannot approve this interpretation.' terpretation.'\n\n After referring to the views expressed by Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall, which were commented upon in Hans v. Louisiana, the court quoted approvingly the following passage from the opinion in Hans v. Louisiana:\n'It seems to us that these views of those great advocates and defenders of the Constitution were most sensible and just; and they applied equally to the present case as to that then under discussion. The letter is appealed to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an individual against a state. The reason against it is as strong in this case as it was in that. It is an attempt to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of. Can we suppose that, when the 11th Amendment was adopted, it was understood to be left open for citizens of a state to sue their own state in the Federal courts, whilst the idea of suits by citizens of other states, or of foreign states, was indignantly repelled? Suppose that Congress, when proposing the 11th Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a state from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the states? The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face.'\n\n The opinion concluded as follows (p. 449, L. ed. p. 1146, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 924):\n'It could never have been intended to exclude from Federal judicial power suits arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States when brought against a state by private individuals or state corporations, and at the same time extend such power to suits of like character brought by Federal corporations against a state without its consent.' \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 337]\n\u00a0\n Here again I am unable to perceive any ground for taking the case in hand out of the rulings made in the cases just reviewed. The letter of the 11th Amendment was just as inapplicable to a suit by a citizen of a state against a state to enforce his constitutional rights and to a suit by a Federal corporation, suing in the Federal court by virtue of its creation, as it was to the grant of judicial power over controversies between states. But the prohibition of the 11th Amendment was held to apply, because that amendment was again construed as prohibiting the enforcement of claims by private individuals against states through the judicial power of the United States, without reference to the character of the person by whom the claim was asserted. In other words, the decision was that the operation of the 11th Amendment was to be determined, not by the formal party complainant on the record, but by the essential character and nature of the claim or right which was asserted. This being the decision, how, consistently, can the state of South Dakota be held to have power to give effect to a character of claim as to which the 11th Amendment declares the judicial power of the United States shall not extend?\n\n Will not the accuracy of what I have just stated, as applied to this case, be demonstrated by putting the question which this court put in Hans v. Louisiana and approvingly reiterated in Smith v. Reeves, and giving it the answer which the court gave in those cases, changing, of course, the form of the question to meet the case now here? For this purpose, I repeat the question, placing, however, in brackets the changed mode of expression necessitated by the difference in the character of the parties complainant. 'Suppose that Congress, when proposing the 11th Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a state from being sued' [upon private claims due to its own citizens or to aliens or citizens of other states, if only such claims were sold or otherwise disposed of long after the debtor state had refused to pay them, so as to thus secure their judicial enforcement] 'can we imagine that the 11th Amendment would have been adopted by the states? The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face.' \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 338]\n\u00a0\n Nor do I think the previous decisions of this court, which are relied upon as establishing that the state of South Dakota may maintain this suit, have any such tendency. Of course, it is not by me denied that a dispute as to boundaries between two states is judicially cognizable as a controversy between states, and that such may also be the case where one state asserts property rights against another, provided, always, that the assertion of the particular right does not violate the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment. So, also, in my opinion, United States v. North Carolina, \n136 U.S. 211\n, 34 L. ed. 336, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 920, and United States v. Texas, \n143 U.S. 621\n, 36 L. ed. 285, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488, instead of sustaining the view that the cause of action here asserted can be treated, despite the provisions of the 11th Amendment, as a controversy between states, establish the contrary. In United States v. North Carolina, the United States sued the state of North Carolina concerning the interest on certain bonds. No objection was taken by North Carolina to the jurisdiction of the court, since that state voluntarily assented to a judicial determination of the issue involved. There was, and could have been, therefore, no question of jurisdiction, so far as the state of North Carolina was concerned. The only question of jurisdiction which could have arisen was whether a suit by the United States against a state was within the constitutional grant of judicial power. Although the court, in its opinion in United States v. North Carolina, did not refer to the subject of jurisdiction, it must be assumed that it was considered. This is shown by a remark concerning United States v. North Carolina, made by the court in the course of its opinion in United States v. Texas, to the following effect:\n'It is true that no question was made as to the jurisdiction of this court, and nothing was therefore said in the opinion upon that subject. But it did not escape the attention of the court, and the judgment would not have been rendered except upon the theory that this court has original jurisdiction of a suit by the United States against the state.'\n\n Those two cases, therefore, so far as jurisdiction is concerned, simply determined that the grant of judicial power concerning controversies between states, whilst not in letter embrac- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 339]\n\u00a0\n ing a suit brought by the United States against a state, in spirit and purpose did give jurisdiction of a suit of that character. The effect of these rulings, then, was but to cause a suit by the United States against a state to be within the meaning of controversies between states. In other words, in ascertaining the import of the grant of judicial power as to controversies between states, the court gave force to the spirit and purpose of the Constitution in order to include a suit by the United States against a state within the category of controversies between states. This was simply applying the same rule of construction to the grant of judicial power for the purpose of including the United States, which had been previously applied in Hans v. Louisiana, in Smith v. Reeves, and in all the other cases to which I have referred, in order to exclude jurisdiction over controversies, to entertain which would have been a violation of the spirit and purpose of the 11th Amendment. When United States v. North Carolina and United States v. Texas are considered, it seems to me clear that the decision now made not only is destructive of the inherent rights of the states as protected by the 11th Amendment, but also strips the government of the United States of its rights as a sovereign, belonging to it under the Constitution. As, under the decisions referred to, a suit between the United States and a state is within the grant of judicial power over controversies between states, it must follow that a suit by a state against the United States is also of that character. Now, as the ruling is that such a controversy may include the claim of a private individual, if only such claim be transferred to a state, it follows that a suit by a state against the United States on a claim of that character is within the grant of judicial power. Thus it has come to pass that any and every claim against the United States, whatever be its character is enforceable against the United States if only a state chooses to acquire and prosecute its enforcement. It is no answer to suggest that such claims of private individuals are not justiciable unless the law of the United States has caused them to be so, for if the constitutional grant of judicial power embraces such contro- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 340]\n\u00a0\n versies, as is now necessarily held, any restriction by Congress would be repugnant to the Constitution.\n My reason does not perceive how the principles which have been stated and the rulings of this court enforcing them are rendered inapplicable by the suggestion that, as the court may not inquire into the motives actuating a particular transfer of right, therefore it is without power to refuse to enforce in behalf of South Dakota the alleged gift. This proceeds upon the assumption that the want of jurisdiction to enforce a private claim against a state depends upon motive. But the absence of such jurisdiction rests upon the constitutional prohibition, which addresses itself to the very nature of the cause of action, and imposes upon the court the duty to inquire into it The power of the court when such is the case, even in a case brought in this court by one of the states of the Union to enforce an alleged pecuniary right, is aptly illustrated by Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co. \n127 U.S. 265\n, 35 L. ed. 239, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1370. There the state of Wisconsin, having obtained a judgment against the defendant corporation in the courts of Wisconsin, availed of the original jurisdiction of this court to sue the defendant corporation to enforce the judgment. It was held that, as the judgment was for a penalty imposed by the laws of Wisconsin, and as penalties had no extraterritorial operation, the court would look at the origin of the rights upon which the judgment was based, and, doing so, declined to enforce the judgment. See also Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 47 L. ed. 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237. If, as the result of merely a general rule of law against the extraterritorial operation of statutory penalties, this court looked beyond the judgment sued on by a state to the cause of action merged in the judgment, and refused relief, the court now must have the power to look into the present cause of action and the origin of the rights asserted by the state of South Dakota. To do otherwise seems to me is but to declare that a general principle of law restricting the extraterritorial enforcement of penal statutes must be held to have more sanctity than the declared will of the people of the United States, expressed in the 11th Amendment. Indeed, the existence of power in this court to inquire into purpose and motive in suits brought by one \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 341]\n\u00a0\n state against another state was directly upheld in New Hampshire v. Louisiana and New York v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 27 L. ed. 656, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176. It was not denied in those cases that the bonds sued upon were negotiable, and that if the rules of law controlling in controversies between private individuals were to be applied, the title of each plaintiff state to the bonds it sought recovery upon could not be gainsaid, but should be regarded as absolute. Coming, however, to enforce the provisions of the 11th Amendment, the court held that it was its duty to depart from the rule ordinarily applied, and to examine into the nature of the asserted rights, and if to give effect thereto would be inconsistent with constitutional provisions, to refuse to lend its aid to the enforcement of the claims.\n Second. But putting out of view what seem to be the controlling principles previously stated, let me now look at the controversy from a narrower point of view and consider the rights of the parties by those considerations which would apply to the enforcement of private rights. It is unquestioned on the record that the bonds given to the state of South Dakota and upon which its action is based were past due at the time of the gift, and that for more than twenty years prior to the gift the state of North Carolina had, by her legislation, held herself not bound to pay the same. That these facts were known to the state of South Dakota when it accepted the gift is shown. The makers of the gift could not transfer to the state of South Dakota rights which they had not. In other words, if, when the gift was made, that which was parted with was not susceptible, and had never been susceptible, of legal enforcement because not embodying a justiciable obligation against the state of North Carolina, the state of South Dakota could not, by the acceptance of the gift, acquire greater rights than were possessed by the transferrer. I take it to be the elementary rule of public law that, whilst the contracts of a sovereign may engender natural or moral obligations, and are, in one sense, property, they are yet obligations resting on the promise of the sovereign, and possessing no other sanction than the good faith and honor of the sovereign itself. These principles, as applied to the states of \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 342]\n\u00a0\n this Union, are the necessary resultant of the adoption of the 11th Amendment. It is not necessary to refer to opinions of publicists on the general subject, since this court-as to the states of the Union-has declared the doctrine so fully as to leave it no longer an open question in this forum.\n The concluding passages already quoted from the opinion in Hans v. Louisiana, 33 L. ed. 842, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504, approvingly referred to in Smith v. Reeves, state the subject in the clearest possible way. Prior to the cases just mentioned, however, this court in numerous decisions had announced the same doctrine. A few of the more important of those cases will now be briefly noticed. In Re Ayers (1887) \n123 U.S. 443\n, 31 L. ed. 216, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164, the court, speaking, through Mr. Justice Matthews, said (p. 504, L. ed. p. 229, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 182):\n'It cannot be doubted that the 11th Amendment to the Constitution operates to create an important distinction between contracts of a state with individuals and contracts between individual parties. In the case of contracts between individuals, the remedies for their enforcement or breach, in existence at the time they were entered into, are a part of the agreement itself, and constitute a substantial part of its obligation. Louisiana v. New Orleans, \n102 U.S. 203\n, 26 L. ed. 132. That obligation, by virtue of the provision of article I.,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, cannot be impaired by any subsequent state legislation. Thus, not only the covenants and conditions of the contract are preserved, but also the substance of the original remedies for its enforcement. It is different with contracts between individuals and a state. In respect to these, by virtue of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, there being no remedy by a suit against the state, the contract is substantially without sanction, except that which arises out of the honor and good faith of the state itself, and these are not subject to coercion. Although the state may, at the inception of the contract, have consented, as one of its conditions, to subject itself to suit, it may subsequently withdraw that consent and resume its original immunity, without any violation of the obligation of its contract in the constitutional sense. Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 15 L. ed. 991; Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Tennessee, \n101 U.S. 337\n, 25 L. ed. 960. The very \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 343]\n\u00a0\n object and purpose of the 11th Amendment were to prevent the indignity of subjecting a state to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties. It was thought to be neither becoming nor convenient that the several states of the Union, invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of private persons, whether citizens of other states or aliens, or that the course of their public policy and the administration of their public affairs should be subject to, and controlled by, the mandates of judicial tribunals, without their consent, and in favor of individual interests. To secure the manifest purposes of the constitutional exemption guaranteed by the 11th Amendment requires that it should be interpreted, not literally and too narrowly, but fairly, and with such breadth and largeness as effectually to accomplish the substance of its purpose.'\n\n There is another and allied reason which seems to me equally decisive against this claim. As will be observed from the passage already quoted from the opinion of this court in Re Ayers, \n123 U.S. 443\n, 31 L. ed. 216, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164, it was there affirmatively declared that as the obligation of a state rested but on its conceptions of moral duty, the state itself, under the great responsibilities which attach to it as a sovereign, was the ultimate tribunal to whom the creditor agreed, at the very inception of the contract, to submit his rights. And that where a sovereign state, in the discharge of the public duty thus resting upon it, declared against the payment of an obligation, such conclusion by the sovereign was a determination by the tribunal which had been impliedly agreed on, and was binding upon the creditor, and, as a result of the 11th Amendment, not susceptible of review or change by the courts of the United States. Applying this doctrine to this case it is apparent that years before the transfer of the bonds to the state of South Dakota, the state of North Carolina had, through its duly constituted authorities, determined that the holder of the bonds in question had not the right now asserted by the state of South Dakota under the transfer from such \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 344]\n\u00a0\n creditor. This, after all, only serves additionally to demonstrate the fallacy underlying the assumption that the state of South Dakota, because it is a state and may avail of the grant of judicial power over controversies between states, can, in doing so, escape the prohibition of the 11th Amendment, created for the very purpose of protecting the states and preserving their independent control over their own affairs. It seems to me the gross inequality which must arise from disregarding the judgment of the tribunal selected by the creditor is well illustrated by this case. When the facts which I have at the outset stated are recalled, it will be observed that there were about two and a haf millions of dollars of outstanding bonds of the same series as those now owned by the state of South Dakota, and that that amount was reduced to about $250,000 of principal, as a consequence of the conclusion of the state of North Carolina concerning the exigencies of its financial situation. It is also certain, when the facts stated in the petition presented to the legislature of North Carolina by the assignor of the state of South Dakota are recalled, that but for this vast reduction of the debt produced by the determination of the state of North Carolina, the alleged security now sought to be realized upon by the state of South Dakota would be of no value. The moral attitude shown by the record, then, is this: that the state of South Dakota, as the mere beneficiary of the bounty of an individual, seeks to derive all the benefit resulting from the judgment of the state of North Carolina as to its public debt, and, at the same time, desires to repudiate that judgment, and to obtain rights which never would have been within its reach if the judgment of the state of North Carolina had not been exercised. Under these circumstances it to me seems, even if a court of equity was vested with power to disregard the final judgment of the tribunal selected at the time the bonds were issued, such court should not exercise that power in favor of one standing on the record in the position which the state of South Dakota here occupies.\n Looking at the question from a yet narrower point of view, the same conclusion seems to me to be impelled. In United \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 345]\n\u00a0\n States v. Buford (1830) 3 Pet. 12, 7 L. ed. 585, the question was considered whether a claim acquired by the government of the United States from an individual, which was barred by limitation at the time of its acquisition by the United States, was yet enforceable in the hands of the government. The court decided that, as against the United States, under such circumstances, despite the general exemption of the government from the operation of such statute, the bar of the statute was operative. The court said (p. 30, L. ed. p. 591):\n'It can require no argument to show that the transfer of any claim to the United States cannot give to it any greater validity than it possessed in the hands of the assignor.'\n\n And this principle was applied by the court of exchequer in King v. Morrall, 6 Price, 24, cited approvingly in United States v. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. \n118 U.S. 125\n, 30 L. ed. 83, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1006. The facts of the case were, in brief, as follows: On a scire facias it was sought by the Crown to recover from a creditor of a debtor to the Crown the amount of a certain bill of exchange. On demurrer to a plea of the statute of limitations it was contended that the right of the Crown was not barred by the statute,-by a plea which, in point of fact, admitted the debt. The court held otherwise. Lord Chief Baron Richards observed (p. 28):\n'The Crown is only entitled to its debtor's right, and cannot create or revive any right in the person of its debtor if none ever existed, or it has become extinct. In this case, nothing could have been recovered by the debtor of the Crown against this defendant if the statute had been pleaded; I therefore consider that it is also a good bar to the suit of the Crown, who stands precisely in the same situation as its debtor, and that this is an honest plea, which, therefore, the law allows. If the Crown could thus put its debtor in a better situation than he was in before, by such a proceeding as this, the consequences would be monstrous before the passing of the late statute, and the mischief would have been incalculable.'\n\n Wood, Baron, said (p. 29):\n'In this case, the claim of the Crown is only a derivative right, and it must, therefore, stand in the same situation as its principal.' \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 346]\n\u00a0\n Garrow, Baron, remarked (p. 31):\n\n'By a process, said, by a fiction, to be for the benefit of the Crown, it is attempted to revive the debt, and place the creditor in a better situation than the law permits. This is too gross an absurdity; . . .'\n\n These authorities additionally demonstrate that a claim which, when acquired by the state of South Dakota, was without legal sanction, did not, by the mere fact of such acquisition, become a justiciable, enforceable right. It may be said that there was no statute of limitations in the state of North Carolina barring the claim. But this begs the whole question. It assumes that the state of North Carolina should have indulged in the idle ceremony of passing a special statute of limitations extinguishing, after the lapse of a certain time, a cause of action which had never existed. The proposition is but a further illustration of the misconception which results from holding that the claim of an individual against a state, which is not enforceable, can be made such by the voluntary act of transferring. The very attribute of sovereignty renders it unnecessary for the sovereign to legislate for its own behalf in the passage of statutes of limitations, insolvent and other like laws, as his will, controlled alone by the duty and sense of responsibility which sovereignty must be presumed to engender, determines the question of liability.\n But let me analyze the proposition in order to see what it leads to. What is a statute of limitations? It is but the action of the state in determining that, after the lapse of a specified time, a claim shall not be legally enforceable. In this case, from the very inception of the alleged obligation to the time of the transfer to the state of South Dakota, there was no legal cause of action for the enforcement of the claim under the laws of North Carolina, and by the obligation of the 11th Amendment no cause of action on the subject could be asserted to exist in any court of the United States. To hold that there is a right to recover in this case which would not exist if there had been a statute of limitations barring the cause of action, although none had ever arisen, is but to say that the right of the parties is to be determined by words hav- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 347]\n\u00a0\n ing no significance whatever. The fact that the state of North Carolina, in her own courts, was not subject to be coerced as to the claim in question, was, in effect, a state statute of limitations, since the act of the state in forbidding the arising of a cause of action is certainly in reason the equivalent of an act of that state barring a cause of action in a case where one could exist. It is the nonexistence of the cause of action at the time of the transfer, upon which rests the rule preventing a sovereign from recovering on a claim which was barred at the time he acquired it. This is true also of the 11th Amendment. As that amendment from the date of the inception of the alleged contract prohibited the assertion of any cause of action concerning the same in the courts of the United States, the amendment was substantially a national statute of limitations. Thus operating, it furnishes an effectual barrier, preventing the state of South Dakota from asserting in the courts of the United States that it had acquired from its transferrer a cause of action which the Constitution of the United States prevented from ever existing so far as the judicial power of the United States was concerned.\n Nor does the fact that the state of South Dakota alleges there was a pledge or mortgage of certain stock in the North Carolina Railroad serve at all to take the case out of the control of the provisions of the 11th Amendment. It is not pretended that any delivery of stock alleged to have been pledged was ever made to the bondholders; on the contrary, it is conceded that the stock in question has always been in the possession of the state of North Carolina. The right to enforce the alleged pledge must therefore rest upon the power to enforce a private claim against the state of North Carolina, and to take from its possession property of which it has ever had the absolute dominion and control. And this view is, to my mind, concluded by the previous rulings of this court, one of which I shall now particularly notice.\n Christian v. Atlantic & N. C. R. Co. (1890) \n133 U.S. 233\n, 33 L. ed. 589, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260, was a bill in equity to reach dividends on the stock of the railroad company, and apply such dividends to the payment of bonds issued by the state of North Carolina, \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 348]\n\u00a0\n and for a sale of stock owned and held by the state. It was contended by the defendants that the proceeding was in substance against the state, and therefore within the prohibitions of the 11th Amendment. The correctness of this contention was denied, on the ground that there was a valid contract in favor of the complainant; that by that contract there was a pledge in its favor; and that the object of the suit was not to hold the state of North Carolina or to sue it, but to proceed in rem against the stock to enforce the right in and to it resulting from the contract. The court-not at all disputing that, if the premise was correct, the legal conclusion based on it was well founded-proceeded to test the accuracy of the premise. It found that the stock in question had never been actually delivered to the alleged pledgee, but had always remained in the possession of the agents of the state. Reaching this conclusion, it was held that there was no pledge unless such contract resulted from the declaration of the state that the stock held by it was pledged. Coming to consider that question, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, said (p. 242, L. ed. p. 592, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 263):\n'It is no more of a pledge than is made by a farmer when he pledges his growing crop or his stock of cattle for the payment of a debt, without any delivery thereof. He does not use the word in its technical, but in its popular, sense. His language may amount to a parol mortgage, if such a mortgage can be created; but that is all. So, in this case, the pledge given by the state in a statute may have amounted to a mortgage, but it could amount to nothing more; and if a mortgage, it did not place the mortgagee in possession, but gave him merely a naked right to have the property appropriated and applied to the payment of his debt. But how is that right to be asserted? If the mortgagor be a private person, the mortgagee may cite him into court and have a decree for the foreclosure and sale of the property. The mortgagor, or his assignee, would be a necessary party in such a proceeding. Even when absent, beyond the reach of process, he must still be made a party and at least constructively cited, by publication or otherwise. This is established by the authorities before \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 349]\n\u00a0\n referred to, and many more might be cited to the same effect. The proceeding is a suit against the party to obtain, by decree of court, the benefit of the mortgage right. But where the mortgagor in possession is a sovereign state, no such proceeding can be maintained. The mortgagee's right against the state may be just as good and valid, in a moral point of view, as if it were against an individual. But the state cannot be brought into court or sued by a private party without its consent. It was at first held by this court that, under the Constitution of the United States, a state might be sued in it by a citizen of another state, or of a foreign state; but it was declared by the 11th Amendment that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to such suits. New Hampshire v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 27 L. ed. 656, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176; Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 U.S. 711\n, 27 L. ed. 448, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 128; Marye v. Parsons, \n114 U.S. 325\n, 29 L. ed. 205, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 932, 962; Hagood v. Southern, \n117 U.S. 52\n, 29 L. ed. 805, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 608; Re Ayers, \n123 U.S. 443\n, 31 L. ed. 216, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164.'\n\n Applying the ruling made in the case just cited to the case in hand, it to me clearly results that as possession of the alleged pledged or mortgaged stock was never parted with by the state of North Carolina, the right asserted by the state of South Dakota to enforce the alleged pledge comes directly within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment, since in its essence it depends upon the existence in this court of the power to enforce against the state of North Carolina in favor of the state of South Dakota, a mere promise made by North Carolina to a private individual, as to which the state of South Dakota acquired no greater right than was possessed by the individual who made the transfer to it of the bonds in question.\n Third. Finally, putting out of view the various considerations which I have previously stated, in my opinion this record discloses a condition of things which ought to prevent a court of equity from exerting its powers to enforce, for the benefit of the state of South Dakota, the claim which it asserts against the state of North Carolina. From the facts which I have at the outset recited, it is undeniable that at the time the gift was made to the state of South Dakota of the bonds in question, \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 350]\n\u00a0\n they were past due, and payment thereof had, more than twenty years prior to the gift, been refused by the state of North Carolina. The letter evidencing the gift demonstrates that the purpose of the gift to the state of South Dakota was to enable that state to assert a cause of action against the state of North Carolina which did not exist in favor of the transferrer. It also appears, by the act of the legislature of South Dakota, under which this suit was brought, that the state of South Dakota deemed that it might acquire a mere right to litigate, since the act itself in advance provided that the attorney general of the state should prosecute actions in the name of the state to recover on bonds or choses in action which might be transferred to the state, and that it contemplated litigation without cost to itself, since the act empowered the attorney general to employ counsel to prosecute suits, the compensation to be paid out of the proceeds which might be realized. This condition of things, in my opinion, although it may not be champertous in the strict sense of that word, is in its nature equivalent to a champertous engagement, whose enforcement is contrary to public policy, and one which a court therefore ought not to lend its aid to carry into effect. It has been sometimes said that the doctrine of maintenance and champerty has no application to the sovereign. But this can alone be justified by taking into view the high attributes which pertain to sovereignty. Now, if the state of South Dakota may avail of the delegation of judicial power over controversies between states power conferred in view of the sovereign dignity of all the states-for the purpose of destroying the sovereignty of another state by subjecting such state to judicial coercion concerning a claim of a private individual, then it seems to me the state of South Dakota should be treated as any other private individual seeking to enforce a private claim, and should have applied to it by a court of equity the principles of morality and justice which control such courts in refusing aid to persons who acquire merely litigious and speculative claims. As said by this court, in the course of its opinion in Randolph v. Quidnick Co. (1890) \n135 U.S. 457\n, 34 L. ed. 200, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 655: 'It is a case where equity, true to its ideas of sub- \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 351]\n\u00a0\n stantial justice, refuses to be bound by the letter of legal procedure, or to lend its aid to a mere speculative purchase which threatens injury and ruin to a large body of honest creditors, who have trusted for the payment of their debts to the legal validity of proceedings theretofore taken.' How aptly these observations apply to the case in hand is shown when it is considered that the holders of more than two million dollars of bonds of the same class as that held by the state of South Dakota, more than twenty years before the transfer to that state, accepted, on the faith of the operation of the 11th Amendment, and the circumstances surrounding the state of North Carolina at the time, the adjustment proposed by the act of 1879; and therefore that the claim of South Dakota now urged, in effect, as I have previously stated, seeks to avail of the result brought about by the operation of the 11th Amendment, and yet at the same time to deny its efficacy as regards the rights which it claims. It is additionally shown by the inference arising from the record that the whole fiscal system of the state of North Carolina in existence since the adjustment of 1879 has rested upon the action taken by the creditors of the state consequent upon their reliance upon the possession by the state of the attributes of sovereignty which it was the purpose of the 11th Amendment to consecrate.\n But eliminating all the previous reasoning, and considering the case upon the hypothesis that the controversy is one between states, nevertheless I am of opinion that the court is without jurisdiction. And the statement of the reasons which impel me to this conclusion involves an examination of the second proposition which was by me at the outset stated, that is,-- (B)\n The want of power to render the decree which is now directed to be entered, because of the absence of essential parties, whose presence would oust jurisdiction, and the impotency to grant any relief whatever in the absence of such parties.\n Even under the view that the general conclusions of the \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 352]\n\u00a0\n court as to its authority over the controversy as one between states is well founded, I cannot agree that the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad are not essential parties to this controversy, since the nature of the relief specifically prayed necessitates their presence, and since, without such presence, in my opinion, no decree giving substantial relief to the complainant or doing justice to the principal defendant can be rendered. If they are such essential parties, it is not questioned that the court is without jurisdiction. California v. Southern P. Co. \n157 U.S. 229\n, 39 L. ed. 683, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 591.\n Under the assumption that there was a valid mortgage in favor of the complainant and other holders of the same class of bonds, the bill proceeds upon the theory that it is essential that it be determined what claim or right the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad have upon or in the stock in question. To that end the bill challenged the existence of any right of pledge in favor of such bondholders, upon the theory that, as against the holders of bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad, they had lost their right by accepting the compromise of 1879. It is, however, further asserted in the bill that, even if the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad had not, by accepting the compromise of 1879, lost their rights as to the complainant and those similarly situated, yet, as the pledge was past due when the adjustment of 1879 was entered into, it was essential, to afford the complainant relief as a junior secured creditor on the stock, that the entire stock be sold, free from all encumbrances. And this was also the position taken by the answer filed on behalf of the representative of the outstanding bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad. The bill, then, having been framed upon the theory of the necessity of the specific relief referred to, which could not be afforded without the presence of the other lienholders, the cause, it seems to me, ought not now to be decided upon a wholly different theory, and relief inconsistent with that specifically prayed for be awarded to the complainant upon that changed basis. \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 353]\n\u00a0\n But, leaving out of view the considerations just stated, it seems to me the decree which it is proposed to enter cannot afford any specific relief to the complainant without destroying, or materially impairing, the rights of the prior lienholders, although they are now held not to be essential parties to the controversy. The pledge in favor of the holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad was of all the stock, and for the benefit of all the bonds. It was therefore indivisible. It cannot be divided without impairing the obligations of the contract in favor of those creditors. Now, whilst each of the ten mortgages which it is in effect held the complainant possesses purported to be of ten shares of stock securing each bond, no particular ten shares were delivered, segregated, or identified. As a result no division of the stock held by the state had in fact ever been made, and, therefore, each and every one of the ten shares assumed to be mortgaged to secure each of the bonds were subject to the prior lien on all the stock in favor of all the holders of bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. When the attempt is made to enforce the decree in this case, what shares will be sold? If any particular shares, then, unless the rights of the prior lienholders are to be rendered divisible, although they are indivisible, the shares sold must continue to be subject to the entire pledge in favor of all the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. To state this situation, it seems to me, is to demonstrate that the decree will afford no substantial relief whatever. The best that can be said, under such circumstances, is that the effect of a sale so made will be merely to foment a law suit. A court of equity, when its aid is invoked to give particular relief, if it finds that it is unable to do it, ought not, whilst denying such relief, to enter a decree which confers no substantial relief, but, on the contrary, can only serve as a fruitful source of future litigation, injurious to the rights of the very party or class of persons in whose favor the decree is rendered. But this is not all, for whilst the decree will, in substance, deprive the complainant of any real benefit from his assumed security, a sale under the decree must also result injuriously to the state \n\n[192 U.S. 286, 354]\n\u00a0\n of North Carolina. Its rights, as well as those of the complainant, are entitled to consideration. The possibility of a deficiency decree is now taken into account in the opinion, and rights on that subject are reserved. But if the sale which is to be ordered is one which must lead to a prejudicial result, then the effect of the decree is simply to order a sale which can produce at best no more than a nominal sum, and will lay a foundation for a deficiency decree for an amount wholly out of proportion to the actual value of the mortgaged property. It is to my mind no answer to point out that whilst there was no segregation and delivery of the ten shares of stock mortgaged to secure each bond, as such division was provided for, a court of equity will treat that as being done which should have been done. The fallacy of this lies in failing to consider the rights of the prior lienholders, and overlooking the fact that their lien was indivisible, and that the segregation provided for in the act of 1866 could not be made without being subordinate to the entire sum of the prior and indivisible right of pledge. When this is borne in mind it results that the rights of those prior lienholders are necessarily clouded or impaired by decreeing that a court of equity will treat that as having been done which ought to have been done, when the very question is, Could it have been done efficaciously, consistently with the rights of the prior lienholders? They are, therefore, I submit, essential parties, if it is proposed to give any real relief by the decree of sale which is ordered. If it is not proposed to give that character of relief, then such a decree ought not to be entered, especially when it does not accord with, and in reality is inconsistent with, the specific relief asked for.\n I am authorized to say that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Day concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hollingsworth v.

Defendants alleged that the lands lay wholly within the county of Cherokee, in the state of North Carolina, and that they were lawfully granted to their ancestor by that state.\n The issue involved the true boundary line between North Carolina and Tennessee. The circuit court held that the lands lay in the state of North Carolina, and that the title was in defendants, and dismissed the bill.\n Thereupon an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, and, on hearing, the decree of the circuit court was affirmed. 53 C. C. A. 467, 116 Fed. 147.\n From the decree of the circuit court of appeals this appeal was prosecuted.\n T. S. Webb, Hu. L. McClung, Charles Seymour, and L. M. G. Baker for appellants.\n Messrs. John W. Green and Samuel G. Shields for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n If the jurisdiction of the circuit court was dependent entirely on diversity of citizenship, the decree of the circuit court of appeals was final, and this appeal cannot be maintained. The contention of appellants is that it was not so dependent because jurisdiction also existed in that the parties claimed under grants from different states, to which it is replied that, under the Constitution and laws, the circuit courts are not vested with jurisdiction on that ground except when the parties are citizens of the same state.\n By  1 of article 3 of the Constitution it is provided \n\n[195 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n that \"the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.\" And by  2 that \"the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state, between citizens of different states, between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects. 2. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the Congress shall make.\"\n The Supreme Court alone \"possesses jurisdiction derived immediately from the Constitution, and of which the legislative power cannot deprive it\" (United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32, 3 L. ed. 259), but the jurisdiction of the circuit courts depends upon some act of Congress ( Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8, 10, 1 L. ed. 718, 719; M'Intire v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 504, 506, 3 L. ed. 420, 421).\n The use of the word \"controversies\" as in contradistinction to the word \"cases,\" and the omission of the word 'all' in respect of controversies, left it to Congress to define the controversies over which the courts it was empowered to ordain and establish might exercise jurisdiction, and the manner in which it was to be done.\n By the 11th section of the judiciary act of September 24, 1789, it was provided that the circuit courts of the United States should \"have original cognizance, concurrent with the \n\n[195 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of five hundred dollars, and the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or an alien is a party, or the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought and a citizen of another state.\" [1 Stat. at L. 78, chap. 20.]\n In Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61, 85, 3 L. ed. 38, 44, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said:\n\"The judicial power of the United States, as defined in the Constitution, is dependent, 1st, on the nature of the case; and, 2d, on the character of the parties. By the judicial act, the jurisdiction of the circuit court is extended to cases where the constitutional right to plead and be impleaded, in the courts of the Union, depends on the character of the parties; but where that right depends on the nature of the case, the circuit courts derive no jurisdiction from that act, except in the single case of a controversy between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants from different states.\"\n\n And that jurisdiction was conferred by the 12th section of the act, which provided that \"if in any action commenced in a state court the title of land is concerned, and the parties are citizens of the same state,\" either party might remove the cause to the circuit court on the fact being made to appear that the parties claimed under grants of different states. This section was carried forward as  647 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 524, and reappears in substance in  3 of the act of March 3, 1875. 18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 1, 37, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 510.\n By the 1st section of the latter act original jurisdiction was given to the circuit courts of cases, among others, \"arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties,\" or in which there was \"a controversy between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states.\"\n The acts of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373), and of August 13, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866), are to the same purport.\n Two cases arising under the judiciary act of 1789 are cited: \n\n[195 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 292, 3 L. ed. 735, decided March 10, 1815, and Colson v. Lewis, 2 Wheat. 377, 4 L. ed. 266, decided March 14, 1817\n\n\n In Pawlet v. Clark it appeared that the parties were citizens of Vermont, and that the cases were pending in the circuit court for the district of Vermont, but the reporter's statement does not show that the case was commenced in the state court. The record on file in this court, however, discloses that such was the fact, and that the cause was removed into the circuit court under the 12th section.\n Colson v. Lewis is not well reported. It was a bill in equity in which Lewis and others were complainants and Rawleigh Colson was the sole defendant. It came here on certificate, and the title was \"Lewis and others against Colson,\" and not as given in the report. The case stated shows that the case was removed from the state court into the circuit court of Kentucky, and that the complainants were citizens of Virginia; but the citizenship of defendant was not disclosed. The headnote asserts that the parties were citizens of Kentucky. But the certificate of the clerk, as appears from our files, sets forth \"that it is stated in the bill that the deft. Rawleigh Colson is a citizen of the state of Virginia.\"\n In both cases the parties were citizens of the same state, and the cases were originally commenced in the state courts, and the circuit courts acquired jurisdiction by removal. The judiciary act of 1789 vested the circuit courts with original jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, but not where title was claimed under grants of different states. Congress manifestly accepted the letter of the Constitution, and, as the judicial power extended to controversies where citizens of the same state claimed title under grants of different states, assumed that cases presenting such controversies would be commenced in the state courts, and provided that those cases might be removed when that fact was made to appear. The particular constitutional provision was treated as not open to a construction which would make it embrace \n\n[195 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n citizens of different states. Naturally enough, as the reason for the extension of the Federal judicial power to controversies between citizens of different states, and to controversies between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, was in substance the same. 2 Story, Const.  1696.\n And when the act of 1875 enlarged the original jurisdiction, no view to the contrary was indicated.\n Ayres v. Polsdorfer, \n187 U.S. 585\n, 47 L. ed. 314, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 196, was an action of ejectment brought in the circuit court by citizens of one state against those of another, and the case, having gone to judgment, was carried to the circuit court of appeals, and the judgment affirmed. A writ of error from this court was then sought to be sustained because, as was contended, the evidence disclosed, though the pleadings did not, that the parties claimed under grants of different states. But we held that if the emergence of such a question might have justified taking the case directly to this court, having gone to the court of appeals, it could not, after judgment, then be brought here.\n As Congress has not conferred jurisdiction on the circuit courts over controversies between citizens of different states because, apart from diversity of citizenship, they may have claimed title by grants from different states, even if it had power to do so, which is not conceded, the result is that the appeal must be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUN PRINTING & PUBLISHING ASS'N v.

Upon examination of the record it appears that, in addition to various questions as to the merits of the controversy which are presented by the assignments of error, the jurisdiction of the circuit court is in issue. Under  5 and 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, writs of errors in such cases are to be taken direct to the \n\n[194 U.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court, and the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the circuit courts of appeal does not include such cases.\n\n'In accordance, therefore, with the practice indicated in Cincinnati, H. & D.

The complaint avers, and the answer admits, that defendant is a domestic corporation, duly organized and existing under the laws of New York, having its principal office for the transaction of business in the southern district of New York. The complaint further avers, and the answer admits, that 'plaintiff is a resident of the state of Delaware.' Upon the trial the plaintiff testified: 'I started in the printing business about thirty years ago. . . . I have been on the New York Tribune, on the World, the Philadelphia Record, and the American Press Association. . . . I had charge of the Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware. . . . In this city [New York] I worked on the New York Tribune, on the Sun, on the World, and in the American Press Association. . . . Just prior to my going to work upon the New York Sun [under the contract in suit] I was the publisher and business manager of the Evening Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and president of the company. . . . [After my discharge from the employ of the Sun] I finally secured a place with the New Haven Palladium, and I was there a while. . . . One of the reasons I left the New Haven Palladium was that it was too far away from home. I live in Delaware, and I had to go back and forth. My family were over in Delaware.' \n\n[194 U.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n 'There was no other testimony in any way bearing upon plaintiff's residence or citizenship.\n\n'The jurisdiction of the circuit court was not questioned by the defendant in the court below, and the assignments of error do not present any such question.\n\n Questions Certified.\n'Upon the facts above set forth, the question of law concerning which this court desires the instruction of the Supreme Court is:\n\n\"Had the circuit court jurisdiction of the controversy between plaintiff and defendant?'\n\n'In accordance with the provisions of  6 of the act of March 31, 1891, establishing courts of appeal, etc., the foregoing question of law is, by the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, hereby certified to the Supreme Court.'\n\n In the argument at bar on behalf of the Sun Printing & Publishing Association,-the plaintiff in error in the circuit court of appeals,-the jurisdiction of the circuit court over the controversy was denied, not only upon the hypothesis that Edwards, the plaintiff, was not alleged or shown to have been a citizen of Delaware, but also upon the assumption that the Sun Association was not averred to have been a citizen of New York. The latter contention may be at once dismissed from view, because the allegation of the complaint, admitted by the answer, 'that defendant is a domestic corporation, duly organized and existing under the laws of New York, having its principal office for the transaction of business in the southern district of New York,' clearly imported that the corporation was originally created by the state of New York. The presumption necessarily followed that the corporation was composed of citizens of that state, and consequently the corporation was entitled to sue or be sued in the courts of the United States as a citizen of New York. Southern R. Co. v. Allison, \n190 U.S. 326\n, 47 L. ed. 1078, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 713.\n We come to the contention that the citizenship of Edwards \n\n[194 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n was not averred in the complaint or shown by the record, and hence jurisdiction did not appear.\n In answering the question whether the circuit court had jurisdiction of the controversy, we must put ourselves in the place of the circuit court of appeals, and decide the question with reference to the transcript of record in that court.\n Had the transcript shown nothing more as to the statute of Edwards than the averment of the complaint that he was a 'resident of the state of Delaware,' as such an averment would not necessarily have imported that Edwards was a citizen of Delaware, a negative answer would have been impelled by prior decisions. Mexican C. R. Co. v. Duthie, \n189 U.S. 76\n, 47 L. ed. 715, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 610; Horne v. George H. Hammond Co. \n155 U.S. 393\n, 39 L. ed. 197, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167; Denny v. Pironi, \n141 U.S. 121\n, 35 L. ed. 657, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966; Robertson v. Cease, \n97 U.S. 646\n, 24 L. ed. 1057. The whole record, however, may be looked to, for the purpose of curing a defective averment of citizenship, where jurisdiction in a Federal court is asserted to depend upon diversity of citizenship, and if the requisite citizenship is anywhere expressly averred in the record, or facts are therein stated which, in legal intendment, constitute such allegation, that is sufficient. Horne v. George H. Hammond Co. \n155 U.S. 393\n, 39 L. ed. 197, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167, and cases cited.\n As this is an action at law, we are bound to assume that the testimony of the plaintiff contained in the certificate of the circuit court of appeals, and recited to have been given on the trial, was preserved in a bill of exceptions, which formed part of the transcript of record filed in the circuit court of appeals. Being a part of the record, and proper to be resorted to in settling a question of the character of that now under consideration (Robertson v. Cease, \n97 U.S. 648\n, 24 L. ed. 1058), we come to ascertain what is established by the uncontradicted evidence referred to.\n In the first place, it shows that Edwards, prior to his employment on the New York Sun and the New Haven Palladium, we legally domiciled in the state of Delaware. Next, it demonstrates that he had no intention to abandon such domicil, for he testified under oath as follows: 'One of the reasons I \n\n[194 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n left the New Haven Palladium was, it was too far away from home. I lived in Delaware, and I had to go back and forth. My family are over in Delaware.' Now, it is elementary that, to effect a change of one's legal domicil, two things are indispensable: First, residence in a new domicil; and, second, the intention to remain there. The change cannot be made, except facto et animo. Both are alike necessary. Either without the other is insufficient. Mere absence from a fixed home, however long continued, cannot work the change. Mitchell v. United States, 21 Wall. 353, 22 L. ed. 588.\n As Delaware must, then, be held to have been the legal domicil of Edwards at the time he commenced this action, had it appeared that he was a citizen of the United States, it would have resulted, by operation of the 14th Amendment, that Edwards was also a citizen of the state of Delaware. Anderson v. Watt, \n138 U.S. 702\n, 34 L. ed. 1081, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449. Be this as it may, however, Delaware being the legal domicil of Edwards, it was impossible for him to have been a citizen of another state, district, or territory; and he must then have been either a citizen of Delaware or a citizen or subject of a foreign state. In either of these contingencies, the circuit court would have had jurisdiction over the controversy. But, in the light of the testimony, we are satisfied that the averment in the complaint, that Edwards was a resident 'of' the state of Delaware, was intended to mean, and, reasonably construed, must be interpreted as averring, that the plaintiff was a citizen of the state of Delaware. Jones v. Andrews, 10 Wall. 331, 19 L. ed. 936; United States Exp. Co. v.

HAMMER(1904)\nNo. 238\nArgued: April 20, 1904Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lee Sale, Solomon L. Swarts, and Wolf & Cohen for appellant.\n Messrs. Herbert R. Marlatt, George S. Johnson, Charles A. Houts, and Harry B. Hawes for appellee.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case involves the validity of taxes imposed upon property in the hands of a trustee in bankruptcy.\n The appellant was duly elected and qualified as trustee of the estate of Siegel-Hillman Dry Goods Company, which had been adjudged a bankrupt. The appellant, as such trustee, had in his hands and on deposit in the designated depository the sum of $68,320, belonging to the estate. The appellee, as collector of the revenue of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, filed before the referee a petition alleging state, school, and city taxes for the year 1901 had been regularly assessed against said sum on the first of June, 1900, and that a bill for said taxes, properly certified, had been delivered to him for collection, and \n\n[194 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n prayed for an order directing the taxes to be paid. The trustee filed an answer denying the liability of the property to the taxes. After hearing, the referee made an order directing the appellant to pay to appellee the sum of $1,298.08, the amount of the tax bill for the year 1901, 'together with the accrued penalties and fees provided by laws.'\n The order was affirmed by the district court as to the amount of taxes, but disapproved as to accrued penalties and fees. A decree was duly entered, which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 56 C. C. A. 92, 120 Fed. 256.\n The argument of appellant has taken somewhat wide range. The case, however, is in narrow compass. The question is not the extent of the power of Congress over the subject of bankruptcy, but what Congress intended by the act of 1898. [30 Stat. at L. 548, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418.] By  7 of that act the title to all of the property of the bankrupt not declared to be exempt is vested in the trustee. By the transfer to the trustee no mysterious or peculiar ownership or qualities are given to the property. It is dedicated, it is true, to the payment of the creditors of the bankrupt, but there is nothing in that to withdraw it from the necessity of protection by the state and municipality or which should exempt it from its obligations to either. If Congress has the power to declare otherwise, and wished to do so, the intention would be clearly expressed, not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt. Though the opinion of the circuit court of appeals is brief, it is difficult to add anything to its conclusiveness. But, as showing the trend of judicial opinion, we may refer to Re Conhaim, 100 Fed. 268; Re Keller, 109 Fed. 131; Re Sims, 118 Fed. 356.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERRE HAUTE & I.

Hawkins, and Ferdinand Winter for defendant in error.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 579, 585]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the state of Indiana to ascertain and to recover from the plaintiff in error the total net profits made by the latter over 15 per cent on the true cost of construction of its railroad, from the time when the net earnings equalled that cost, with 10 per cent on the same added. The claim of the state was made under  23 of the charter of the railroad, approved January 26, 1847, and four acts of 1897, to be referred to. The complaint admits, and the answer sets up, a surrender on January 17, 1873, of the charter of 1847, on which the supposed obligation was based, and an acceptance of the general railroad law by the company, and also a judgment for the company in March, 1876, on a former complaint for the same cause. The answer also makes a general denial, and invokes the 14th Amendment and other relevant parts of the Constitution of the United States. The case was referred to a master, who ruled that the former judgment was not a bar, but ruled also that the company was not liable. The superior court ruled the other way, and gave judgment against the company for $913,905.01. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and the case then was brought here by writ of error.\n By  22 of the charter the railroad is given absolute discretion in the fixing of charges. Then, by  23: 'When the aggregate amount of dividends declared shall amount to the full sum invested and 10 per centum per annum thereon, the legislature may so regulate the tolls and freights that not more than 15 per centum per annum shall be divided on the capital employed, and the surplus profits, if any, after paying the expenses and receiving [reserving] such proportion as may be necessary for future contingencies, shall be paid over to the treasurer of state, for the use of common schools; but the cor- \n\n[194 U.S. 579, 586]\n\u00a0\n poration shall not be compelled by law to reduce the tolls and freights so that a dividend of 15 per centum per annum cannot be made; and it shall be the duty of the corporation to furnish the legislature, if required, with a correct statement of the amount of expenditures and the amount of profits, after deducting all expenses,' etc., By  24: Semiannual dividends of so much of the profits as the corporation may deem expedient are to be made, and 'the directors may retain such proportion of the profits as a contingent fund to meet subsequent expenses as they shall deem proper.' By  35, repealed in 1848, the corporation is to keep a fair record of the whole expense of making and repairing its tolls received, and the state is to have the right to purchase the stock of the company after twenty-five years for a sum equal, with the tolls received, to the cost and expenses of the railroad, with 10 per cent.\n The complaint relied also upon an amendment of  23, on February 24, 1897, attempting to make the above-mentioned surplus profits a debt, and to make the company accountable from the beginning of such profits. The complaint still further relied upon an act of January 27, 1897, requiring the railroad to account; as act of March 4, 1897, appropriating the net earnings of the company above 15 per cent, etc., as above, to the use of common schools, and authorizing a demand and a suit; and an amendment of the general railroad law on February 18, 1897, after the surrender of this company's charter, providing that all liabilities to the state, whether inchoate or complete, under special charter, were and should be reserved, notwithstanding the past or future acceptance of the surrender of such special charters.\n The supreme court, while agreeing that the right of the state must depend on the original charter, did give force to this later legislation, in terms, as providing a remedy, and, on the construction which we are compelled to give to the charter, did also give force in fact to the amendment to the provision attempting retrospectively to save the charter obligations after \n\n[194 U.S. 579, 587]\n\u00a0\n a surrender had been accepted. Therefore the question is properly here whether these statutes impaired the rights of the railroad under the Constitution of the United States. For, in order to determine whether the later legislation impairs those rights, this court must decide for itself what those rights were. If, in the opinion of this court, the state had lost all right to demand any sum whatever under  23 of the charter, legislation necessary to enforce such a demand is invalid, and may be pronounced so by this court, notwithstanding the fact that the cause of action now is based upon the original act. We shall recur to the question of our jurisdiction after discussing the merits of the case, which we must do to make what little we have to add plain.\n The supreme court of the state seems, although it is not clear, to have construed  23 as creating by itself alone a debt to the state which accrued as fast as surplus profits were realized, which, under that section, might have been required to be paid over to the treasurer of state. It is pointed out that in 1847 the state had no credit, and was in need of roads and schools, and that, therefore, it was natural to provide for the handing over of any surplus after a liberal return to the owners of the road. It is thought that the express grant of an absolute right to 15 per cent negatives the right to more, that the provisions for an account in  23 and 35, and the mandatory language as to the surplus, confirm this result, and that it is unreasonable to suppose that the legislature, after indicating what, by the agreement of the parties, would be a fair demand of the state, should leave the right of the state in abeyance until a future legislature should choose to act. In this way the amendment of  23 in 1897 is practically carried into effect. While repudiated as legislation, it is adopted by construction, and is found to express only the meaning of the original act.\n We are driven to a different construction of the charter, notwithstanding the deference naturally felt for the decision of a state court upon state laws. The language is plain. The \n\n[194 U.S. 579, 588]\n\u00a0\n legislature 'may so' regulate tolls 'that' not more than 15 per cent shall be divided, 'and' the surplus profit shall be paid over. The word 'may,' it is agreed, is permissive, not mandatory. In the next place, it is only upon its regulation of tolls, so that not more than 15 per cent shall be divided, that dividends are confined to that sum. Otherwise the general power, given by  24, to declare such dividends as the company deems expedient, remains in force. Finally, the payment over of the surplus profits above 15 per cent is not separate, independent, and absolute mandate, but is connected with 'so regulate tolls that' by 'and.' Like the cutting down of dividends, it is a result of the regulation. Again, the duty of the corporation to furnish the legislature a statement of expenditures is only 'if required.' It might be required in order to be certain whether it was advisable to regulate tolls. Perhaps, if the legislature had regulated them, it might be required in order to find out what was due. The provision for a record and an account in the repealed  35 seems to us to have little bearing. They were required there, primarily at least, with reference to the possible purchase of the stock by the state. We infer that the state courts considered the words 'regulate tolls' to refer solely to fixing the amount to be charged, and regarded the payment over of the surplus as an independent mandate. It seems to us that the words as here used meant more, and embraced not only fixing the amount to be charged to the public, but an order for the division of earnings between the railroad and the schools. The provision as to the surplus over 15 per cent is not sufficiently accounted for if the regulation of tolls is intended to make the profits as near 15 per cent as may be.\n Not only the absolute discretion as to dividends given by  24, but the similar discretion given by the same section as to the proportion of profits to be retained, confirms the grammatical construction of  23. Circumstances might change, and knowledge might change. It is agreed that they did not know much about railroads in 1847. The corporation \n\n[194 U.S. 579, 589]\n\u00a0\n was allowed to make and to distribute or retain such earnings as it could, subject to the power of the state in certain events to require it to pay over extra profits, or to sell its stock. But which, and whether the state would make either demand, was left undecided; and, until the state elected, the whole earnings of the company were its own.\n It follows that when the company surrendered its charter in 1873, there having been no attempt by the state to regulate tolls before that time, the company was free from liability or the possibility of demand. Therefore it is only by attempting, as it did attempt in its complaint, to apply the subsequent amendment of the general railroad law, that the state can come into court. That law, it will be remembered, purported retrospectively to save rights under surrendered charters. It does not need argument to show that this amendment could not affect the plaintiff.\n The case then stands thus: The state court has sustained a result which cannot be reached, except on what we deem a wrong construction of the charter, without relying on unconstitutional legislation. It clearly did rely upon that legislation to some extent, but exactly how far is left obscure. We are of opinion that we cannot decline jurisdiction of a case which certainly never would have been brought but for the passage of flagrantly unconstitutional laws, because the state court put forward the untenable construction more than the unconstitutional statutes in its judgment. To hold otherwise would open an easy method of avoiding the jurisdiction of this court. Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens' Gaslight Co. \n115 \nU.S. 683, 697\n, 29 S. L. ed. 510, 516, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265. We may add that it is admitted that one of the acts of 1897 was necessary to authorize a demand, and so to create a cause of action. It was for want of an authorized demand that the former suit was held no bar. But in our opinion the state had no right, in 1897, to make a demand.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P. R. CO. v.

Swearingen, the defendant in error, and, on the application of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, was removed to the circuit court of the United States as one arising under the laws of the United States, because the railway company was chartered under an act of Congress.\n The action was to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by reason of the alleged negligence of the defendant company, in whose service at the time of the injury the plaintiff was employed as a switchman. The negligence alleged on the part of the company was the existence, in close proximity to a switch track, of a scale box, by striking against which the plaintiff was injured whilst doing duty as a switchman. In addition to a general denial the railway company specially pleaded that the scale box in question was at a safe distance from the track on which the plaintiff was hurt when working, and, moreover, that the plaintiff had assumed the risk, if any, arising from the situation of the scale box, and had, in any event, been guilty of contributory negligence. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and an affirmance of such judgment by the court of appeals. 59 C. C. A. 31, 122 Fed. 193.\n The assignments of error are based, first, on a ruling of the trial court in rejecting evidence; second, on the refusal to direct a verdict; and, third, on an exception taken to the charge \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n given to the jury. To pass upon them requires an appreciation of the proof, and therefore, before coming to consider the assignments, we summarize the testimony.\n The accident occurred after dark on the evening of February 7, 1902, in the switch yards at El Paso. It was shown that in that yard there were several tracks. One track, No. 1, ran over the bed of the scales in question. On the right of this scale there was what was called a scale box, which rose to about the height of 6 feet, and was about 5 feet wide and 18 inches deep. On the other side of this structure there was a track described as track No. 2, and beyond this, to the right, were two other tracks, known respectively as track No. 3 and track No. 4. The space between a ladder on the side of a freight car when moving on track No. 2 and the scale box in question was shown by the evidence to be only 19 1\/2 inches.\n The plaintiff testified concerning the accident as follows:\n'I was hurt on the evening of the 7th of February, 1902, while working as a switchman after dark, at about 6 o'clock and 45 minutes.\n\n'I was a day switchman, but we worked until after dark.\n\n'My duties as a switchman was to assist in the moving, placing, and switchimg of cars, coupling and uncoupling them, and making up trains, and generally to obey the order of Yardmaster Moore, under whom we were working, and my duties also required me to ride on the cars while they were being moved.\n\n'On this night we were making up a transfer to take to the Southern Pacific Railway, and the cars we had to get were on No. 2 track. My station was with the engine, called 'following the engine.' I worked up near the engine.\n\n'The engine was at the west end of the yards, west of track No. 2, with me with it, and it backed down east into No. 2 track, with me riding on the footboard at the east end of the engine, to get these cars, and we passed the scale box, although I did not see it, and reaching the cars I coupled the engine to them, and not getting a signal from the yardmaster, who was still \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n farther east of me, as was also the other switchman, Williams, I walked east down the string of cars about two car lengths, and getting the signal I passed the same to the engineer, and the engine and cars started up again going west so as to go out on another track, and as the cars started I got up on a box car to ride down past the switch at the west end of track No. 2, so as to throw the switch and let the train on another track.\n\n'There is a ladder on the side of a box car, and a step called a stirrup under the ladder under the bottom of the car, and I was holding on to the ladder with my hands [illustrating by holding his hands above his head, as if climbing a ladder], and my lantern was hanging on my right arm, and I was looking back east for a signal from the yardmaster, as it is my duty to do, I do not know whether he wanted to give one or not, but it is my duty to be on the lookout, although I do not have to look in his direction all the time, when my right shoulder struck the scale box, and I fell down between the scale box and the cars, and I was dragged and badly injured. We had probably eight or ten cars at the time, and I was riding properly and hanging out a little from the car, which is proper, and I was on the north side of the car, which is also proper, so as to signal the engineer.'\n\n The employee who built the scales testified as follows:\n'It is my business to know how much a car passing on a side track will clear the scale box, and these tracks at this place are standard gauge apart, and the scale box is standard, and as I had to put the scale box there to facilitate business and for convenience, I had no more room because the lever of the scale is a certain length to get the fulcrum. The tracks are standard, and are not further apart because there is no more room to put them farther apart.\n\n ... * *\n'The distance that I put this scale box from track No. 2 is standard, and is considered a safe and proper distance in putting in scales where the tracks are standard gauge apart.\n\n ... * * \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n 'I am bound to put my scales in according to the length of the lever, and if tracks are already there and are standard distance apart I have a uniform and standard distance from the tracks.\n'We have side tracks at most places on each side of the scales. The tracks in this yard are standard gauge apart, and where ground is scarce we have to economize in space; but where ground is plenty the tracks can be further apart.'\n\n The evidence for the company also showed that the scales in question had been erected a number of years prior to the happening of the accident and after tracks Nos. 1 and 2 were built. The superintendent of terminals of the defendant company testified that 'south of track No. 4 there is a space left for four or five more tracks.' The same witness also stated that the customary position of a switchman while riding on a car and ladder 'is to swing out from the car with his body,' and that 'a well- developed man cannot safely pass by the scale box on track No. 2, while riding on a side of a car on the ladder, if he hangs out from the car.'\n There was evidence that at other yards than the one in question the distances from the side of a standard box car to adjoining scale boxes varied from 16 inches to 168 inches.\n Testimony was introduced tending to show that the plaintiff, before he was hurt, knew of the proximity of the scale box to track No. 2. Concerning his employment and knowledge of the location of the scales, plaintiff testified that he had made one trip as extra brakeman in the service of the railway company in January, 1900; that in December, 1901, as brakeman, he made about one trip between El Paso and Toyah; that he had worked in the El Paso yards as extra switchman two nights and three days in January, 1902, and went to work there regularly as switchman on February 1, 1902. He denied any recollection of ever having worked on track No. 2 during his employment in January, 1902, and, referring to his employment in the early days of February, 1902, plaintiff says: \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n 'During the seven days I worked for defendant we never used this No. 2 track at the west end, or near the scales, and I never saw a car on track No. 2, opposite the scales, and never had my attention called to the distance between the track and scale box. I never measured or approximated the distance to it. Nothing ever occurred to attract my attention to it.\n ... * *\n'I knew we had to pass the scale box at the time I was hurt, so as to get to the switch beyond, but I was not thinking about it, and I did not see it when we passed it going in after these cars.\n\n'The switch engine had a headlight lighted at both ends, and I was on the footboard at the rear of the engine, which put me in front while we were backing into track No. 2 after the cars, but the headlights were not very clean or bright.\n\n'There was nothing to hide the scale box from my view; it was perfectly open and apparent.'\n\n Plaintiff further testified:\n'I knew the location of the scale before I was hurt. I knew it was between tracks Nos. 1 and 2, but I did not know anything with reference to its proximity to track No. 2, and did not know it was dangerously close to track No. 2.\n\n'At the time I was hurt, I had no knowledge of the distance between the scale box and No. 2 track.\n\n'I set cars on the scale on track No. 1 to be weighed, but I would be on the north side of the cars on track No. 1, and as the scale box is on the south side I could not see it. I had nothing to do with the scale box and had no business around it.\n\n'I first learned the exact distance between the scale box and the nearest rail of track No. 2 a few days ago, when I went down and measured it at your (referring to plaintiff's attorney) recommendation.\n\n'I was never warned about the danger of getting knocked off of cars by this scale box, and at the time I was hurt I \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n was attending to my work, and thinking about my duties, and looking for a signal from the yardmaster, and was not thinking about the box. I did not see it immediately prior to the time I struck it.\n\n'The scale box was at the same place, when I struck it, as it was when I first went to work for defendant.'\n\n The evidence was closed by the offer on behalf of the company of portions of a written application by plaintiff for employment as brakeman, dated February 22, 1900. After stating that the plaintiff identified the application, the bill of exceptions recites as follows:\n'Defendant then offered in evidence the following portions of said application, consisting of questions and the answers thereto written by the plaintiff, for the purpose of showing that plaintiff had notice of the location of said track scale box, and that he was in danger of being knocked off of a car when passing the same:\n\n Q. 'Do you make this application for employment in train service, realizing the hazardous nature of such employment, understanding that it is necessary in operating this railway for the company to have overhead and truss bridges at certain points on the line; also coal chutes, track scale boxes, water tanks, coal houses, platforms, sheds, roofs, and other overhead and side structures, and that in performance of the duties for which you are employed you are liable to receive injuries by being knocked off the side or top of cars unless you use due care to avoid injury thereby?'\n'A. 'Yes.'\n\n'Q. 'Do you agree to acquaint yourself with the location of all overhead and truss bridges, as well as the location of all other structures along the line of the road?'\n\n'A. 'Yes.'\n\n'Q. 'Do you understand that no officer or employee of this company is authorized to request or require you to use defective tracks, cars, machinery, or appliances of any kind, and that when you do so you assume all risk of injury therefrom?' \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n 'A. 'Yes.'\n\n'Q. 'Do you understand that this company desires to employ only experienced men in the service, and does not undertake to educate inexperienced men?'\n\n'A. 'Yes.'\n\n'Counsel for plaintiff objected to the said testimony for the reason that it was irrelevant and immaterial, and that plaintiff had made this application and entered the employ of defendant, and afterwards resigned, and again entered the employ of the defendant some two years later, without making another application, and also because it was an effort on the part of defendant to limit its liability for its own negligence, and void, as against public policy, and because the particular location of this track scale box is not given; and the court having sustained plaintiff's objections, and excluded said testimony, the defendant then and there excepted to the action of the court in excluding said evidence, and tenders this, its bill of exceptions, which is allowed, signed, and sealed by the court.'\n\n The first assignment of error assails the affirmance by the court of appeals of the action of the trial court in refusing to receive in evidence the matter just referred to.\n These excerpts were offered in evidence, as stated in the bill of exceptions, 'for the purpose of showing that plaintiff had notice of the location of said track scale box, and that he was in danger of being knocked off a car when passing the same.'\n The application was made in February, 1900, and was for employment, not as switchman, but as brakeman. The employment of the plaintiff with the defendant company following the application was in December, 1901, when the plaintiff, as a brakeman, made about a dozen trips between El Paso and a place called Toyah. His subsequent employment as switchman commenced but a short time before the happening, in February, 1902, of the accident complained of.\n We think the trial court rightly excluded the offered evidence. In the first place, the plaintiff had testified that \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 60]\n\u00a0\n before the accident he had knowledge of the existence of the scale box. In the next place, while undoubtedly the statements in the application tended to show that the plaintiff was aware of the generally hazardous nature of the employment, and necessity of the exercise of care in working with and about the instrumentalities employed by the company in the operation of its railroad, the recognition of these facts by the plaintiff, and his agreement to acquaint himself with the location of bridges and other structures on the line of the road, did not tend to establish notice, communicated to the plaintiff, that the defendant company had not exercised due care in placing scales or scale boxes on its tracks, or that the company had, by its negligence, increased the ordinary hazards to be expected from the use of such structures, and that, by the exercise of ordinary care on his part, planintiff could not escape injury. The evidence was therefore immaterial in the light of the issue upon which the jury had to pass.\n At the close of all the evidence the defendant company requested the court to charge the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, and to the overruling of such motion the defendant company duly excepted. The second assignment alleges error in the affirmance by the court of appeals of the action of the trial court denying this motion.\n The right to have the jury instructed to find for the company was based upon the following contention:\n'a. Because the undisputed evidence established that said track scale box was erected in the defendant's yard, and, under the circumstances, in a reasonably safe place, and at a reasonably safe distance and location from track No. 2, on which track plaintiff was riding at the time he was injured.\n\n'b. Because plaintiff testified he knew of the location of the track scale box and the location of track No. 2 with reference to said track scale box, on which track No. 2 he was riding at the time he was hurt, and because the undisputed evidence shows that the track scale box and the danger of the same was open and obvious to the view of plaintiff, and that neither \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 61]\n\u00a0\n the track scale box nor the dangers thereof were hidden or latent, and plaintiff was presumed to know the danger, and assumed the risks thereof.\n\n'c. Because the uncontroverted testimony established the fact that plaintiff knew of the location of the track scale box, and location of said track No. 2 with reference to said track scale box, on which track he was riding at the time he was hurt, and that the track scale box and the dangers of the same were open and obvious to the view of plaintiff, and not hidden or latent, and plaintiff was presumed to know the danger, and assumed the risk.'\n\n The motion was properly overruled. So far from it being the fact, as asserted, that the evidence established indisputably the existence of the grounds upon which the motion was based, the record shows that there was evidence tending to establish that the track scale box was not erected in a reasonably safe place, and that, although the plaintiff knew that the scale box was situated adjacent to track No. 2, he did not know that it was so near that it could not be passed, in the performance of his duties as a switchman, without danger. This is apparent when it is borne in mind that the plaintiff testified, in substance, that prior to the accident he had not closely inspected the scale box or taken measurements of the distance from the box to the north rail of track No. 2, and that he did not do more than cursorily observe the structure from a distance, and that he was unaware of the nearness of the scale box to the north rail of track No. 2.\n Prima facie, the location of scales where the tracks were only the standard distance apart, and where a space of less than 2 feet was left for the movements of a switchman between the side of a freight car and the scale box, encumbered, as he would be in the nighttime, with a lantern employed for the purpose of signaling, did not incontestably establish the performance by the defendant company of the duty imposed upon it to use due care to provide a reasonably safe place for the use of the switchmen in its employ. And so far from the \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 62]\n\u00a0\n proof making it certain that the necessity of the situation required the erection of the structure between tracks Nos. 1 and 2 as existing, there was proof that the railway company owned unoccupied ground, intended for other tracks, to the south of track No. 4, justifying the inference that the distance between tracks Nos. 1 and 2 might have been increased, and the employment of the scales thus rendered less hazardous to switchmen, or that the scales might have been removed to a safer location.\n It was, therefore, properly a question for the determination of the jury whether or not the scales were maintained in a reasonably safe place, and if not, whether the plaintiff had notice thereof. The court of appeals was of opinion, and rightly we think, that the dangerous contiguity of the scale box to track No. 2, and the extra hazard to switchmen resulting therefrom, was not so open and obvious on other than a close inspection, as to justify taking from the jury the determination of the question whether there had been an assumption of the risk. The plaintiff was entitled to assume that the defendant company had used due care to provide a reasonably safe place for the doing by him of the work for which he had been employed, and as the fact that the defendant company might not have performed such duty in respect to the scale box in question was not so patent as to be readily observable, the court could not declare, in view of the testimony of the plaintiff as to his actual want of knowledge of the danger, that he had assumed the hazard incident to the actual situation. Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 48 S., L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24.\n The remaining assignment of error questions the correctness of the following portion of the charge to the jury:\n'The defendant claims that the plaintiff knew of the existence and location of the scale box with which he came in contact, and that, by continuing in the work, with such knowledge, he assumed all risks incident to and arising out of his employment. Upon this point you are instructed that, if you believe \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 63]\n\u00a0\n from the testimony that prior to the plaintiff's injuries he knew of the existence and location of the scale box, and of the danger incident to the discharge of his duties while passing the same on a moving train, if danger there was; or if, knowing of the location of the structure, the danger to the employees while in the usual discharge of their duties was apparent, that is, open to observation,-then you are instructed that the plaintiff, by continuing in the employment of the defendant without complaint, assumed such risks, and he would not, therefore, be entitled to recover. In this connection you are further instructed that the mere fact that the plaintiff knew of the existence and location of the scale box would not, as a matter of law, charge him with knowledge of the danger, if such danger there was, due to its proximity to the north rail of track No. 2, and whether he knew of the danger is a question of fact for you to determine from a consideration of all the facts and circumstances in evidence.'\n\n The grounds of the objection to the charge being thus stated:\n'Because the proof showed that plaintiff knew of the location of the track scale box, and of track No. 2, on which he was riding at the time he was hurt, in reference to a scale box, and that the same and the location thereof was open and obvious to plaintiff's view, and, being an experienced brakeman, he was charged with notice that riding on the cars as he did was dangerous, and he assumed the risks thereof, and the court should have so charged the jury.'\n\n This assignment but reiterates contentions made in connection with the assignment based on the alleged error in overruling the motion for judgment. As we have already decided that knowledge of the increased hazard resulting from the dangerous proximity of the scale box to the north rail of track No. 2 could not be imputed to the plaintiff simply because he was aware of the existence and general location of the scale box, it was for the jury to determine, from a consideration of all the facts and circumstances in evidence, whether plaintiff had actual knowledge of the danger. \n\n[196 U.S. 51, 64]\n\u00a0\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE IROQUOIS(1904)\nNo. 200\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a libel filed in the district court for the northern district of California by Matthew Bridges against the ship Iroquois, to recover damages for a failure of the master to provide suitable surgical treatment and care for the libellant, who had suffered injury by a fall from the main yard to the deck of the vessel.\n The facts of the case were substantially as follows: The Iroquois left New York on December 27, 1899, bound for the port of San Francisco, with a full cargo of general merchandise. On February 23, 1900, while the vessel was rounding Cape Horn during heavy weather, and while libellant was aloft, in the performance of his duty, he accidentally fell from the main yard to the deck of the vessel, thereby fracturing two ribs and his right leg in two places. The master, with the aid of the carpenter, set the leg in splints, kept the libellant in his berth, gave him such food and delicacies as the supplies of the ship permitted, and on March 30, after five weeks, removed the splints, and found the leg apparently in good condition. Before arriving at San Francisco, and early in April, he was able to leave his berth, go upon deck and walk about with the aid of \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n a crutch. But after arriving at that port on May 7, 1900, he was sent to the hospital, where it was found that, while his ribs had healed perfectly, the bones of his leg had not united, and he was subsequently, and in October, compelled to suffer amputation, and, of course, became a cripple for the remainder of his life. The master was charged with a breach of duty in failing to put into an intermediate port and procure the proper surgical attendance.\n Upon this state of facts the district court entered a decree in favor of the libellant for $3,000 (113 Fed. 964), which was subsequently affirmed by the court of appeals, 55 C. C. A. 497, 118 Fed. 1003\n\n\n Mr. Milton Andros for petitioners.\n Messrs. A. H. Ricketts, Walter G. Holmes, and D. T. Sullivan, for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n The duty to provide proper medical treatment and attendance for seamen falling ill or suffering injury the service of the ship has been imposed upon the shipowners by all maritime \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n nations. It appears in the earliest Codes of Continental Europe and was expressly recognized by this court in the recent case of The Osceola, \n189 U.S. 158\n, 47 L. ed. 760, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 483. Upon large passenger steamers a physician or surgeon is always employed, whose duty it is to minister to the passengers and crew in cases of sickness or accident. Of course, this would be impracticable upon an ordinary freighting vessel, where the master is presumed to have some knowledge of the treatment of diseases, and in ordinary cases stands in the place of a physician or surgeon (The Wensleydale, 41 Fed. 602); but for the further protection of seamen, vessels of the class of the Iroquois are compelled by law to be provided with a chest of medicines and with such anti-scorbutics, clothing, and slop-chests as the climate, particular trade, and the length of the voyage may require. U. S. Rev. Stat.  4569, 4572, 4573 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3100 3101).\n What is the measure of the master's obligation in cases where the seaman is severely injured while the ship is at sea has been made the subject of discussion in several cases; but each depends so largely upon its own peculiar facts that the rule laid down in one may afford little or no aid in determining another, depending upon a different state of facts. The early cases of Harden v. Gordon, 2 Mason, 541, Fed. Cas. No. 6,047 and Reed v. Canfield, Sumn. 195, Fed. Cas. No. 11641, contain an exhaustive discussion of the general subject by Mr. Justice Story. But, as in both cases the disability occurred at or near a port, they are of no special value in this case.\n We have carefully examined the cases of Brown v. Overton, 1 Sprague, 462, Fed. Cas. No. 2,024; The Chandos, 6 Sawy. 544, 4 Fed. 647; The Scotland, 42 Fed. 925; Whitney v. Olsen, 47 C. C. A. 331, 108 Fed. 292; The Troop, 118 Fed. 769, and Danvir v. Morse, 139 Mass. 323, 1 N. E. 123, and are of opinion that none of them fit the exigencies of the present case. We cannot say that in every instance where a serious accident occurs the master is bound to disregard every other consideration and put into the nearest port, though if the accident happen within a reasonable distance of such port, his duty to do so would be manifest. \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n Each case must depend upon its own circumstances, having reference to the seriousness of the injury, the care that can be given the sailor on shipboard, the proximity of an intermediate port, the consequences of delay to the interests of the shipowner, the direction of the wind and the probability of its continuing in the same direction, and the fact whether a surgeon is likely to be found with competent skill to take charge of the case. With reference to putting into port, all that can be demanded of the master is the exercise of reasonable judgment and the ordinary acquaintance of a seaman with the geography and resources of the country. He is not absolutely bound to put into such port if the cargo be such as would be seriously injured by the delay. Even the claims of humanity must be weighed in a balance with the loss that would probably occur to the owners of the ship and cargo. A seafaring life is a dangerous one, accidents of this kind are peculiarly liable to occur, and the general principle of law that a person entering a dangerous employment is regarded as assuming the ordinary risks of such employment is peculiarly applicable to the case of seamen.\n To judge of the propriety of the master's conduct in a particular case we are bound, so far as possible, to put ourselves in his place, and inquire whether, in view of all the circumstances, he was bound to put into an intermediate port. The charge in the libel is that he should either have put back to Port Stanley in the East Falkland islands, or deviated from his course and made the port of Valparaiso, 'or any one of several other ports in the southern part of South America.' The very indefiniteness of this charge shows that neither libellant nor counsel had in mind any particular port, and it was not until the testimony of a former officer of the Chilian navy was taken at San Francisco, that they were able to fix upon the port of San Carlos or the Evangelist islands as proper places at which to make call. In view of this inability to select a proper port until the officer whose business it had been to cruise up and down the Chilian coast had informed them, it may certainly be contended \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n with great show of reason that the master was not bound to know of the existence of these ports, except as he was informed by the chart, or of the possibility of obtaining surgical treatment at them. While masters plying upon vessels between New York and Pacific ports would be presumed to know of such familiar harbors as those of Port Stanley and Valparaiso, it by no means follows that they are chargeable with knowledge of every port upon the southwest coast of South America, or of their surgical facilities. The accident occurred upon one of the loneliest and most tempestous seas in the world. For over 1000 miles from Cape Horn to Valparaiso there seem to have been but one or two places at which it would be feasible to make a call. The evidence shows that the ship at the time was about 480 miles from Port Stanley, and with the winds then prevailing it would have been possible to reach that port in three or four days; but that to return to the place of the accident, in view of the head winds, might have taken as many weeks. During this time the owners of the ship would sustain a heavy loss in the wages and provisions of the crew, and the demurrage of the ship, and while the cargo is not shown to have been perishable, there would be a risk of the loss of a market by the consequent delay in reaching San Francisco. The master is not chargeable with fault in failing to put back to Port Stanley.\n It was also suggested that the ship could have made the Evangelist islands, at the western end of the Straits of Magellan, by sailing one or two days out of her course; but it was shown that the only building there was a lighthouse, from which a small steamer was accustomed to put out to passing vessels in case a signal for relief was hoisted, and that nothing could be done there, except possibly to place the seaman upon a steamer bound north to Valparaiso or east to Sandy Point, near the middle of the straits. The probability of obtaining aid by this course, and the certainty of the limb being injured by the delay, would have made it highly inadvisable to adopt it. As there is no harbor in the islands, the various transfers \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n from the ship to a boat and from the boat to shore, and the return to another ship in the rough water that might be expected at that point, would have been extremely dangerous to a person in libellant's crippled condition. The transfer of passengers from a ship to a boat, even in a moderate sea, is attended with considerable difficulty, and, to a person with a broken leg, with great danger, in view of the unequal rising and falling of a large ship and a small boat. Had the master adopted this course and injury had resulted to the libellant, he could hardly have escaped the imputation of negligence.\n The libellant contended in his brief that, assuming that the master was not in fault for failing to stop at the Evangelist islands, he should have put in at the port of San Carlos or Ancud, which lie near together, where it seems there is a good harbor, a city of 15,000 or 20,000 inhabitants, and ample surgical facilities. We are not impressed with the force of this argument. These are not harbors at which vessels from the Atlantic and Pacific ports are in the habit of stopping. While the master was apprised by his charts of their existence, it might well be that he was ignorant of the population and of the accommodations for disabled seamen. There was no American consul there, and quite possibly no one familiar with the English language. To convict the captain of negligence for not calling there it must be shown that he knew, or should have known, that the libellant could obtain proper treatment. In short, the suggestion of these ports appears to have been purely an afterthought, inspired by the testimony of the Chilian officer.\n With respect to Valparaiso, the case is different. This port appears to be about 1,500 miles from the place of the accident, and, with favorable winds, could have been reached in fourteen days. It is true that the direct course from Cape Horn to San Francisco passes Valparaiso at a distance of about 600 miles; but the testimony all shows that if the Iroquois had borne away and hugged the South American coast she might have put into \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 246]\n\u00a0\n Valparaiso, left the libellant there, and resumed her course without more than five or six days' detention. Valparaiso is a large city, with ample hospital facilities, and with an American consul general resident there.\n We have no criticism to make of the treatment of libellant immediately following the injury, except that we think he should have been taken into the cabin, where he could have been more comfortably provided for. His leg was put in splints as well as the master and carpenter knew how to do it; he was kept to his berth in the forecastle, and was fed with such delicacies as the ship's supplies afforded. No fever set in, and when the splints were taken off, about five weeks after the accident, and after the vessel had passed Valparaiso, the leg was found to be in good condition, except for certain sores which had broken out upon it, caused by the long confinement in splints. It is true the libellant said the bones were not united, but he does not seem to have complained of this to the master; yet with a careful examination, such as the master was bound to make, we think he should have detected it. It may be, however, that the bones failed to unite by reason of the libellant being allowed to go upon deck and walk about on crutches. But however this may be, it was admitted that when the splints were taken off the vessel was about as near San Francisco as Valparaiso, and that nothing would have been gained by turning about at that time.\n The real question in the case is: whether the master, knowing his ignorance of surgery, the serious nature of the libellant's injury, the poor accommodations for him in the forecastle, the liability of inflammation setting in, and of the bones not uniting, the fact that he was to be carried through the tropics, where, to an invalid confined in the forecastle the heat would be almost intolerable, he should not, even at the sacrifice of a week, have put into Valparaiso and left the libellant there in charge of the American consul. Upon the other hand: libellant made no complaint of his treatment; did not ask to be taken into an intermediate port, and, so far as appears, the master \n\n[194 U.S. 240, 247]\n\u00a0\n did not know that the wound was not hearing properly. The fact that the ribs had already united probably induced him to believe that the leg had also healed, although a careful examination could not have failed to reveal the truth. We lay no stress upon the fact that the libellant did not ask to be taken into an intermediate port. He was a boy, largely ignorant of his rights and duties. The master was his legal guardian in the sense that it is a part of his duty to look out for the safety and care of his seamen, whether they make a distinct request for it or not. If, on arriving at Valparaiso the bones were found not to have knitted together, there was at least a chance of securing their union by proper treatment. If, upon the other hand, they had united, there was a certainty of securing ultimate recovery by careful nursing, and by the use of facilities which the hospital undoubtedly would have, and which the ship undoubtedly had not. To put it in a light most favorable to the master, he speculated upon the chance that the union of the bones had taken place, without seeking to inform himself of the fact. The courts below held that the master did not discharge, as he should have done, the claim of humanity which the serious nature of the injury and the helpless condition of the libellant imposed upon him.\n Upon the whole, while the case is by no means free from doubt, we are not disposed to disturb the decree of the court below in holding it to have been the duty of the master to put into an intermediate port. We regard the case as peculiarly one for the application of the general rule so often announced by this court, both in equity and admiralty cases, that this court will not reverse the concurring decisions of two subordinate courts upon questions of fact, unless there be a clear preponderance of evidence against their conclusions.

BUFFALO GERMAN INS CO(1904)\nNo. 146\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 581, 582]\n\u00a0\n The Third National Bank of Buffalo, spoken of hereafter as the bank, was organized on the 9th of February, 1865, and its articles of association contained the following:\n'That the board of directors shall have power to make all by-laws that may be proper and convenient for them to make under said act for the general regulation of the business of the association and the management and administration of its affairs, which by-laws may prohibit, if the directors shall so determine, the transfer of stock owned by any stockholder who may be liable to the association either as principal debtor or otherwise, without the consent of the board.'\n\n In virtue of the authority assumed to be conferred by the foregoing provision, the board of directors adopted in February, 1865, a by-law as follows:\n'Transfers of Stock.-Sec. 15. The stock of this bank shall be assignable only on the books of this bank, subject to the restrictions and provisions of the act, and a transfer book shall be kept in which all assignments and transfers of stock shall be made. No transfers of the stock of this association shall be made, without the consent of the board of directors, by any stockholder who shall be liable to the association either as principal debtor or otherwise, which liability shall be a lien upon the said stock and all the profits thereof, and dividends and certificates of stock shall contain upon them notice of this provision.'\n\n Pursuant to this by-law the stock certificates of the bank were thus framed:\n'This is to certify that _____ is the owner of _____ shares of $100 each of the capital stock of the Third National Bank of Buffalo, subject to the lien or liens referred to in  15 of the by-laws of said bank, in the following words: 'No transfer of the stock of this association shall be made without the consent of the board of directors, by any \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 583]\n\u00a0\n stockholder who shall be liable to the association either as principal debtor or otherwise, which liability shall be a lien upon the said stock and all profits thereof and dividends.' And the said stock is transferable only on the books of the bank by him or his attorney on the surrender and cancelation of this certificate and compliance with the said by-laws.'\n\n Emmanuel Levi became the registered holder and owner of 450 shares of the capital stock, evidenced by certificates in the form just stated. Levi borrowed money from the bank upon his promissory notes, secured by various collaterals. On the first day of October, 1890, he applied for a further loan, which the bank agreed to make, provided the new loan was indorsed by Louis Levi, a son of Emmanuel. At that time, in a conversation between the president of the bank and Levi, it was understood that all the stock held by Levi in the bank should be considered as additional security for his entire loan. When this conversation took place, however, the certificates evidencing Levi's stock were in his possession, and no formal pledge or subsequent delivery of the certificates of stock to the bank took place.\n A few months after (on December 3, 1890), Emmanuel Levi borrowed $25, 000 from the Buffalo German Insurance Company, hereafter spoken of as the insurance company, and secured this loan by pledging, delivering, and assigning to the insurance company his certificates of stock in the bank. The written contract of pledge gave the insurance company power, in default of payment of the loan at its maturity, to sell the stock at public or private sale after notice and apply the proceeds to the debt. On August 13, 1891, and on May 5, 1892, Levi borrowed additional sums from the insurance company and secured these loans by a pledge and assignment of his remaining stock in the bank. These contracts of pledge also contained a power of sale similar to that conferred by the first contract. In June, 1893, Emmanuel Levi died, and Louis and Rosa Levi were appointed and qualified as his executors. On the 9th of June, 1896, there was due to the insurance \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n company on the notes of Levi, secured by the pledge of his stock as above stated, the sum of $55,000 of principal, with certain unpaid interest. On that date the insurance company served upon the executors of the estate of Levi a demand for the payment of the debt, accompanied with a notice that if payment were not made the stock would be sold and the proceeds applied to the debt. Payment not having been made, after adequate notice, the attorneys for the bank, the attorneys of the executors of Levi, and one of the executors being present, the stock was sold at public auction, and was bought by the insurance company for the sum of $44,000, that being the highest bid offered. The insurance company thereupon presented to the bank the certificates of stock, the assignment thereof, and the evidence of the purchase at auction, and demanded a transfer to its name. This the bank refused on the ground of Levi's indebtedness to it. Subsequently the insurance company filed its bill, praying that the bank be decreed to transfer the stock and pay the dividends which had accrued thereon since the date of the demand to transfer. The bank, by its answer, set up the debt due by Levi to it, asserting that under the provision of its articles of association and by-laws, as well as under the terms of the certificates of stock and the agreement with Levi, it had the right to apply the dividends on the stock, accrued since the purchase by the insurance company, to its debt, and, indeed, having a prior lien upon the stock for its debt, had the right to withhold the transfer of the stock until the debt due it by Levi or his estate was paid. There was a decree in the trial court in favor of the bank. The case was appealed by the insurance company to the appellate division of the supreme court, fourth department, in which court the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. 29 App. Div. 137, 51 N. Y. Supp. 667. The insurance company prosecuted its appeal to the court of appeals of the state of New York, and in that court the judgments below were reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. 162 N. Y. 168, 48 L. R. A. 107, 56 N. E. 521. The cause was again tried and resulted in a decree in favor of the insur- \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 585]\n\u00a0\n ance company in both the trial court and the appellate division of the supreme court, and these judgments were affirmed by the court of appeals on the authority of its previous opinion. It is to review such decree of affirmance that this writ of error is prosecuted.\n Messrs. Adelbert Moot and George L. Lewis for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 581, 587]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur W. Hickman for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is obvious that the bank had no lien on the stock of Levi \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 588]\n\u00a0\n as the result of an express contract of pledge. The mere statement by Levi in a conversation with the president of the bank when the last loan was made to him, that his stock was a security to the bank, did not amount to a pledge of such stock, as there was no delivery of the certificates. As tersely said by the court below:\n'If we assume the existence of a contract between the defendant bank and Levi (and all we know of it is the testimony of the president of the defendant as to a conversation with Levi, in which he said the bank could consider the stock in his safe as collateral for his loans), it was executory in its nature as long as the stock remained in his possession and until it was in fact pledged to the bank by a delivery. Possession is of the essence of a pledge in order to raise a privilege against third persons. Casey v. Cavaroc, \n96 U.S. 467\n, 24 L. ed. 779; Wilson v. Little, 2 N. Y. 443, 51 Am. Dec. 307.'\n\n We may, therefore, at once lay out of view the provisions of  5201, Revised Statutes, prohibiting a national bank from making any loan or discount on the security of its shares of stock, and forbidding the purchase or holding by a national bank of such shares of stock, unless necessary to prevent loss on a debt previously contracted in good faith. And putting these provisions aside, we may also pass the consideration of the decisions of this court construing the provisions in question, and holding that they may not be availed of by a debtor of the bank to defeat the enforcement of obligations by him contracted in favor of the bank. Union Nat. Bank v. Matthews, \n98 U.S. 621\n, 25 L. ed. 188; National Bank v. Whitney, \n103 U.S. 99\n, 26 L. ed. 443; Thompson v. Saint Nicholas Nat. Bank, \n146 U.S. 240\n, 36 L. ed. 956, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66. This brings us to the real question in the case, which is, the validity and effect of the provisions of the charter and by-law of the bank forbidding a transfer of stock where the stockholder was indebted to the bank, and the insertion of a condition to the same effect in the certificates of stock which were held by Levi, and which he delivered to the insurance company, as collateral, when he borrowed money from that company. If those provisions were valid it is obvious that the insurance company \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 589]\n\u00a0\n took the stock subject to the paramount right which the bank possessed. If, on the other hand, the condition in question was void because repugnant to the text of the national bank law and in conflict with the public policy which that act embodies, it is equally clear that there was no lien in favor of the bank, and the title of the insurance company, derived from its pledge and purchase, was paramount to any assumed right of the bank to refuse to transfer the stock in order to enforce a lien which, it was asserted, the bank possessed as a result of the condition in question. That the provisions referred to were void because coming within the lastmentioned category will become apparent from a brief consideration of the national bank law found in the Revised Statutes, as elucidated by its evolution from the acts of 1863 and 1864, and as expounded by the previous decisions of this court.\n National banks were first created by the act of 1863. 12 Stat. at L. 665, chap. 58. By  36 of that act it was provided:\n'That the capital stock of any association formed under this act shall be divided into shares of $100 each, and shall be assignable on the books of the association in such manner as its by-laws shall prescribe; but no shareholder in any association under this act shall have power to sell or transfer any share held in his own right so long as he shall be liable, either as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise, to the association for any debt which shall hve become due and remain unpaid, nor in any case shall such shareholder be entitled to receive any dividend, interest, or profit on such shares so long as such liabilities shall continue, but all such dividends, interests, and profits shall be retained by the association and applied to the discharge of such liabilities; and no stock shall be transferred without the consent of a majority of the directors while the holder thereof is thus indebted to the association.'\n\n Section 37 of the same act provided that--\n'No banking association shall take, as security for any loan or discount, a lien upon any part of its capital stock, . . . \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 590]\n\u00a0\n and no such banking association shall be the purchaser or holder of any portion of its capital stock or of the capital stock of any other incorporated company, unless such purchase shall be necessary to prevent loss upon a debt previously contracted in good faith on security which, at the time, was deemed adequate to insure the payment of such debt, independent of any lien upon such stock; or in case of forfeiture of stock for the nonpayment of instalments due thereon, and stock so purchased or acquired shall in no case be held by such association so purchasing for a longer period of time than six months, if the same can, within that time, be sold for what the stock cost.'\n\n The act of 1863 was expressly repealed ( 62) by the act of 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 99, chap. 106). The repealing act, however, contained the following:\n'Provided, that such repeal shall not affect any appointments made, acts done, or proceedings had, or the organization, acts, or proceedings of any association organized or in process of organization under the act aforesaid.'\n\n The act of 1864, which contained a repealing clause subject to the foregoing proviso, re-enacted in completer form the entire law as to national banks. The subjects which had been embraced by  36 of the act of 1863 were contained in  12 of the act of 1864, in part, as follows:\n'The capital stock of any association formed under this act shall be divided into shares of one hundred dollars each, and be deemed personal property, and transferable on the books of the association in such manner as may be prescribed in the by-laws or articles of association; . . .'\n\n The remaining provisions of the section related solely to the double liability of the shareholders. It hence follows that all the provisions found in  36 of the act of 1863, empowering the board of directors of a national bank to withhold a transfer in case of a debt due by a stockholder to a bank, were not only omitted from the new act, but were expressly repealed. The provision found in the 37th section of \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 591]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1863, prohibiting an association from making any loan or discount on the security of the shares of its own capital stock, was re- expressed in a substantially identical, though somewhat more amplified, form of statement in  35 of the new act. The provisions of the act of 1864, in the particulars in question, are now embodied in  5139 and 5201 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3461, 3494).\n When this history of the legislation is considered it becomes apparent that the clause inserted in the articles of association, in the by-laws and the certificates of stock of the bank here being considered, was directly repugnant to the act of 1864, and amounted simply to an attempt on the part of the bank to exercise the power which was granted under the act of 1863, but which was denied by the act of 1864. And this result was long since pointed out by the decisions of this court. In First Nat. Bank v. Lanier, 11 Wall. 369, 20 L. ed. 172, the case was this: The First National Bank of South Bend was organized under the act of 1863. A by-law of the bank provided that 'the stock of the bank should be assignable only on its books, subject to the provisions and restrictions of the act of Congress.' Culver became a stockholder in the bank, certificates having been issued to him as such, stating on their face the limitations on the power to transfer expressed in the by-law just referred to. By an agreement between Culver and the bank it was understood that his stock in the bank should secure the bank against any loss resulting from a deposit of its funds made by the bank with the house of Culver, Penn, & Co ., of New York, of which Culver was a member. When, however, this agreement was made, the certificates of stock were not delivered to the bank, but remained in the possession of Culver. After the passage of the national bank act of 1864, Culver, in violation of his agreement with the bank, sold his stock and delivered the certificates thereof, with power to transfer the same, to Lanier and Handy, who requested a transfer of the same. This the bank refused to do on the ground of Culver's agreement, and on the further ground of the provision in the by-law and certificates, which, it was \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 592]\n\u00a0\n asserted, but expressed by reference the provisions of the 36th section of the act of 1863. Two questions were necessary to be decided: a, the right of the bank resulting from the understanding with Culver; and b, its right arising from the terms of the by-law and certificate. These questions were ruled adversely to the bank. It was held that the agreement between the bank and Culver was void because it was within the prohibitions of both the 37th section of the act of 1863 and the 35th section of the act of 1864, prohibiting a national bank from loaning on the security of its own capital stock, etc. Irrespective, however, of this question, it was expressly decided that, as the act of 1864 had repealed the provision of the act of 1863, subjecting transfers of stock in national banks to debts due by the stockholder to the bank, or permitting the board of directors to provide to that effect, the result of the act of 1864 was impliedly to prohibit a bank from imposing such a condition on the transfer of stock. And the doctrine was applied to a by-law adopted prior to the passage of the act of 1864, because it was held that the continued operation of such a by-law was prevented by the act of 1864, as the right to continue it was not saved by the proviso to the repealing clause of that act. It was pointed out that the provision of the act of 1864, making the stock of national banks transferable like other personal property, was a fundamental departure from the act of 1863, and was based on a rule of public policy initiated by the act of 1864, intended to afford facilities for the transfer of stock in national banks, and thereby to encourage investment in such stock. The same subject was considered in Bullard v. National Eagle Bank, 18 Wall. 589, 21 L. ed. 923. There a by-law and form of certificate, adopted after the enactment of the statute of 1864, reserving the right to refuse to transfer stock in a national bank where the stockholder was indebted to the bank, was again determined to be ultra vires, because in conflict with the act of 1864, and such a provision was decided to be inoperative even as against the assignee in bankruptcy of the stockholder. These cases foreclose every \n\n[193 U.S. 581, 593]\n\u00a0\n question presented on this record. The cases have been frequently referred to approvingly. Earle v. Carson, \n188 U.S. 42\n, 47 L. ed. 373, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254, and authorities there cited. The contention that, although the condition in the certificate was void, nevertheless it operated as a notice to the insurance company, and thereby deprived it of its right to compel the transfer of the stock, but asserts in another form that there was power, by the insertion of such a condition in the certificate of stock, to deprive the stock of a national bank of its attribute of sale like any other personal property. The contention wholly ignores not only the text of the law, but the rule of public policy which the national bank act has been decided to embody.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHOMAS v. BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY(1904)\nNo. 43\nArgued: Decided: November 14, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., and Joseph Olds for the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University.\n Messrs. J. E. Sater and L. F. Sater for Thomas and Folsom.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is before us upon certified questions relating to the jurisdiction of the circuit court.\n The suit is in equity, and the plaintiff is a citizen of Michigan. The defendants are George Folsom, a citizen of California, and the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University.\n The object of the bill was to effect the partition of certain lands claimed by the plaintiff and the defendant Folsom as tenants in common, but held adversely by the defendant board of trustees. The plaintiff sought to have the title determined as preliminary to partition.\n The board of trustees appeared and demurred to the bill as not making a case entitling the plaintiff to any relief against it. \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n The demurrer was sustained, and the bill dismissed,-the decree reciting that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant Folsom had any title or interest in the lands described in the bill, or in the rents or profits thereof, but that the same belonged to the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University. Folsom entered his appearance in circuit court, but made no defense, nor was any decree taken by default against him.\n From that decree the plaintiff and the defendant Folsom prayed and perfected an appeal.\n It is certified that the jurisdiction of the circuit court was wholly dependent upon diversity of citizenship, and that neither defendant objected in the circuit court that the case was not of equitable cognizance, or that the court, as a Federal court, was without jurisdiction to determine it. But in the circuit court of appeals Folsom insisted, among other things, that the circuit court 'had no cognizance of the cause because the requisite diversity of citizenship does not exist, the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University not being a corporation of Ohio within the jurisdictional rule imputing to the members of that board citizenship of the state under whose law it is organized.'\n The circuit court of appeals propound the following questions:\n\n 1. \nDoes the bill sufficiently aver that the Board of Trustees of Ohio State University is a corporation of the state of Ohio, or does it aver facts which, in legal intendment, constitute said body a corporation of the state of Ohio, within the rule that a suit by or against a corporation in a court of the United States is conclusively presumed, for the purpose of litigation, to be one by or against citizens of the state creating the corporation?\n\n 2. \nIf the said board of trustees be not such a corporation as is required by the jurisdictional rule referred to, may this suit be maintained against it as 'The Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University' without bringing the persons constituting the board before the court as defendants? \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n 3. If the said board may sue or be sued in a Federal court by the name of 'The Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University,' although not constituting a corporation of the state of Ohio, within the jurisdictional rule referred to in the first question, do the facts stated on the face of the bill sufficiently show that the persons composing said board of trustees are citizens of Ohio, or should the court take notice of the law creating said board of trustees, and of other laws of Ohio defining the qualification of such trustees, and by legal intendments find that the persons constituting said board when this bill was filed were in fact citizens of Ohio, and that the requisite diversity of citizenship existed to give jurisdiction to the circuit court?\n That the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States is limited in the sense that it has no jurisdiction except that conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States; that a cause is presumed to be without its jurisdiction unless the contrary affirmatively appears; that such jurisdiction, or the facts upon which, in legal intendment, it rests, must be distinctly and positively averred in the pleadings, or should appear affirmatively and with equal distinctness in other parts of the record, it not being sufficient that jurisdiction may be inferred argumentatively; and that, for the purposes of suing and being sued in a circuit court of the United States, the members of a local 'corporation' are conclusively presumed to be citizens of the state by whose laws it was created, and in which alone the corporate body has a legal existence,-are propositions so firmly established that further discussion of them would be both useless and inappropriate.

If the record does not affirmatively show jurisdiction in the circuit court, we must, upon our own motion, so declare and make such order as will prevent that court from exercising an authority not conferred upon it by statute.'\n So that the fact stated in the certificate, that neither party in the circuit court objected to its jurisdiction, is of no consequence.\n Two other cases illustrating the above rules may be specially referred to.\n In Chapman v. Barney, \n129 \nU.S. 677, 682\n, 32 S. L. ed. 800, 801, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426, 428, which was a suit in the circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, by the United States Express Company against a citizen of Illinois, the declaration alleged that the company was organized under and by virtue of the laws of New York, and was a citizen of that state. The court said: 'On looking into the record we find no satisfactory showing as to the citizenship of the plaintiff. The allegation of the amended petition is, that the United States Express Company is a joint-stock company, organized under a law of the state of New York, and is a citizen of that state. But the express company cannot be a citizen of New York, within the meaning of the statutes regulating jurisdiction, unless it be a corporation. The allegation that the com- \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n pany was organized under the laws of New York is not an allegation that it is a corporation In fact, the allegation is, that the company is not a corporation, but a joint-stock company,-that is, a mere partnership. And, although it may be authorized by the laws of the state of New York to bring suit in the name of its president, that fact cannot give the company power, by that name, to sue in a Federal court. The company may have been organized under the laws of the state of New York, and may be doing business in that state, and yet all the members of it may not be citizens of that state. The record does not show the citizenship of Barney or of any of the members of the company.'\n In Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n177 \nU.S. 449, 456\n, 457 S., 44 L. ed. 842, 845, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690, 693, the bill alleged that the plaintiffs Jones and others were members of a limited partnership association, doing business, by their firm name, under the authority of a Pennsylvania statute, and that such association was a citizen of that state. Although the Constitution of Pennsylvania provided that the term 'corporation,' as used in a certain article of that instrument, should be construed as including all joint-stock companies or associations having any of the powers or privileges of corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships, and although the supreme court of Pennsylvania had held that it would not be improper to call a limited partnership, created under its statutes, a quasi corporation, having some of the characteristics of a corporation, this court, without considering the merits of the case, said: 'When the question relates to the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States as resting on the diverse citizenship of the parties, we must look, in the case of a suit by or against a partnership association, to the citizenship of the several persons composing such association. . . . That a limited partnership association created under the Pennsylvania statute may be described as a 'quasi corporation,' having some of the characteristics of a corporation, or as a 'new artificial person,' is not a sufficient reason for regarding it as a corporation within the jurisdictional rule \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 213]\n\u00a0\n heretofore adverted to. That rule must not be extended. We are unwilling to extend it so as to embrace partnership associations. . . . We therefore adjudge that, as the bill does not make a case arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it was necessary to set out the citizenship of the individual members of the partnership association of Jones & Laughlins, Limited, which brought this suit.' The judgment was reversed upon the ground that the jurisdiction of the circuit court did not affirmatively appear from the record. Upon the return of the cause to the court of original jurisdiction the bill was amended, and it was alleged that each member of the partnership was a citizen of Pennsylvania. The case was then heard upon its merits and was again brought here and determined. Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n193 U.S. 532\n, 48 L. ed. 778, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576.\n In the light of these decisions we come to the question whether the jurisdiction of the circuit court affirmatively appears in this case. If it does not, it must be held that that court had no authority to take cognizance of it.\n The bill alleges that the defendant the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University 'was created by, and exists under and by virtue of, a law duly passed and enacted by the legislature of said state of Ohio, on March 22d, 1870, and now known and designated as  4105-9 and following, of the Revised Statutes of said state of Ohio, and the subsequent acts amendatory of and supplementary thereto;' that said board, 'under and by virtue of the aforesaid laws and enactments, and at all times since its creation and establishment, is fully authorized and empowered to sue and be sued, to contract and be contracted with, to make and use a common seal, and to alter the same at its pleasure, and to adopt by-laws, rules, and regulations for the government of said college, and to have the general supervision of all lands, buildings, and other property belonging to said college, and of receiving by gift, devise, or bequest, moneys, lands, and other properties for its benefit and for the benefit of those under its charge, subject, \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 214]\n\u00a0\n however, to the provisions, exceptions, and restrictions contained in section twenty and five thousand nine hundred and fifteen of the Revised Statutes of the state of Ohio;' and is 'a citizen of and domiciled in the state of Ohio.' 67 Ohio Laws, 20; 75 Ohio Laws, 126; Ohio Rev. Stat.  4105 et seq.\n Do those averments, taken in connection with the statutes of Ohio relating to the defendant board,-of the provisions of which statutes judicial notice may be taken (Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 29 S. L. ed. 535, 537, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242),-sufficiently show that the circuit court was entitled to take cognizance of this case?\n If the defendant board had been specifically averred to be, and was in fact, a corporation created by and existing under the laws of Ohio, then, within the meaning of the adjudged cases, the controversy would have been one between citizens of different states, and consequently within the jurisdiction of the circuit court; for, in that case, the legal presumption would be that the trustees were citizens of the state by which the corporation was brought into existence, and no averment or evidence to the contrary would be admissible for the purpose of withdrawing the suit from the jurisdiction of the circuit court. Ohio & M. R. Co. v. Wheeler, 1 Black, 286, 296, 17 L. ed. 130. Here the averment is only that the defendant board of trustees is a citizen of and domiciled in Ohio; not that the trustees themselves are citizens of that state. That averment alone is not sufficient. In Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 405, 15 L. ed. 451, 452, which was a suit brought in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Indiana, the declaration alleged that the plaintiffs were citizens of Ohio, and that the defendant, the Lafayette Insurance Company, was a citizen of Indiana. This court, speaking by Justice Curtis, said: 'This averment is not sufficient to show jurisdiction. It does not appear from it that the Lafayette Insurance Company is a corporation, or, if it be such, by the law of what state it was created. The averment that the company is a citizen of the state of Indiana can have no sensible meaning attached to it. This court does not hold that either a voluntary association of \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 215]\n\u00a0\n persons, or an association into a body politic, created by law, is a citizen of a state within the meaning of the Constitution.' It is vital that the corporate character of the collective body should be averred or shown.\n The fundamental inquiry, therefore, is whether the defendant board of trustees is a 'corporation' within the jurisdictional rule that admits of a corporation being regarded, for purposes of suing and being sued in the courts of the United States, as a citizen of the state under and by the laws of which it was created. The pleadings, we have seen, do not in terms aver the board to be a corporation; only that it is a citizen of and domiciled in Ohio, and to have been created as a collective body by the laws of that state, with power to sue and be sued by the name of the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University. Those laws must therefore be examined in order to ascertain whether, for purposes of suit in the circuit court of the United States, the board may be deemed a corporation of Ohio within the meaning of the above cases.\n In determining this question we are confronted with the fact that the statute creating the defendant board was clearly a special, as distinguished from a general, act, and that the Constitution of Ohio forbade the passage of any special act conferring corporate powers. Ohio Const. art. 13,  1. So that the board of trustees cannot be held to have been made a corporation or endowed with corporate powers without holding that the act by which it was created was invalid under the Constitution of Ohio; whereas, the supreme court of Ohio have adjudicated that the act was valid, as not conferring, and as not intended to confer, corporate powers on the board.\n This question was presented in Neil v. Ohio Agricultural & Mechanical College (1876) 31 Ohio St. 15, 21, which was the original name of the Ohio State University. The validity of the act creating the board was there brought in question as having, to all intents and purposes, created a corporation, and clothed it with corporate powers and privileges. But the supreme court of Ohio said: \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 216]\n\u00a0\n 'We are not able to yield our assent to this construction of the statute. The act is entitled 'An Act to Establish and Maintain an Agricultural and Mechanical College in Ohio.' It creates a board of trustees, to be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate; and commits to such board the government, control, and general management of the affairs of the institution; and while the statute authorizes the board to make contracts for the benefit of the college, and to maintain actions, if necessary, to enforce them, and to exercise other powers similar to those conferred on bodies corporate, it does not assume to, nor does it in fact, create or constitute such board of trustees a corporation; and hence does not clothe it with corporate functions or powers. State ex rel. Atty, Gen. v. Davis, 23 Ohio St. 434. The college is a state institution, designed and well calculated to promote public educational interests, established for the people of the whole state, to be managed and controlled by such agencies as the legislature, in its wisdom, may provide. Similar powers, but perhaps less extensive, because less required, are conferred on the trustees of the various hospitals for the insane (73 Ohio Laws, 80), and on the board of managers of the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Homes (67 Ohio Laws, 53), and other institutions of the state. The powers thus conferred are essentially necessary to accomplish the objects for which these institutions were established. The power to establish them is found clearly granted in the 7th article of the Constitution.' The article here referred to gave the legislature power to establish benevolent and other state institutions.\n Thus, upon an issue distinctly made, the supreme court of Ohio has adjudged that the defendant board is not, and was not intended to be made, a corporation of the state, but only an agency to manage and control a state institution as the state may direct or provide. And the interpretation of the state Constitution upon which that judgment rests has never been modified by that court.\n While the state court may not conclusively determine for \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 217]\n\u00a0\n this court what is and what is not a corporation within the meaning of the jurisdictional rule that a corporation, for purposes of suing and being sued in the courts of the United States, is, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, to be deemed a citizen of the state by whose laws it is created, nevertheless, this court should accept the judgment of the highest court of a state upon the question whether a particular body created by its laws is or is not a corporation, by virtue of those laws, unless a contrary view is demanded by most cogent reasons involving or affecting the constitutional and statutory jurisdiction of the Federal courts. No such reasons exist in this case; and, accepting the above decision of the supreme court of Ohio as correctly interpreting the Constitution and laws of that state, we hold that while the defendant board is clothed with some, it is not clothed with all, of the functions belonging to technical corporations, and is not such a corporation as may sue and be sued in a circuit court of the United States as a citizen of Ohio. A contrary ruling would, we apprehend, produce confusion and embarrassment in litigation relating to those public state institutions or agencies in Ohio which, according to the decision of its highest court, were not endowed, nor intended to be endowed, with corporate powers.\n It is contended, however, that the bill sufficiently shows that the persons constituting the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University were in fact citizens of Ohio, and therefore, as the board had power to sue and be sued, and to contract and be contracted with, in its collective name, the requisite diversity of citizenship sufficiently appeared from the pleadings. This contention is not warranted by any distinct averments in the bill. The bill contains no such averment. As already stated, it alleges that the board is a citizen of Ohio; not that the trustees are citizens of the state. As already stated, the bill does not, in terms, even allege that the board is a corporation, although it shows that it possesses some of the characteristics of corporations. The Constitution of Ohio pro- \n\n[195 U.S. 207, 218]\n\u00a0\n vides that no person shall be elected or appointed to any office in the state unless he possesses the qualifications of an elector; and an elector must be a citizen of the state (Const. art. 15,  4, art. 5,  1); therefore it must be taken, not only that each trustee of the Ohio State University holds an office within the meaning of the state Constitution, but is in fact a citizen of that state; and the allegation that the board was created by, and existed as, an organized body under the laws of Ohio, was equivalent to an allegation that the trustees are each and all citizens of Ohio. Such is the process of reasoning by which it is attempted to support the jurisdiction of the circuit court in the present case. But it is settled that the jurisdiction of a court of the United States must appear from distinct allegations, or from facts clearly proven, and is not to be established argumentatively or by mere inference. The presumption is that a cause is without the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States unless the contrary affirmatively and distinctly appears. Brown v. Keene, 8 Pet. 115, 8 L. ed. 886, and other cases above cited.\n For the reasons stated the first question must be answered in the negative. To the second question our answer is that as the board was entitled to sue and be sued by their collective name, and would be bound by any judgment rendered against it in that name, the jurisdiction of the circuit court would have sufficiently appeared, so far as the pleadings were concerned, without bringing the several persons constituting the board before the court as defendants, provided the bill had contained the additional allegation that each individual trustee was a citizen of Ohio. Each branch of the third question must be answered in the negative. These answers will be certified to the circuit court of appeals, with liberty to that court to authorize such amendment of the bill in the circuit court as will show jurisdiction.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHOMAS v. U S(1904)\nNo. 43\nArgued: December 4, 1903Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank D. Pavey, Walter J. Moore, and Charles C. Pavey, for plaintiff in error.\n George C. Thomas was indicted for violation of the internal revenue laws of the United States in that, being a broker in the city of New York, he sold certain shares of Atchison preferred stock and omitted the required revenue stamps from the memorandum of sale. He demurred to the indictment on the ground that the act of June 13, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 448, chap. 448),1 which required the stamps to be affixed, was unconstitutional. The demurrer was overruled, the court, Thomas, J., delivering an opinion. 115 Fed. 207.\n Trial was had, defendant found guilty, and judgment rendered, sentencing him to pay a fine of $500.\n The case was then brought here on writ of error. \n\n[192 U.S. 363, 364]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the first clause of  8 of article I. of the Constitution, Congress is empowered 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.' 'but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.'\n This division of taxation into two classes is recognized throughout the Constitution.\n By clause 3 of  2, representatives and direct taxes are required to be apportioned according to the enumeration prescribed, and by clause 4 of  9, no capitation or other direct tax can be laid except according to that enumeration.\n By clause 1 of  9, the migration or importation of persons by the states was not to be prohibited prior to 1808, but a tax or duty could be imposed on such importation, not exceeding $10 for each person.\n By clause 5 it is provided: 'No tax or duty shall be laid on any articles exported from any state.'\n By clause 2 of  10, no state can, 'without the \n\n[192 U.S. 363, 370]\n\u00a0\n consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.' By clause 3 the states are forbidden, without the consent of Congress, to 'lay any duty of tonnage.'\n And these two classes, taxes so called, and 'duties, imposts, and excises,' apparently embrace all forms of taxation contemplated by the Constitution. As was observed in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 \nU.S. 429, 557\n, 39 S. L. ed. 759, 810, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, 680: 'Although there have been from time to time intimations that there might be some tax which was not a direct tax nor included under the words 'duties, imposts, and excises,' such a tax for more than one hundred years of national existence has as yet remained undiscovered, notwithstanding the stress of particular circumstances has invited thorough investigation into sources of revenue.'\n The present case involves a stamp tax on a memorandum or contract of sale of a certificate of stock, which plaintiff in error claims was unlawfully exacted because not falling within the class of duties, imposts, and excises, and being, on the contrary, a direct tax on property.\n There is no occasion to attempt to confine the words duties, imposts, and excises to the limits of precise definition. We think that they were used comprehensively to cover customs and excise duties imposed on importation, consumption, manufacture, and sale of certain commodities, privileges, particular business transactions, vocations, occupations, and the like.\n Taxes of this sort have been repeatedly sustained by this court, and distinguished from direct taxes under the Constitution. As in Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 1 L. ed. 556, on the use of carriages; in Nicol v. Ames, \n173 U.S. 509\n, 43 L. ed. 786, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522, on sales at exchanges or boards of trade; in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. 747, on the transmission of property from the dead to the living; in Treat v. White, \n181 U.S. 264\n, 45 L. ed. 853, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611, on agreements to sell shares of stock denominated 'calls' by New York stockbrokers; in \n\n[192 U.S. 363, 371]\n\u00a0\n Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n,46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, on tobacco manufactured for consumption.\n Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 6 L. ed. 678, and Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 45 L. ed. 862, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, are not in point. In the one the clause of the Constitution was considered which forbids any state, without the consent of Congress, to 'lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports,' and in the other, that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' The distinction between direct and indirect taxes was not involved in either case.\n The sale of stocks is a particular business transaction in the exercise of the privilege afforded by the laws in respect to corporations of disposing of property in the form of certificates. The stamp duty is contingent on the happening of the event of sale, and the element of absolute and unavoidable demand is lacking. As such it falls, as stamp taxes ordinarily do, within the second class of the forms of taxation.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp.

COLWELL(1904)\nNo. 160\nArgued: February 26, 1904Decided: March 21, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The plaintiff in error applied to the supreme court of the state of New York for an order discharging of record a certain judgment of that court obtained against him by the defendant in error. The application was denied (35 Misc. 330, 6 Am. Bankr. Rep. 434, 71 N. Y. Supp. 952), and the order denying it was affirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court (65 App. Div. 20, 72 N. Y. Supp. 505), and subsequently by the court of appeals (169 N. Y. 531, 58 L. R. A. 765, 62 N. E. 668), and the latter court thereupon remitted the record to the supreme court, where it remained at the time plaintiff in error sued out this writ to review the order of the court of appeals.\n The application was made under  1268 of the New York Code, which provides that any time after one year has \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n elapsed since a bankrupt was discharged from his debts, pursuant to the act of Congress relating to bankruptcy, he may apply, after notice to the plaintiff in the judgment, and upon proof of his discharge, to the court in which the judgment was rendered against him for an order directing the judgment to be canceled and discharged of record. The section further provides that if it appear on hearing that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment or the debt upon which such judgment was recovered, an order must be made directing the judgment to be canceled and discharged of record.\n The application in this proceeding was made upon a petition by plaintiff in error, which showed that Frederick L. Colwell, the plaintiff in the action, had, on February 9, 1897, recovered a judgment for $50,000 and costs against the petitioner for damages for his criminal conversation with the plaintiff's wife; that the judgment was duly docketed in the county of New York on that day; that on September 13, 1899, petitioner filed his petition in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, praying that he might be adjudged a bankrupt, and on that day he was adjudged a bankrupt by the district court, pursuant to the act of Congress relating to bankruptcy; on February 2, 1900, the petitioner was discharged by the district court of the United States from all debts and claims which were made provable by the act of Congress against his estate, and which existed on September 13, 1899; that the judgment above mentioned was not recovered against him for a wilful and malicious injury to the person or property of the plaintiff, within the meaning of the act of Congress, and that, by virtue of the discharge in bankruptcy, the petitioner had been duly released from that judgment.\n In granting the discharge under the bankrupt act (which was opposed by the plaintiff in the judgment), the district judge refused to pass upon the question whether the judgment was thereby released, although it appears that he thought it was. 99 Fed. 79. \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nelson Smith for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas McAdam and George Newell Hamlin for defendant in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The question herein arising is whether the judgment obtained against the defendant, petitioner, for damages arising from the criminal conversation of the defendant with the plaintiff's wife, is released by the defendant's discharge in bankruptcy, or whether it is excepted from such release by reason of subdivision 2,  17, of the bankruptcy act of July 1, 1898, which provides that 'a discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another; . . .' [30 Stat. at L. 550, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3428].\n The averment in the petition, that the judgment was not recovered for a wilful and malicious injury to the person or \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 481]\n\u00a0\n property of the plaintiff in the action, is a mere conclusion of law, and not an averment of fact.\n If the judgment in question in this proceeding be one which was recovered in an action for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another, it was not released by the bankrupt's discharge; otherwise it was.\n We are of opinion that it was not released. We think the authorities show the husband had certain personal and exclusive rights with regard to the person of his wife which are interfered with and invaded by criminal conversation with her; that such an act on the part of another man constitutes an assault even when, as is almost universally the case as proved, the wife in fact consents to the act; because the wife is in law incapable of giving any consent to affect the husband's rights as against the wrongdoer, and that an assault of this nature may properly be described as an injury to the personal rights and property of the husband, which is both malicious and wilful. A judgment upon such a cause of action is not released by the defendant's discharge in bankruptcy.\n The assault vi et armis is a fiction of the law, assumed at first, in early times, to give jurisdiction of the cause of action as a trespass, to the courts, which then proceeded to permit the recovery of damages by the husband for his wounded feelings and honor, the defilement of the marriage bed, and for the doubt thrown upon the legitimacy of children.\n Subsequently the action of trespass on the case was sustained for the consequent damage, and either form of action was thereafter held proper.\n Blackstone, in referring to the rights of the husband, says (3 Bl. Com. edited by Wendell, page 139):\n'Injuries that may be offered to a person, considered as a husband, are principally three: abduction, or taking away a man's wife; adultery, or criminal conversation with her; and beating or otherwise abusing her . . . . 2. Adultery, or criminal conversation with a man's wife, though it is, as a public crime, left by our laws to the coercion of the spiritual \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 482]\n\u00a0\n courts; yet, considered as a civil injury (and surely there can be no greater), the law gives a satisfaction to the husband for it by action of trespass vi et armis against the adulterer, wherein the damages recovered are usually very large and exemplary.'\n\n Speaking of injuries to what he terms the relative rights of persons, Chitty says that for actions of that nature (criminal conversation being among them) the usual, and, perhaps, the more correct, practice, is to declare in trespass vi et armis and contra pacem. 1 Chitty, Pl. [2 vol. ed .] 150, and note h.\n In Macfadzen v. Olivant, 6 East, 387, it was held that the proper action was trespass vi et armis, for that the defendant with force and arms assaulted and seduced the plaintiff's wife, whereby he lost and was deprived of her comfort, society, and fellowship, against the peace and to his damage. Lord Ellenborough, C. J., among other things, said:\n'Then the question is, whether this can be an action on the case or an action of trespass and assault. And it is said that the latter description only applies to personal assaults on the body of the plaintiff who sues; but nothing of that sort is said in the statute. No doubt that an action of trespass and assault may be maintained by a master for the battery of his servant per quod servitium amisit; and so by a husband for a trespass and assault of this kind upon his wife per quod consortium amisit.'\n\n In Rigaut v. Gallisard, 7 Mod. 78, Lord Holt, C. J., said that if adultery be committed with another man's wife, without any force, but by her own consent, the husband may have assault and battery, and lay it vi et armis, and that the proper action for the husband in such case was a special action, quia,-the defendant his wife rapuit, and not to lay it per quod consortium amisit.\n In Haney v. Townsend, 1 M'Cord L. 206, decided in 1821, it was held that case as well as trespass vi et armis is a proper action for criminal conversation, the court holding that no doubt trespass was a proper form of action for the injury done by seducing a wife, but that case was also a proper action. \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 483]\n\u00a0\n In Bedan v. Turney, 99 Cal. 649, 34 Pac. 442, decided in 1893, it was held that the criminal intercourse of the wife with another man was an invasion of the husband's rights, and it was immaterial whether this invasion was accomplished by force or by the consent of the wife; that the right belonged to the husband, and it was no defense to his action for redress that its violation was by the consent or even by the procurement of the wife, for she was not competent to give such consent; that it was not necessary that the husband should show that it was by force or against her will. The original form of the action was trespass vi et armis, even though the act was with the consent of the wife, for the reason, as was said by Holt, C. J., in Rigaut v. Gallisard, 7 Mod. 78, 'that the law will not allow her a consent in such case to the prejudice of her husband.'\n In M'Clure v. Miller, 11 N. C. (4 Hawks) 133, note, page 140, trespass was held to be the proper form of action in such a case, and that a single act of adultery, though never manifested in its consequences, is an invasion of the husband's rights, and the law redresses it. It is also said that the husband has, so to speak, a property in the body and a right to the personal enjoyment of his wife. For the invasion of this right the law permits him to sue as husband.\n For the purpose of maintaining the action, it is regarded as an actual trespass upon the marital rights of the husband, although the consequent injury is really to the husband on account of the corruption of the body and mind of the wife, and it is in this view (that it is a trespass upon the rights of the husband) that it is held that the consent of the wife makes no difference; that she is incapable of giving a consent to an injury to the husband. 7 Mod. 78.\n In Wales v. Miner, 89 Ind. 118, decided in 1883, it was held that in an action of crim. con. the wife was incapable of consenting to her own seduction so as to bar her husband's right of action.\n In Bigaouette v. Paulet, 134 Mass. 123, 45 Am. Rep. 307, it was held the action could be maintained whether the conversation was \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 484]\n\u00a0\n with or without the consent of the wife, and although the act caused no actual loss of the services of the wife to the husband.\n Many of the cases hold that the essential injury to the husband consists in the defilement of the marriage bed, in the invasion of his exclusive right to marital intercourse with his wife and to beget his own children. This is a right of the highest kind, upon the thorough maintenance of which the whole social order rests, and in order to the maintenance of the action it may properly be described as a property right.\n In Delamater v. Russell, 4 How. Pr. 234, it was held that the act complained of (criminal conversation) was an injury to the person of the plaintiff; that it was an invasion of his personal rights, and although the action was brought for depriving the plaintiff of the comfort, society, fellowship, aid, and assistance of the wife, yet it was an action brought for an injury to, and an invasion of, the plaintiff's personal rights.\n The plaintiff in error refers to the case of Cregin v. Brooklyn Crosstown R. Co. 75 N. Y. 192, 31 Am. Rep. 459, same case upon second appeal, 83 N. Y. 595, 38 Am. Rep. 474, for the purpose of showing that the right to the society of the wife is not property, and therefore cannot be regarded as within the words of the bankruptcy act. The case does not decide that the right to the wife's society and comfort is not a property right on the part of the husband. It was a case brought by the husband against the railroad company for injuries negligently inflicted on the person of his wife by the company, and after the action was brought the husband died, and an application was made to revive the action in the name of the administrator of the husband. The court held that the action survived under the provisions of the state statute. 2 Rev. Stat. 447,  1. The case then went to trial and the judge submitted to the jury the question of damages arising for the loss of the services of the wife and of her society, and it was held to be error by the court of appeals, because, while the right to the services of the wife was property, the right to her society, etc., was not property within the meaning of the statute providing for the \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 485]\n\u00a0\n survival of the cause of action, for the reason that the statute only provided for the survival of those rights the loss of which diminished the estate of the deceased; that the loss of the services of the wife did diminish the estate of the deceased, but that the loss to the husband of the wife's society and aid, etc., did not diminish his estate, and therefore the right of action consequent thereon did not survive the deceased. The question in the case at bar neither arose nor was referred to in the opinions delivered in that case.\n We think it is made clear by these references to a few of the many cases on this subject that the cause of action by the husband is based upon the idea that the act of the defendant is a violation of the marital rights of the husband in the person of his wife, to the exclusion of all others, and so the act of the defendant is an injury to the person and also to the property rights of the husband.\n We think such an act is also a wilful and malicious injury to the person or property of the husband, within the meaning of the exception in the statute.\n There may be cases where the act has been performed without any particular malice towards the husband, but we are of opinion that, within the meaning of the exception, it is not necessary that there should be this particular, and, so to speak, personal malevolence toward the husband, but that the act itself necessarily implies that degree of malice which is sufficient to bring the case within the exception stated in the statute. The act is wilful, of course, in the sense that it is intentional and voluntary, and we think that it is also malicious within the meaning of the statute.\n In order to come within that meaning as a judgment for a wilful and malicious injury to person or property, it is not necessary that the cause of action be based upon special malice, so that without it the action could not be maintained.\n In Bromage v. Prosser, 4 Barn. & C. 247, which was an action of slander, Mr. Justice Bayley, among other things, said:\n'Malice, in common acceptation, means ill will against a \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 486]\n\u00a0\n person; but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse. If I give a perfect stranger a blow likely to produce death, I do it of malice, because I do it intentionally and without just cause or excuse. If I maim cattle, without knowing whose they are, if I poison a fishery, without knowing the owner, I do it of malice, because it is a wrongful act, and done intentionally. If I am arraigned of felony, and wilfully stand mute, I am said to do it of malice, because it is intentional and without just cause or excuse. If I traduce a man, whether I know him or not and whether I intend to do him an injury or not, I apprehend the law considers it as done of malice, because it is wrongful and intentional. It equally works an injury, whether I meant to produce an injury or not. . . .'\n\n We cite the case as good definition of the legal meaning of the word malice. The law will, as we think, imply that degree of malice in an act of the nature under consideration, which is sufficient to bring it within the exception mentioned.\n In Re Freche (U. S. district court, district of New Jersey, 1901) 109 Fed. 620, it was held that a judgment for the father in an action to recover damages for the seduction of his daughter was for a wilful and malicious injury to the person and property of another, within the meaning of  17 of the bankrupt act, and was not released by a discharge in bankruptcy. Kirkpatrick, District Judge, in the course of his opinion, said:\n'From the nature of the case, the act of the defendant Freche which caused the injury was wilful, because it was voluntary. That act was unlawful, wrongful, and tortious, and, being wilfully done, it was, in law, malicious. It was malicious because the injurious consequences which followed the wrongful act were those which might naturally be expected to result from it, and which the defendant Freche must be presumed to have had in mind when he committed the offense. 'Malice,' in law, simply means a depraved inclination on the part of a person to disregard the rights of others, which intent is mani- \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 487]\n\u00a0\n fested by his injurious acts. While it may be true that in his unlawful act Freche was not actuated by hatred or revenge or passion towards the plaintiff, nevertheless, if he acted wantonly against what any man of reasonable intelligence must have known to be contrary to his duty, and purposely prejudicial and injurious to another, the law will imply malice.'\n\n In Leicester v. Hoadley, supreme court of Kansas, 1903, 66 Kan. 172, 71 Pac. 318, it was held that a judgment obtained by a wife against another woman for damages sustained by the wife by reason of the alienation of the affections of her husband is not released by the discharge of the judgment debtor under proceedings in bankruptcy, where such alienation has been accomplished by schemes and devices of the judgment debtor, and resulted in the loss of support and impairment of health to the wife.\n It was further held that injuries so inflicted are wilful and malicious, and are to the person and property of another, within the meaning of  17 of the United States bankrupt law.\n In United States v. Reed, 86 Fed. 308, it was held that malice consisted in the wilful doing of an act which the person doing it knows is liable to injure another, regardless of the consequences; and a malignant spirit or a specific intention to hurt a particular person is not an essential element. Upon that principle, we think a wilful disregard of what one knows to be his duty, an act which is against good morals, and wrongful in and of itself, and which necessarily causes injury and is done intentionally, may be said to be done wilfully and maliciously, so as to come within the exception.\n It is urged that the malice referred to in the exception is malice towards the individual personally, such as is meant, for instance, in a statute for maliciously injuring or destroying property, or for malicious mischief, where mere intentional injury without special malice towards the individual has been held by some courts not to be sufficient. Com. v. Williams, 110 Mass. 401. \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 488]\n\u00a0\n We are not inclined to place such a narrow construction upon the language of the exception. We do not think the language used was intended to limit the exception in any such way. It was an honest debtor, and not a malicious wrongdoer, that was to be discharged.\n Howland v. Carson, 28 Ohio St. 628, is cited by plaintiff in error. The question arose under the old bankruptcy act, which provided (U. S. Rev. Stat. 5117) that no debt created by fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in a fiduciary character, should be discharged by proceedings in bankruptcy, etc. It was held in the case cited that a judgment for the seduction of his daughter in favor of the father, where the seduction was not induced or accomplished under a promise of marriage fraudulently made for the purpose, was not a debt created by fraud, within the meaning of the bankruptcy act. We do not perceive the least similarity in the case to the one now before the court, nor could we say that such a debt was one created by fraud.\n It is also argued that, as the fraud referred to in the exception is not one which the law implies, but is a particular fraud involving moral turpitude or intentional wrongdoing, so the malice referred to is not a malice implied in law, but a positive and special malice upon which the cause of action is founded, and without proof of which the action could not be maintained. It is true that the fraud mentioned in the bankruptcy statute of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176] has been held to be a fraud involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, and did not extend to a mere fraud implied by law. Hennequin v. Clews, \n111 \nU.S. 676, 681\n, 28 S. L. ed. 565, 567, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Forsyth v. Vehmeyer, \n177 U.S. 177\n, 44 L. ed. 723, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 623. The reason given was that the word was used in the statute in association with a debt created by embezzlement, and such association was held to require the conclusion that the fraud referred to meant positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, and not a fraud which the law might imply and which might exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality. \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 489]\n\u00a0\n Assuming that the same holding would be made in regard to the fraud mentioned in the present act, it is clear that the cases are unlike. The implied fraud which the court in the above-cited cases released was of such a nature that it did not impute either bad faith or immorality to the debtor, while in a judgment founded upon a cause of action such as the one before us, the malice which is implied is of that very kind which does involve moral turpitude. This case is not, therefore, controlled in principle by the above-cited cases.\n People ex rel. Livergood v. Greer, 43 Ill. 213, is also cited. The court there did hold that, under the Illinois insolvent law, an insolvent debtor was discharged from a judgment obtained by the father for the seduction of his daughter. The law discharging the debt extended by its terms to all tort feasors except where malice was the gist of the action, and the court said malice was not the gist of the action in question. The case is not opposed to the views we have already expressed.\n It is not necessary in the construction we give to the language of the exception in the statute to hold that every wilful act which is wrong implies malice. One who negligently drives through a crowded thoroughfare and negligently runs over an individual would not, as we suppose, be within the exception. True, he drives negligently, and that is a wrongful act, but he does not intentionally drive over the individual. If he intentionally did drive over him, it would certainly be malicious. It might be conceded that the language of the exception could be so construed as to make the exception refer only to those injuries to person or property which were accompanied by particular malice, or, in other words, a malevolent purpose towards the injured person, and where the action could only be maintained upon proof of the existence of such malice. But we do not think the fair meaning of the statute would thereby be carried out. The judgment here mentioned comes, as we think, within the language of the statute, reasonably construed. The injury for which it was recovered is one of the \n\n[193 U.S. 473, 490]\n\u00a0\n grossest which can be inflicted upon the husband, and the person who perpetrates it knows it is an offense of the most aggravated character; that it is a wrong for which no adequate compensation can be made, and hence personal and particular malice towards the husband as an individual need not be shown, for the law implies that there must be malice in the very act itself, and we think Congress did not intend to permit such an injury to be released by a discharge in bankruptcy.\n An action to redress a wrong of this character should not be taken out of the exception on any narrow and technical construction of the language of such exception.\n For the reasons stated, we think the order of the Court of Appeals of New York must be affirmed.\n Mr, Justice Brown, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Holmes dissent. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOM HONG v. U S(1904)\nNo. 310\nArgued: January 12, 1904Decided: March 21, 1904\n\n\n\n\n These cases were considered together and are appeals from an order entered in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of New York, affirming an order \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n made by a United States commissioner, directing the deportation of the appellants from the United States to China upon the ground that they were found within this country without certificates of registration, as required by the act of May 5, 1892 [27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1319], as amended November 3, 1893. 28 Stat. at L. 7, chap. 14, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1322\n\n\n The complaint charges that the appellants, being Chinese laborers, not entitled to remain in this country without certificates of registration, did wilfully and knowingly fail to obtain the certificates required by law, and, having unlawfully come within the United States, were found without certificates of registration within the jurisdiction thereof, in the eastern district of the state of New York.\n Testimony was heard in the cases, and at the conclusion of the hearings the commissioner made an order finding each of the appellants a Chinese laborer, without a certificate of registration as required by law, and not a merchant doing business within the meaning of the act of 1892, as amended 1893, and not lawfully entitled to remain in this country.\n In each of the cases the commissioner, in addition to the judgment just recited, filed a finding, which was made part of the record by order of the district court, as follows:\n In the Matter of Lee Kit, Tom Hong, and Tom Dock.\n Before B. L. Benedict, U. S. commissioner.\n In these three cases it is urged, on one side, that the decision of the circuit court of appeals of this circuit, in the case of United States v. Pin Kwan, requires the commissioner to decide that these three Chinese persons were not merchants within the meaning of the statute in 1894, and that, being now laborers without certificate of residence, they must be deported. On the other side it is urged that the decision of the court in that case was only that the merchant's certificate that Pin Kwan had was not the certificate required by law, and could not be effective to allow his remaining here, and that the discussion of the effect and weight of evidence which the court itself had said it was error to admit (a certificate being the sole proof \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n admissible) goes merely to show what the court thought of the evidence in that case, which differed from the present one. Admitting the distinction, I do not think the United States commissioner is at liberty to disregard carefully expressed language of the circuit court of appeals for the circuit, even though a dictum of the court as to the precise question before it. The proofs furnished in this case are sufficient to show that these three persons were engaged in business rather than in manual labor in 1894, but not to show a real interest of each in the business as partners; they do not, to my mind, clearly establish facts which would bring these persons within the statute as merchants. It follows that an order for deportation for each one must be made.\n I certify the foregoing to be a true copy of an original decision made by me in the cases of United States v. Lee Kit, United States v. Tom Hong, and United States v. Tom Dock, upon application for orders of deportation of the said Lee Kit, Tom Hong, and Tom Dock, made on the 18th day of December, 1902, and remaining on file in my office.\n B.

Landale for appellants.\n Solicitor General Hoyt for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention of the appellants that their right to remain in the United States is enlarged by the treaty with China of \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n December, 1894, considered with  1 of the act of April 29, 1902, chap. 641, 32 Stat. at L. 176,1 continuing all laws then in force so far as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations, in its effect upon the acts of 1892, as amended in 1893, is disposed of by the case of Ah How v. United States (decided at this term), \n193 U.S. 65\n, ante, 357, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357.\n For the first time in the history of legislation having for its purpose the exclusion of certain Chinese from the country, or their deportation when here in violation of the statutes of the United States, and the admission of certain others to the country, or giving the right to remain, Congress, by the act of May, 1892, as amended November 3, 1893, defined those theretofore designated generally as merchants or laborers:\n'Sec. 2. The words 'laborer' or 'laborers,' wherever used in this act, or in the act to which this is an amendment, shall be construed to mean both skilled and unskilled manual laborers, including Chinese employed in mining, fishing, huckstering, peddling, laundrymen, or those engaged in taking, drying, or otherwise preserving shell or other fish for home consumption or exportation.\n\n'The term 'merchant,' as employed herein and in the acts of which this is amendatory, shall have the following meaning, and none other: A merchant is a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise, at a fixed place of business, which business is conducted in his name, and who, during the time he claims to be engaged as a merchant, does not engage in the performance of any manual labor except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant.'\n\n It is contended by the appellants that as by  6 of the act as amended November 3, 1893, it is made the duty of certain Chinese laborers within the limits of the United States to apply to the collector of their respective districts within six months after the passage of the act for a certificate of registration, and, in default of compliance with the terms of the act, to be subject to arrest and deportation, unless, for certain reasons given in the statute excusing them, they have been \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n unable to procure the certificate required by law; and as  2 of the same act specifically defines what is meant by a 'laborer,' that only such as come within the statutory provision as 'laborers' are liable to deportation upon an affirmative finding of this fact as to the person apprehended.\n On the part of the government, it is contended that when a Chinese laborer is apprehended under this act and found without a certificate, and claiming to have been a merchant during the period of registration, he is subject to deportation unless it is affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of the commissioner or court, that he was a merchant, as defined by the statute, during such period of registration.\n We do not find it necessary to determine this question in the cases now before us, for, in the opinion of the court, the testimony shows that the appellants were 'merchants' within the definition laid down by the law. The testimony shows, without contradiction, and by disinterested witnesses other than Chinese, that the appellants had been in this country for periods varying from ten to thirty years. That in the years from 1891 to 1895 they were carrying on a Chinese grocery in New York, known as the Kwong Yen Ti Company. In that period they bought and sold groceries, kept books of account, and had articles of partnership. It is a fact that the testimony does not disclose, as to any of them, that the business was conducted in his name, as the literal interpretation of the law would seem to require, but it was carried on in a company name, which did not include that of any of the partners. The fact of buying and selling at a fixed place of business in a real partnership was established without contradiction.\n It is true that after the lapse of so many years the appellants, when taken before the commissioner, were unable to produce the books or articles of copartnership of the firm. But some allowance must be made for the long delay in their prosecution by the government, and the natural loss of such testimony years after the firm's transactions were closed. \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n The commissioner was doubtless influenced by the intimation in the Pin Kwan Case, 40 C. C. A. 618, 100 Fed. 609, to the effect that the statutory requirements as to the conduct of the business in the name of the parties necessitated the appearance of the name in the style in which the business was conducted. But this would be too narrow a construction of the statute. The purpose of the law is to prevent those who have no real interest in the business from making fraudulent claims to the benefits of the act as merchants. The interest in the business must be substantial and real and in the name of the person claiming to own it, but the partner's name need not necessarily appear in the firm style when carried on, as is usual among the Chinese, under a company name which does not include individual names. The main purpose is to require the person to be a bona fide merchant, having, in his own name and right, an interest in a real mercantile business, in which he does only the manual labor necessary to the conduct thereof. This conclusion has been reached in a number of Federal cases, in which the matter has been given careful consideration. Perhaps the leading one was decided by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit (Lee Kan v. United States, 10 C. C. A. 669, 15 U. S. App. 516, 62 Fed. 914), the opinion being delivered by Mr. Justice McKenna, then circuit judge, in which the subject was so fully considered as to leave little to be added to the discussion. See also Wong Ah Gah v. United States, 94 Fed. 831; Wong Fong v. United States, 23 C. C. A. 110, 44 U. S. App. 674, 77 Fed. 168.\n It is true that the findings of the commissioner and in the district court in cases of this character should ordinarily be followed in this court, and will only be reconsidered when it is clear that an incorrect conclusion has been reached. Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 U.S. 193\n- 201, 46 L. ed. 1121-1126, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. But in the present case no new matter seems to have been admitted in the district court, and the finding made by the commissioner as to these appellants is of an uncertain nature when the judgment is read in connection with the special finding filed by that officer and made part of the record in each case, in which \n\n[193 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n he says: 'The proofs furnished in this case are sufficient to show that these three persons were engaged in business rather than in manual labor in 1894.'\n In this state of the record an examination thereof satisfies us that the appellants adduced testimony which established that they were bona fide 'merchants' within the meaning of the law at the time registration was required of laborers by the act of Congress, and, as the orders of deportation were made on the sole ground that appellants failed to show that fact, the judgments are reversed and appellants discharged. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

This writ of error was then sued out.\n The decision of the primary examiner was based upon rule 41 of practice in the Patent Office, and the case involves the validity of the rule under the patent laws.\n The petitioner filed an application in the Patent Office, November 21, 1896, for a patent for 'certain new and useful improvements in motor meters.' He expressed his invention in thirteen claims. They are inserted in the margin. \n\n 1. The herein-described method of measuring alternating electric currents, which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of magnetism from three intersecting lines or axes of magnetism and adapted to actuate a rotatable armature in a motor meter arranged within the energizing coils producing said lines of magnetization.\n\n 2. \nThe herein-described method of actuating an alternating-current motor meter, which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of magnetism from three intersecting lines or axes of magnetization, and adapted to actuate a rotatable armature arranged within the energizing coils producing said lines of magnetization.\n\n 3. \nThe herein-described method of actuating a single-phase alternating-current motor meter, which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of magnetism from three intersecting lines or axes of magnetization and adapted to actuate a rotatable armature arranged within the energizing coils producing said lines of magnetization.\n\n 4. \nThe herein-described method of actuating an alternating-current motor meter, which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of magnetism by means of magneto-motive forces acting along three intersecting lines and subjecting an armature to the inductive action of said field.\n\n 5. \nThe herein-described method of actuating an alternating-current motor meter, which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of magnetism by means of magneto-motive forces being proportional to the current and the other two to the electro-motive force, and subjecting an armature to the inductive action of said field.\n\n 6. \nThe herein-described method of actuating an alternating-current motor meter which consists in setting up or establishing a shifting field of mag- \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n The first six were held by the primary examiner to be claims for a process; the balance of the claims to be for an apparatus; and on the 15th of May, 1900, ordered that the latter, that is, claims 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, be canceled from the application. In other words, he required a division between the process claims and the apparatus claims, in accordance with rule 41. That rule is as follows: \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n'41. Two or more independent inventions cannot be claimed in one application; but where several distinct inventions are dependent upon each other and mutually contribute to produce a single result, they may be claimed in one application.\n\n'Claims for a machine and its product must be presented in separate applications.\n\n'Claims for a machine and the process in the performance of \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n which the machine is used must be presented in separate applications.\n\n'Claims for a process and its product may be presented in the same application.'\n\n Petitioner persisted in his application as filed, and the primary examiner repeated his order for a division of the claims. Petitioner regarded such order as 'a second final rejection' of his claims to the apparatus, and appealed therefrom to the board of examiners-in-chief. The primary examiner refused to answer the appeal and to forward the same with his answer thereto and the statements required by the rules of the Patent Office. Thereafter, on the 20th of August, 1900, petitioner petitioned the Commissioner of Patents to direct the primary examiner to forward said appeal, which petition was denied. It was repeated to the present Commissioner, defendant in error, and by him denied on the 7th of February, 1902\n\n\n These facts constitute petitioner's claim to relief.\n The answer of the respondent asserts the validity of rule 41, justifies the action of the Patent Office, alleges that petitioner is estopped from contesting the orders of the primary examiner, and also alleges that those orders 'did not involve the rejection of any claim or an action upon the merits of any claim made by the relator,' as provided in rule 13, and that 'the statutes and rule 133 of the rules of practice do not provide for an appeal to the examiners-in-chief from an examiner's requirement for division, and the examiners-in-chief have no jurisdiction to pass upon the question whether or not division should be required.'\n The answer presents also the following facts: Prior to making the order of May 15, 1900, to wit, on October 9, 1899, the primary examiner wrote a letter to petitioner regarding the division of the process claims and the apparatus claims, in accordance with rule 41, before further action would be given upon the merits of the case.\n Petitioner replied December 15, 1899, requesting 'that the \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n requirement for division be waived for the present,' in order that his process claims be placed in interference with the claims of a patent to one Duncan. To this request the examiner answered:\n'Pending the determination of the interference, applicant may retain the method and apparatus claims in this case, but the acceptance of an interference on one of the method claims will be held by the office to be an election of the prosecution of the method claims, and the further prosecution of the apparatus claims in this application will not be permitted.'\n\n Petitioner replied January 19, 1900, urging that the interference be declared, and on February 7, 1900, it was declared and decided in favor of petitioner. After the decision the examiner wrote the letter of May 15, 1900. These proceedings, respondent contends, constitute an estoppel.\n The first ruling of the Commissioner of Patents upon the petition to require the primary examiner to respond to petitioner's appeal was as follows:\n'Where applicant does not care to comply with the examiner's requirements in a matter of division such as is here involved, it has been the practice for the past thirty years to treat the question, not as one of merits, and appealable to the examiners-in-chief, but as a proper matter for petition to the Commissioner. I see no reason for overturning this practice. This petition is denied.'\n\n The second order of the Commissioner, respondent, after reciting certain of the facts, concluded as follows:\n'The requirement for division is purely a matter of form, not involving the merits of the claims, since the claims may be, and in the present case are, regarded as allowable. The examiner has not refused to grant a patent to this applicant upon any of the claims presented, but has merely required that they be included in two patents instead of one. It is a question of procedure, or of the manner of securing the protection, which is in controversy, and not the right of the applicant to a patent upon any of the claims presented. \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n 'The examiner was right in taking the position that the question involved is not appealable to the examiners-in-chief, and although it is a general rule of law that the appellate tribunal is the one to determine whether or not it has jurisdiction when an appeal is taken to it, it is not considered necessary in the office practice to follow that practice strictly, since the Commissioner is the head of the office and has the final decision upon all questions arising within it and may settle questions of this kind upon direct petition. The examiner's decision upon the question whether or not an appeal to the examiners-in-chief is regular and proper is not final, since it may be reviewed by the Commissioner upon petition, but he has authority to pass upon that question in the first instance.\n\n'The petition is denied.'\n\n Messrs. Frederick h. Betts and Melville Church for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 543, 553]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds, Solicitor General Hoyt, and Mr. John M. Coit for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 543, 555]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n 1. \nThe jurisdiction of this court to review the judgment of the court of appeals is questioned. There is no money in dispute nor anything to which a pecuniary value has been given. Jurisdiction is claimed under the clause of  8 of the act of February 9, 1893 [27 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 74 U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573], which gives an appeal to this court from the final judgment or decree of the court of appeals in cases in \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 556]\n\u00a0\n which there is drawn in question the validity of 'an authority exercised under the United States.'\n By  483 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 272), the Commissioner of Patents, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, is empowered to establish from time to time regulations not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of proceedings in the Patent Office. The Commissioner of Patents, exercising the power conferred, established, among other rules of practice, rule 41. It thereby became a rule of procedure, and constituted, in part, the powers of the primary examiner and Commissioner. In other words, it became an authority to those officers, and, necessarily, an authority 'under the United States.' Its validity was and is assailed by the plaintiff in error. We think, therefore, we have jurisdiction, and the motion to dismiss is denied.\n\n 2. \nThe issue is well defined between the parties, both as to the right and remedy, in the Patent Office. As to right, petitioner contends that a union by an inventor of process and apparatus claims, which are essentially the same invention, is given by the patent laws, and that rule 41, so far as it takes that right away, is repugnant to those laws, and invalid. As to remedy, that the decision of the primary examiner constituted a final decision upon the case, and petitioner was entitled to an appeal under the patent laws to the board of examiners-in-chief. The latter proposition depends upon the first. Assuming the right in an inventor as expressed in the first proposition, the primary examiner denied the right. True, a distinction can be made between his ruling and one on the merits, if we regard the merits to mean invention, novelty, or the like. But in what situation would an applicant for a patent be? If he yield to the rule he gives up his right of joinder. If he does not yield he will not be heard at all, and may subsequently be regarded as having abandoned his application. Section 4894, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3384). A ruling having such effect must be considered as final and appealable. Whether, however, to the examiners-in-chief or to the Commissioner, and \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 557]\n\u00a0\n from the latter to the courts, we may postpone answering until we have considered the right of an inventor to join process and apparatus claims in one application.\n Section 4886 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3382), provides as follows:\n'Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others in this country before his invention or discovery thereof, and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof, or more than two years prior to his application, and not in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to his application, unless the same is proved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other due proceeding had, obtain a patent therefor.'\n\n There is nothing in the language of the section which necessarily precludes the joinder of two or more inventions in the same application. But the section does distinguish inventions into arts (processes), machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter, and the earliest construction of the law denied the right of joinder. An exception, however, came to be made in cases of dependent and related inventions.\n In Hogg v. Emerson, 6 How. 437, 12 L. ed. 505, it was said:\n'The next objection is, that this description in the letters thus considered covers more than one patent and is therefore void.\n\n'There seems to have been no good reason at first unless it be a fiscal one on the part of the government when issuing patents, why more than one in favor of the same inventor should not be embraced in one instrument, like more than one tract of land in one deed or patent for land. Phillips, Patents, 217.\n\n'Each could be set out in separate articles or paragraphs, as different counts for different matters in libels in admiralty or declarations at common law, and the specifications could be made distinct for each, and equally clear.\n\n'But to obtain more revenue, the public officers have gen- \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 558]\n\u00a0\n erally declined to issue letters for more than one patent described in them. Renouard, Desbrevets D'Invention, 293; Phillips, Patents, 218. The courts have been disposed to acquiesce in the practice as conducive to clearness and certainty. And if letters issue otherwise inadvertently, to hold them, as a general rule, null. But it is a well established exception that patents may be united, if two or more, included in one set of letters, relate to a like subject, or are, in their nature or operation, connected together. Phillips Patents, 218, 219; Barrett v. Hall, 1 Mason, 447, Fed. Cas. No. 1,047; Moody v. Fiske, 2 Mason, 112, Fed. Cas. No. 9,745; Wyeth v. Stone, 1 Story, 273, Fed. Cas. No. 18,107.'\n\n This language would seem to imply that not the statute, but the practice of the Patent Office, required separate applications for inventions, but the cases cited were explicit of the meaning of the statute. Mr. Justice Story, in Wyeth v. Stone, said:\n'For, if different inventions might be joined in the same patent for entirely different purposes and objects, the patentee would be at liberty to join as many as he might choose, at his own mere pleasure, in one patent, which seems to be inconsistent with the language of the patent acts, which speak of the thing patented, and not of the things patented, and of a patent for invention, and not of a patent for inventions; and they direct a specific sum to be paid for each patent.'\n\n But he confined the requirement to independent inventions, and his illustrations in dicated that he meant by independent inventions not those which, though distinct, were 'for the same common purpose and auxiliary to the same common end.'\n Hogg v. Emerson came to this court again and is reported in 11 How. 587, 13 L. ed. 824. Of one of the objections to the patent the court said:\n'It is that the improvement thus described is for more than one invention, and that one set of letters patent for more than one invention is not tolerated by law.\n\n'But grant that such is the result when two or more inventions are entirely separate and independent,-though this is doubtful on principle,- yet it is well settled, in the cases formerly cited, that a patent for more than one invention is not void if \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 559]\n\u00a0\n they are connected in their design and operation. This last is clearly the case here.'\n\n Many other cases are to the same effect.\n Can it be said that a process and an apparatus are inevitably so independent as never to be 'connected in their design and operation?' They may be completely independent. Cochrane v. Deener, \n94 U.S. 780\n, 24 L. ed. 139. But they may be related. They may approach each other so nearly that it will be difficult to distinguish the process from the function of the apparatus. In such case the apparatus would be the dominant thing. But the dominance may be reversed and the process carry an exclusive right, no matter what apparatus may be devised to perform it. There is an illustration in the Telephone Cases, \n126 U.S. 1\n, 31 L. ed. 863, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778. The claim passed upon in those cases was as follows:\n'The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially at set forth.'\n\n The claim was held to refer to the art described, and the means of making it useful. The court observed:\n'Other inventors may compete with him for the ways of giving effect to the discovery, but the new art he has found will belong to him and those claiming under him during the life of his patent.'\n\n A distinction between the process and the means employed for using it was recognized. It was said:\n'The patent for the art does not necessarily involve a patent for the particular means employed for using it. Indeed, the mention of any means, in the specification or descriptive portion of the patent, is only necessary to show that the art can be used; for it is only useful arts- arts which may be used to advantage-that can be made the subject of a patent.'\n\n The patent was sustained. It was not attacked because it embraced independent inventions. The fact is not without \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 560]\n\u00a0\n force. Considering the ability of counsel engaged and the division of the court in opinion, it is a proper inference that no tenable objection to the patent was overlooked.\n It is said by Robinson, in his work on Patents, that 'special rules which govern the joinder of arts or processes with each other or with related inventions of a different class, are more stringent in the Patent Office than in the courts.' 2 Robinson, Patents,  473. And the author deduces the conclusion that under the rules of the Patent Office a process cannot be 'joined with the apparatus that performs it, nor either of these with the product in which they result, unless they are to such an extent inseparable that the existence of some one of them is dependent upon that of the others.' But rule 41 precludes even this.\n If there is a divergence of views between the courts and the Patent Office, and the divergence proceeds from a different interpretation of the statute, the views of the courts ought to prevail. If the courts, however, have only recognized and enforced the exercise of a discretion of the Patent Office, the question occurs, What is the extent of such discretion, and can it be expressed and fixed in an inflexible rule such as rule 41? In Bennet v. Fowler, 8 Wall. 445, 19 L. ed. 431, a discretion in the Patent Office was recognized. The question arose upon the validity of two reissued patents for improvements, which 'had been embraced in one, in the original patent.' The court said:\n'It may be that if the improvements set forth in both specifications had been incorporated into one patent, the patentee taking care to protect himself as to all his improvements by proper and several claims, it would have been sufficient. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to lay down any general rule by which to determine when a given invention or improvements shall be embraced in one, two, or more patents. Some discretion must necessarily be left on this subject to the head of the Patent Office. It is often a nice and perplexing question.'\n\n Some discretion is not an unlimited discretion, and if the \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 561]\n\u00a0\n discretion be not unlimited it is reviewable. In other words, the statute gives the right to join inventions in one application in cases where the inventions are related, and it cannot be denied by a hard and fixed rule which prevents such joinder in all cases. Such a rule is not the exercise of discretion; it is a determination not to hear. No inventor can reach the point of invoking the discretion of the Patent Office. He is notified in advance that he will not be heard, no matter what he might be able to show. His right is denied, therefore; not regulated. Such is the necessary effect of rule 41, as amended.\n Without that rule the action of the Patent Office can be accommodated to the character of inventions, and discretion can be exercised, and when exercised, we may say in passing, except in cases of clear abuse, the courts will not review it. But the rule as amended, as we have said, precludes the exercise of any judgment, and compels the separation of claims for a process and claims for its apparatus, however related or connected they may be. And the right denied is substantial. Counsel for petitioner have explained that right by the embarrassments caused by its denial, one of which is that, by disclosing the apparatus in his application for the process, he might lose the right to and a patent for the apparatus; and to sustain that view James v. Campbell, \n104 U.S. 356\n, 26 L. ed. 786, is cited. We are not prepared to admit such consequences nor that James v. Campbell so decides. If the classification of the statute makes a distinction between the different kinds of inventions- between a process and an apparatus-and requires or permits a separate application for each, it would seem to follow irresistibly that an application and patent for one would not preclude an application and patent for the other, and the order of the application could not affect the right which the law confers. James v. Campbell was a case of reissued patent, and by express provision of the statute as to reissued patents no new matter can be introduced in them. In other words, the reissue is to perfect, not to enlarge, the prior patent. Whether the principle of the case applies to \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 562]\n\u00a0\n related as well as to independent inventions is not clear from its language. The court said:\n'Where a new process produces a new substance, the invention of the process is the same as the invention of the substance, and a patent for the one may be reissued so as to include both, as was done in the case of Goodyear's vulcanized rubber patent. But a process, and a machine for applying the process are not necessarily one and the same invention.'\n\n The facts of the case did not call for a more definite ruling. The original patent was for a device for postmarking and canceling postage stamps by a single blow. The reissued patent claimed the act of marking and cancelation, and it was observed by the court:\n'The process or act of making a postmark and canceling a postage stamp by a single blow or operation, as a subject of invention, is a totally different thing in the patent law from a stamp constructed for performing that process.'\n\n But without attempting to enlarge the case and extend it to more intimately related inventions, it is enough now to say that there is nothing in the case which decides that if the process had been claimed in an independent application it (the process) would have been adjudged to have been dedicated to the public by the other patent. There is language indicating the contrary. It was said:\n'If he [the patentee] was the author of any other invention than that which he specifically describes and claims, though he might have asked to have it patented at the same time and in the same patent, yet if he has not done so, and afterwards desires to secure it, he is bound to make a new and distinct application for that purpose, and make it the subject of a new and different patent.'\n\n The case, however, indicates what embarrassment and peril of rights may be caused by a hard and fixed rule regarding the separation of related inventions. See also Mosler Safe & Lock Co. v. Mosler, \n127 U.S. 354\n, 32 L. ed. 182, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148, and Miller v. Eagle Mfg. Co. \n151 U.S. 186\n, 38 L. ed. 121, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 310. \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 563]\n\u00a0\n The Patent Office has not been consistent in its views in regard to the division of inventions. At times convenience of administration has seemed to be of greatest concern; at other times more anxiety has been shown for the rights of inventors. The policy of the office has been denominated that of 'battledore and shuttlecock,' and rule 41 as it now exists was enacted to give simplicity and uniformity to the practice of the office. Its enactment was attempted to be justified by the assumption that the patent laws gave to the office a discretion to permit or deny a joinder of inventions. But, as we have already said, to establish a rule applicable to all cases is not to exercise discretion. Such a rule ignores the differences which invoke discretion, and which can alone justify its exercise, and we are of opinion therefore that rule 41 is an invalid regulation.\n\n 3. \nHaving settled the right of appellant, we may now return to the consideration of his remedy. Respondent contends:\n'It is fundamental that mandamus will not issue against a public officer, except to compel the performance of some plain, clear, ministerial duty, and will not issue to control his discretion.'\n\n And it is further contended that respondent has acted, and, having acted, cannot be required to refer the case to a lower tribunal in his office. To sustain the contention Holloway v. Whiteley, 4 Wall. 522, 18 L. ed. 335, is cited.\n The unity of the inventions claimed by petitioner in the case at bar we may assume. It is not denied by respondent. Petitioner had, therefore, the right to join them in one application. The denial of this right by the primary examiner was a rejection of the application and entitled petitioner to an appeal to the examiners-in-chief, under  4909 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3390). That sections provides:\n'Every applicant for a patent, . . . any of the claims of which have been twice rejected, . . . may appeal from the decision of the primary examiner to the board of examiners-in-chief; . . .' \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 564]\n\u00a0\n The  482 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 272), provides:\n\n'The examiners-in-chief shall be persons of competent legal knowledge and scientific ability, whose duty it shall be, on the written petition of the appellant, to revise and determine upon the validity of the adverse decisions of examiners upon applications for patents, and for reissues of patents, and in interference cases; and, when required by the Commissioner, they shall hear and report upon claims for extensions, and perform such other like duties as he may assign them.'\n\n The procedure on appeal is provided for by the rules of the Patent Office. It is taken by filing a petition praying an appeal with the primary examiner, setting forth the reasons upon which the appeal is based, and it is made the duty of the examiner, five days before the date of hearing, to funish the appellate tribunal and the appellant with a statement of the grounds of his decision. A petition praying an appeal was filed, but the primary examiner refused to answer the appeal, and the defendant in error also refused to direct him to answer it. It is manifest that if an appeal cannot be compelled from the decision of the primary examiner, an applicant is entirely without remedy. And respondent has asserted that extreme. In Ex parte Frasch, 20 App. D. C. 298, the court of appeals of the District of Columbia was persuaded that an appeal was not the proper remedy. In the case at bar it is contended that mandamus is not the proper one. One or the other must be. A suggestion made is that the inventor must await a decision on the merits, meaning by merits 'lack of invention, novelty, or utility,' as expressed in rule 133. But after waiting he would encounter the arbitrary requirement of rule 41. Besides, what would there be to review if the order of the primary examiner were complied with and the claims put into separate applications? There are some observations in Holloway v. Whiteley, which may be quoted. Whitely claimed to be the assignee of a patent, and filed an application for a reissue. The Commissioner declined to entertain it on the ground that Whitely was only assignee of an interest, and not of the entirc patent. He also \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 565]\n\u00a0\n declined to allow an appeal to be taken from his decision. The supreme court of the District of Columbia awarded a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding the Commissioner to refer the application to the proper examiner, or otherwise examine or cause it to be examined according to law. Error was prosecuted to this court. Under the act of 1836 [5 Stat. at L. p. 117, chap. 357], it was provided that if the Commissioner decided adversely to an applicant for a patent an appeal could be taken to the board of examiners, and by the act of 1837 [5 Stat. at L. 191, chap. 45], that remedy was given to an applicant for a reissue of a patent, and the question in the case was whether that remedy should have been pursued. In other words, whether the remedy was by appeal or mandamus. It was decided that appeal was the remedy. Singularly enough, the Commissioner, in answer to the rule, took the position that the application was not before him because it had not been filed. The court said if that were so 'mandamus would clearly lie to compel the Commissioner to receive it. It was his first duty to receive the application, whatever he might do subsequently. Without this initial step there could be no examination, and, indeed, no rightful knowledge of the subject on his part. Examination and the exercise of judgment, with their proper fruit, were to follow, and they did follow.'\n And so the exercise of judgment might follow a hearing of the application under review. It was the duty of the primary examiner to accord a hearing or, refusing to do so, to grant an appeal. It was the duty of the Commissioner to compel the appeal. The Commissioner of Patents is primarily charged with granting and issuing patents. Applications for patents are made to him ( 4888, Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3383), and his superintendence should be exercised to secure the rights which the statutes confer on inventors. The first of those rights is a hearing. If that be denied other rights cannot accrue.\n The Commissioner justifies his decision by the rules of the Patent Office and a long practice under them. If there is inconsistency between the rules and statute, the latter must pre- \n\n[192 U.S. 543, 566]\n\u00a0\n vail. But the primary examiner did not follow the rules. The rules provide that if appeal be regular in form (italics ours) he shall, within five days of the filing thereof, furnish the examiners-in-chief with a written statement of the grounds of his decision on all of the points involved in the appeal, with copies of the rejected claims and with the references applicable thereto. If he decide that the appeal is not regular in form, a petition from such decision may be made directly to the Commissioner. The regularity of the appeal in form is not questioned in the case at bar, and it was the duty of the examiner to answer the appeal by furnishing the examiners-in-chief the statement provided for in rule 135. A petition to the Commissioner was not necessary except to make the examiner to perform his duty.\n\n 4. \nWe do not think that petitioner was estopped from insisting upon his application by proceeding with the interference with Duncan after the examiner's letter of December 15, 1899. It would be pressing mere order of procedure and the convenience of the Patent Office too far to give them such result under the circumstances.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, with directions to reverse that of the Supreme Court, and direct the Supreme Court to grant the writ of mandamus as prayed for. \n\nFootnotes\n netism by means of magneto-motive forces acting along three intersecting lines, one magneto-motive force being proportional to the current and the other two to the electro-motive force, the several magneto-motive forces being so proportioned and related to each other that the resultant of the last two is displaced in phase from the first by the complement of the angle of lag, and subjecting an armature to the inductive action of said field. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] In a Watt meter for alternating electric. currents, means for producing a magnetic flux proportional to the current and varying in phase therewith, means for producing a second magnetic flux proportional to the electromotive force and lagging in phase behind the same, and means for producing an auxiliary flux along a line at an angle to said second flux, and of such magnitude and phase that the resultant of the two last- mentioned fluxes will lag behind the first by the complement of the angle of lag. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The combination in an electro motor of a field-magnet system and means for inducing therein magnetic fluxes of three phases, one a flux due to a series coil and proportional to the current, a second flux due to a shunt potential coil and lagging behind the electro-motive force, and a third flux lagging behind said second flux and having a fixed angular relation thereto such that the resultant of the second and third fluxes is dephased by substantially the complement of the angle of lag from the flux due to the series coil. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The combination in a recording electric meter of a field-magnet system acting on the armature and having a plurality of intersecting magnetic axes, means for inducing along one of said magnetic axes a flux proportional to the current and varying in phase therewith, and means for inducing along the other magnetic axes a plurality of other fluxes dependent upon the potential of the metered circuit, which lag behind the electro-motive force by different amounts and act upon the armature at different points, said fluxes being so proportioned in value and phase that their joint action upon the armature will enable the meter to register the true energy consumed in an alternating-current circuit without being substantially affected by changes of phase relation. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] In a Watt meter for alternating currents, the combination of a field-magnet system having three intersecting magnetic axes, means for producing along one of said axes a magnetic flux proportional to the current and varying in phase therewith means for producing along another of said axes an alternating flux proportional to the electro-motive force and lagging behind the same, and means for producing along the third axis an auxiliary magnetic flux also proportional to the electro-motive force, of such a magnitude and phase that the joint action of the several fluxes upon the armature will enable the meter to register the true energy consumed in an alternating-current circuit without being substantially affected by changes of phase relation. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] In a meter for alternating currents, the combination of a field- magnet system having three intersecting magnetic axes, means for producing along one of said axes a magnetic flux proportional to the current and varying in phase therewith, means for producing along another of said axes an \n alternating flux proportional to the electro-motive force and lagging behind the same, and means for producing along the third axes an auxiliary magnetic flux also proportional to the electro-motive force and of such magnitude and phase that the joint action of the two potential fluxes upon the armature will produce a torque sufficient to overcome the static friction of the meter. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] In a single-phase alternating current meter, the combination of a field-magnet system having three intersecting magnetic axes, a field coil in which the current phase varies as the conditions of the circuit change, producing a magnetization along one magnetic axis, a potential coil producing a magnetization along another magnetic axis, a reactance device in series with said potential coil for lagging the current behind the electro-motive force, and a second potential coil depending for its current upon the first potential coil, producing a magnetization along the third magnetic axis;

The essential facts stated in the findings are as follows:\n In 1856 Congress granted to the state of Alabama public lands to aid in the construction of various railroads referred to in the 1st and 6th sections of the act. Among these was the Northeast & Southwestern Railroad, 'from near Gadsden to some point on the Alabama and Mississippi state line, in the direction of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, and with a view to connect with said Mobile & Ohio Railroad.' The grant of land in place was six odd- numbered sections per mile, and lying within six sections in width on each side of the railroad. The act, in  1, also contained a provision for indemnity lands, as follows:\n'But in case it shall appear that the United States have, \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n when the lines or routes of said roads are definitely fixed, sold any sections or any parts thereof, granted as aforesaid, or that the right of pre-emption has attached to the same, then it shall be lawful for any agent or agents, to be appointed by the governor of said state, to select, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, from the lands of the United States nearest to the tiers of sections above specified, so much land, in alternate sections, or parts of sections, as shall be equal to such lands as the United States have sold, or otherwise appropriated, or to which the rights of pre-emption have attached as aforesaid, which lands (thus selected in lieu of those sold, and to which pre-emption rights have attached, as aforesaid, together with the sections and parts of sections designated by odd numbers, as aforesaid, and appropriated as aforesaid) shall be held by the state of Alabama, for the use and purpose aforesaid: Provided, that the land to be so located shall in no case be further than fifteen miles from the lines of said roads, and selected for and on account of each of said roads.'\n\n The act, in  6, moreover, contained this proviso:\n'That the lands hereby granted to said state for the purpose of constructing a railroad from the northeast to the southwestern portion of said state, lying northwest of Elyton, shall be assigned to such road as may be designated by the legislature of said state.'\n\n It was further in substance provided, in  4, that if any of the authorized roads were not completed within ten years, all right of the state in and to the lands granted should cease, and they should revert to the United States. 11 Stat. at L. chap. 41, pp. 17, 18.\n By joint resolution of the legislature of the state of Alabama, approved January 30, 1858, the grant made by the act aforesaid was accepted, and land was granted by the state to the Northeast & Southwestern Alabama Railroad, a body corporate, existing under the laws of Alabama, to be used and applied by said company 'upon the terms and conditions in said act of Congress contained.' Laws of Alabama, 1857 to \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n 1858, p. 430. In June, 1856, an order of withdrawal was made by the Land Department of all the lands which were thought to be embraced within both the place and indemnity limits, which withdrawal included the land to which this controversy relates. This order was modified a few days thereafter so as to allow settlements to be made on the lands prior to the time of the definite location of the road. Such definite location was made and accepted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, in December, 1858\n\n\n The Northeast & Southwestern Railroad was reincorporated by the state of Alabama in October, 1868, under the name of the Alabama & Chattanooga Railroad Company. Acts of Alabama, 1868, pp. 207, 345. In April, 1869, the time for the completion of the road was extended by act of Congress for a period of three years from that date. 16 Stat. at L. 45, chap. 24. The road was completed within the extended time, in conformity with the law of Alabama, and in compliance with the act of Congress.\n In December, 1887, an agent, duly appointed by the governor of Alabama for that purpose, selected certain lands in the indemnity limits in lieu of lands within the place limits, which had been lost to the grantee by sale or pre-emption. At the time of making the selections there were tendered to the proper land officers all legal fees and charges. The selections were rejected by the local officers, and an appeal was taken to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. This appeal, however, was not acted upon for a considerable period of time; but finally, in April, 1896, the appeal was decided in favor of the selections, which were approved, and the title consequently passed from the United States to the state of Alabama, in trust for its grantees, under the act of Congress. At the time of the definite location of the road there was a deficiency in the place limits of 519,000 acres, and the whole amount of the vacant or odd- numbered sections within the indemnity limits, both approved and unapproved, available \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n to meet this deficiency, was less than 238,000 acres, leaving, therefore, on the face of the Land Office records, at the time of the definite location of the road, a deficiency of more than 281,000 acres. By various acts of the legislature of the state of Alabama, and conveyances which are recited in the findings, and which it is not necessary to reproduce, the plaintiffs below became the owners of the land patented by the United States, within the indemnity limits, as above stated. During the period, however, which intervened between the selections of land made by the agent of the state of Alabama and the approval of the selections by the Secretary of the Interior, certain persons went upon the lands selected, and removed therefrom valuable iron ore and lime rock. After the approval of the selections the United States brought a suit to recover from the persons who had thus trespassed upon the lands the value of the product by them removed. The owners of the land, in pursuance of the selections, asserted a claim to the benefit of the recovery which might be made, but assented to a compromise made by the United States with the trespassers by which $15,000 was paid to the United States as the value of the material taken from the land. The owners of the land at the time of the compromise protested that they alone were entitled to receive the sum paid to the United States, and reserved their right to recover the same from the United States.\n It is stated in the findings that a road known as the South & North Alabama Railroad, declared to be one of the roads enumerated in the 6th section of the act of Congress making the grant to the state of Alabama, was definitely located opposite the land in controversy on May 30, 1866, nearly eight years after the definite location of the Northeast & Southwestern Railroad, and was constructed within the time required by law. There is no finding, however, that a grant was ever made to the South & North Alabama Railroad by the state of Alabama, or that that road preferred any claim to the land in question. \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. George H. Walker for appellant.\n Messrs. M. D. Brainard and J. A. W. Smith for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n As there is no finding which tends even to establish any right at any time to the land in question in favor of the South & North Alabama Railroad, all consideration of that subject may be put out of view. Moreover, the existence of any supposed right in favor of that company is conclusively disposed of on this record by the finding as to the prior selection by the state of Alabama under the grant in aid of the Northeast & Southwestern Railroad, and the approval of such selection by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The government makes no contention that if the title of the plaintiffs was of such a character as to entitle them generally to recover against the trespassers, that the cause of action against the United States for the money collected by it from the trespassers is not one which is judicially cognizable. The sole contention of the government is that the plaintiffs, after application for selections, and before approval of the selections, had no such title to the land as would have justified a recovery from the trespassers and, a fortiori, therefore, had no such title as would warrant their recovering from the United States the sum of money which it collected from the trespassers for the elements removed from the land during the period between the date of the application for selections and the approval of the same by the Secretary of the Interior. This contention is based upon the proposition that, whilst under the act in question the grant rights to be acquired by third parties, to the been one in praesenti, the right to the indemnity of land within the place limits may have until approval of the selections by the proper officers of the government; and hence, the legal title was in the United States as to such lands, pending action on the applica- \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n tion for selections, and therefore at the time of the trespass the United States was alone authorized to recover for the depredations committed. Unquestionably the general doctrine is that where approval by the officers of the government of selections of indemnity land has been made a condition precedent to the right to take such lands, the legal title remains in the United States until devested by the approval of the selections. Oregon & C. R. Co. v. United States, \n189 U.S. 103\n, 47 L. ed. 726, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 615. In consonance with this doctrine it has also been decided that, until approval of selections within the indemnity limits, land embraced in applications for selections remains the property of the United States to such an extent that it cannot be taxed as the property of the applicants. Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 U.S. 496\n, 33 L. ed. 687, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341.\n But even though it be conceded, arguendo, that the doctrine in question would allow rights to be acquired by third parties, to the injury of the applicant, after the making of the selections, and pending approval thereof by the government, it does not follow that it controls the controversy here presented. This results because, on this record, the rights of third parties are not involved, since the controversy concerns only the right of the United States to retain, as against its grantees, the proceeds recovered by it as the result of a trespass upon land after an application for the selection of such land, and pending action thereon by the proper officers of the government. Under these circumstances the case is one for the application of the fiction of relation, by which, in the interest of justice, a legal title is held to relate back to the initiatory step for the acquisition of the land. Many cases illustrating the doctrine in various aspects have been determined in this court. \n Indeed, this case is one coming peculiarly within the principle of relation, as the approval of the selections manifestly \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n imported that at the time of the application for selections the land in question was rightfully claimed by the applicant. And cogently does this become the case when it is considered that the findings establish that at the time the application for selection was made, on the face of the records of the Land Office, there was an enormous deficiency, both in the place and indemnity lands. Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 \nU.S. 330, 337\n, 23 S. L. ed. 424, 426.\n Nor is the assertion well founded that this case is not a proper one for the application of the doctrine of relation, because coming within the rule announced in United States v. Lougrey, \n172 U.S. 206\n, 43 L. ed. 420, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 153. At the time of the trespass complained of in that case the United States had taken no step to assert its reversionary rights in and to the land trespassed upon, the legal title to which was in the state of Michigan at the time the trespass was committed. Here, as we have seen, the grantee had exercised his right to apply for selections within the indemnity limits, and had, in legal form, requested the approval of the same by the government. Everything, therefore, which the grantee was required by law to do to obtain the legal title and been performed. These facts bring this case within the principle decided in Heath v. Ross, 12 Johns. 140, and Musser v. McRae, 44 Minn. 343, 46 N. W. 673, referred, to in the opinion of the court in the Loughrey Case (p. 218, L. ed. p. 424, Sup. Ct. Rep. pp. 157, 158) as not being inconsistent with the principle there applied. Heath v. Ross was an action of trover for timber cut between the application for and date of a patent from the state, and its ensealing and delivery by the secretary of state. The title was held to relate back to the first act, so as to entitle the plaintiff to maintain an action against a mere wrongdoer, for the value of the timber cut and carried away in the meantime. Musser v. McRea was an action brought to recover the value of timber cut by trespassers from indemnity lands selected by the agent of certain raidroad companies, intermediate the application for selection and the patenting of the lands. To permit a recovery, it was held that the title evidenced by the patent related back at least to the date of the application for \n\n[194 U.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n selection. It was declared that the doctrine of relation was properly applied to the case, 'for the advancement of justice, and to give the full effect to the grant it was intended to have.' Among other cases relied upon by the Minnesota court as sustaining the application made of the doctrine was the decision of this court in Landes v. Brant, 10 How. 372, 13 L. ed. 459.\n Concluding, as we do, that the money in question belongs to the appellee as the successor in interest of the party for whose benefit the application for selections was made, it results that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Gibson v.

CHOCTAW NATION(1904)\nNo. 322\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt for the United States. \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 115]\n\u00a0\n These are cross appeals from a decree of the court of claims, entered in a suit brought under an agreement between the United States and the Choctaw and the Chickasaw Indians, made the 21st of March, 1902, and ratified and affirmed by the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 649, chap. 1362).\n The controversy is as to the relations of the Chickasaw freedmen to the Chickasaw Nation, and the rights of such freedmen, independent of such agreement, in the lands of the said Indian nations under the 3d article of the treaty of 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 769] between the United States and the said nations, and under \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 116]\n\u00a0\n any and all laws subsequently enacted by the Chickasaw legislature or by Congress.\n There is no dispute about the facts. They are substantially as follows: By treaty of October 20, 1832 [7 Stat. at L. 381] the Chickasaw Indians ceded to the United States, for the purpose of sale, their land east of the Mississippi river, and later were permitted to migrate west of that river. By the treaty between the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes of June 17, 1837, the Chickasaw tribe was permitted to occupy, with the Choctaw tribe, certain territory within the United States, the United States confirming the treaty and such occupation by a treaty with the tribes June 22, 1855 [11 Stat. at L. 611]. By this treaty the lands were guaranteed 'to the members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, their heirs and successors, to be held in common; so that each and every member of either tribe shall have an equal undivided interest in the whole.' By said treaty the said tribes leased to the United States 'all that portion of their common territory west of the ninety-eighth degree of west longitude' for the settlement of the Wichita and other tribes of Indians. The leased territory was also to be opened to the settlement by Choctaws and Chickasaws. This is the 'leased district' hereinafter referred to. The Choctaws and Chickasaws are separate nations. Upon the breaking out of the Civil War they entered into relations with the Southern confederacy, and took up arms against the United States. On January 1, 1863 [12 Stat. at L. 1268], the President of the United States, in pursuance of the proclamation of September 22, 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 1267], issued a proclamation abolishing slavery.\n The appellants in No. 323 are the survivors or descendants of the slaves held by the Chickasaw Nation, and number about 9,066. The Creeks, Cherokees, and Seminoles also rebelled against the United States, and on the 10th of September, 1865, a treaty was entered into at Fort Smith, Arkansas, between them, said Choctaws and Chickasaws and the United States, by which they and the said Choctaws and Chickasaws renewed their allegiance to the United States, and acknowledged themselves to be under the protection of the United States, and covenanted and agreed that thereafter they would in all things recognize the \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n government of the United States, which should exercise exclusive jurisdiction over them. The United States on its part promised to afford ample protection for the security of the persons and property of the respective nations or tribes. The treaty was ratified by the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation.\n A treaty was concluded between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, and proclaimed July 10, 1866. It provided, among other things, as follows:\n'Article II. The Choctaws and Chickasaws hereby covenant and agree that henceforth neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, otherwise than in punishment of crime, whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted in accordance with laws applicable to all members of the particular nation, shall ever exist in said nations.\n\n'Article III. The Choctaws and Chickasaws, in consideration of the sum of three hundred thousand dollars, hereby cede to the United States the territory west of the 98 west longitude, known as the leased district, provided that the said sum shall be invested and held by the United States, at an interest not less than five per cent, in trust for the said nations, until the legislatures of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, respectively, shall have made such laws, rules, and regulations as may be necessary to give all the persons of African descent, resident in the said nations at the date of the treaty of Fort Smith, and their descendants, heretofore held in slavery among said nations, all the rights, privileges, and immunities, including the right of suffrage, of citizens of said nations, except in the annuities, moneys, and public domain claimed by or belonging to said nations, respectively; and also to give to such persons who were residents, as aforesaid, and their descendants, forty acres each of the land of said nations on the same terms as the Choctaws and Chickasaws, to be selected on the survey of said land, after the Choctaws and Chickasaws and Kansas Indians have made their selections as herein provided; and immediately on the enactment of such laws, rules, and regulations the said sum of three hundred thousand dollars shall be paid to the said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations in the proportion \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n of three-fourths to the former and one-fourth to the latter,-less such sum, at the rate of one hundred dollars per capita, as shall be sufficient to pay such persons of African descent before referred to as, within ninety days after the passage of such laws, rules, and regulations, shall elect to remove and actually remove from the said nations, respectively. And should said laws, rules, and regulations not be made by the legislatures of the said nations, respectively, within two years from the ratification of this treaty, then the said sum of three hundred thousand dollars shall cease to be held in trust for the said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, and be held for the use and benefit of such of said persons of African descent as the United States shall remove from the said Territory in such manner as the United States shall deem proper,-the United States agreeing, within ninety days from the expiration of the said two years, to remove from said nations all such persons of African descent as may be willing to remove; those remaining or returning after having been removed from said nations to have no benefit of said sum of three hundred thousand dollars, or any part thereof, but shall be upon the same footing as other citizens of the United States in the said nations.' [14 Stat. at L. 769.]\n\n The legislature of the Chickasaw Nation has taken action at various times in regard to the said Chickasaw freedmen, as follows:\n On November 9, 1866, the Chickasaw legislature passed an act declaring it to be the unanimous desire of the legislature that the United States hold the share of the Chickasaw Nation in the $300,000, stipulated for the cession of the 'leased district,' for the benefit of the Chickasaw freedmen, and remove them beyond the limits of the Chickasaw Nation, according to the 3d article of the treaty of 1866\n\n\n In 1868 similar action was taken by the Chickasaw legislature, asking for the removal, by the United, states, of the Chickasaw freedmen from the Chickasaw country.\n January 10, 1873, the Chickasaw legislature passed an act by which the freedmen were declared to be adopted in conformity by the United States, of the Chickasaw Certain conditions were expressed, and it was provided that the act \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n should 'be in full force and effect from and after its approval by the proper authority of the United States.'\n That act was transmitted by the governor of the Chickasaw Nation, by letter of the same date, to the President of the United States, and was submitted by the Secretary of the Interior to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on February 10, 1873, with recommendation for appropriate legislation for extending the time for the execution of the 3d article of the treaty. The papers were referred to the committee on freedmen affairs, but no action thereon was had at that time.\n In October, 1876 or 1877, another act was passed,  3 of which was as follows:\n'Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, that the provisions contained in article 3 of the said treaty, giving the Chickasaw legislature the choice of receiving and appropriating the three hundred thousand dollars therein named for the use and benefit, or passing such laws, rules, and regulations as will give all persons of African descent certain rights and privileges, be, and it is hereby, declared to be the unanimous consent of the Chickasaw legislature that the United States shall keep and hold said sum of three hundred thousand dollars for the benefit of the said negroes, and the governor of the Chickasaw Nation is hereby requested to notify the government of the United States that it is the wish of the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation that the government of the United States remove the said negroes beyond the limits of the Chickasaw Nation, according to the requirements of the third article of the treaty of April 28, 1866.'\n\n An act passed October 22, 1885, provided, inter alia, as follows:\n'Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation, That the Chickasaw people hereby refuse to accept or adopt the freedmen as citizens of the Cherokee Nation upon any terms or conditions whatever, and respectfully request the governor of our nation to notify the department at Washington of the action of the legislature in the premises.\n\n'Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, that the governor is hereby \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n authorized and directed to appoint two competent and discreet men of good judgment and business qualifications to visit Washington city, D. C., during the next session of Congress, and memorialize that bokdy to provide a means of removal of the freedmen from the Chickasaw Nation to the country known as Oklahoma, in the Indian that body to provide a means of removal of of the freedmen question, so that they be not forced upon us as equal citizens of the Chickasaw Nation.'\n\n Congress took no action until August 15, 1894, when it passed an act ,  18 of which provided--\n'That the approval of Congress is hereby given to 'An Act to Adopt the Negroes of the Chickasaw Nation,' and so forth, passed by the legislature of the Chickasaw Nation and approved by the governor thereof January 10, 1873, particularly as set forth in a letter from the Secretary of the Interior transmitting to Congress a copy of the aforesaid act contained in House Executive Document numbered two hundred and seven, Forty-second Congress, third session.' 28 Stat. at L. 336, chap. 290.\n\n Subsequently, April 23, 1897, an agreement was entered into between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. The agreement, ratified and confirmed by the act of June 28, 1898,  29 (30 Stat. at. L. 505, chap. 517), provides, inter alia, as follows:\n'That all the lands within the Indian territory belonging to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians shall be allotted to the members of said tribes, so as to give to each member of these tribes, so far as possible, a fair and equal share thereof, considering the character and fertility of the soil and the location and value of the lands. . . .\n\n'The lands allotted to the Choctaw and Chickasaw freedmen are to be deducted from the portion to be allotted under this agreement to the members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribe so as to reduce the allotment to the Choctaws and Chickasaws by the value of the same.\n\n'That the said Choctaw and Chickasaw freedmen who may be entitled to allotments of 40 acres each shall be entitled \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n each to land equal in value to 40 acres of the average land of the two nations.'\n\n These provisions relative to the freedmen are previously qualified as to their holdings of such lands by this clause in the statute: 'to be selected, held, and used by them until their rights under said treaty shall be determined, in such manner as shall hereafter be provided by act of Congress.'\n Then came the agreement of 1902. It provides for the allotment of land to each member of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes of 320 acres, and to each freedman 'land equal in value to 40 acres of the average allottable land of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.'\n The agreement provides also as follows:\n'36. Authority is hereby conferred upon the court of claims to determine the existing controversy respecting the relations of the Chickasaw freedmen to the Chickasaw Nation and the rights of such freedmen in the lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations under the third article of the treaty of eighteen hundred and sixty-six between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and under any and all laws subsequently enacted by the Chickasaw legislature or by Congress.\n\n'37. To that end the Attorney General of the United States is hereby directed, on behalf of the United States, to file in said court of claims, within sixty days after this agreement becomes effective, a bill of interpleader against the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and the Chickasaw freedmen setting forth the existing controversy between the Chickasaw Nation and the Chickasaw freedmen, and praying that the defendants thereto be required to interplead and settle their respective rights in such suit.'\n\n'Sec. 40. In the meantime the commission to the Five Civilized Tribes shall make a roll of the Chickasaw freedmen and their descendants, as provided in the Atoka agreement, and shall make allotments to them as provided in this agreement, which said allotments shall be held by the said Chickasaw freedmen, not as temporary allotments, but as final allotments, and in the event that it shall be finally determined in said suit that \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n the Chickasaw freedmen are not, independently of this agreement, entitled to allotments in the Choctaw and Chickasaw lands, the court of claims shall render a decree in favor of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations according to their respective interests, and against the United States, for the value of the lands so allotted to the Chickasaw freedmen as ascertained by the appraisal thereof made by the commission to the Five Civilized Tribes for the purpose of allotment, which decree shall take the place of the said lands and shall be in full satisfaction of all claims by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations against the United States or the said freedmen on account of the taking of the said lands for allotment to said freedmen: Provided, That nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to affect or change the existing status or rights of the two tribes as between themselves respecting the lands taken for allotment to freedmen, or the money, if any, recovered as compensation therefor, as aforesaid.' [32 Stat. at L. 649, chap. 1362.]\n\n The agreement was ratified by the Choctaws and Chickasaws by elections September 25, 1902, and became effective on that date. The court of claims found the averments in the bill to be true, and found that the 3d article of the treaty of 1866 remained unaffected by any and all laws subsequently thereto enacted by the said Indian nations or by Congress independently of the agreement of March 21, 1902, and confirmed by act of Congress of July 1, 1902; that the Chickasaw Nation had not conferred the rights upon their freedmen as provided in said treaty, or given to them 40 acres of land as provided. And further found that none of the said freedmen elected to remove or were willing to remove from said nation, but they did and now do remain therein; that the United States only agreed to remove them if they were willing to be removed. And further, the freedmen, by not electing to remove from the nation, and remaining therein, forfeited all benefit to the money mentioned in the treaty, 'became in said nation upon the same footing as other citizens of the United States in said nation, and were entitled only to the rights and privileges of such citizens, and were not entitled to the 40 acres of land mentioned and described' in said treaty. It was therefore \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n adjudged that, independently of said agreement, the relations of the freedmen to said nation were only those 'of citizens of the United States residing in the said nation,' and that the said freedmen, independently of said agreement and the aforesaid act of 1902, 'have no rights in the lands of the Chickasaw Nation, nor are they, or any of them, under said article, entitled to allotments in the lands of the said Chickasaw Nation.' The decree concluded as follows:\n'And it is further ordered that, upon the coming in of the roll and appraisal to be made by the Dawes Commission, as referred to in the said statute, the defendants, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, have leave to apply for an additional decree to be entered at the foot of this decree, determining the amount which shall be paid and allowed by the United States to the said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, as directed by said statute; and that the complainant, the United States, be at the same time heard in regard to such amount for which judgment shall be rendered against the United States.'\n\n Mr. Charles W. Needham for the Chickasaw freedmen.\n Messrs. George A. Mansfield, A. A. Hoehling, Jr., and Messrs. Mansfield, McMurray, & Cornish for the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Full quotations have necessarily been made from the statutes and agreements relied on and from the treaty of 1866, but the questions presented are, nevertheless, not complex.\n The main, if not crucial, question is, Were the freedmen adopted by the Chickasaw Nation as provided in the treaty? They were declared adopted by the act of 1873 upon certain conditions, but the act was only to have force and effect 'from and after the approval by the proper authority of the United States.' The United States did not approve until 1894. In the meantime, as early as 1876, the Chickasaws passed an act \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n by which it was 'declared to be the unanimous consent of the Chickasaw legislature' that the United States exercise the right given to it for the benefit of the freedmen by the treaty of 1866. Against the effect of this act several contentions are presented.\n It is urged that the negroes became free by the emancipation proclamation and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and acquired thereby all the rights of freedmen. That may be granted, but what is its consequence? Certainly not to invest the freedmen with any rights in the property, or to participate in the affairs, of their former owners. For such rights we must look to the treaty and subsequent legislation and, to a certain extent, to the act which gave jurisdiction of this suit to the court of claims. We get no aid from the emancipation proclamation or the 13th Amendment. Prominent, of course, in the inquiry is the act of adoption passed by the Chickasaw legislature in 1873. It responded, in the main, to the treaty of 1866, and if it had force in 1894, when it was approved by Congress, the adoption of the freedmen was made complete. Appellants so contend. They say the act of adoption 'was complete in itself and a full exercise of the power possessed by that (Chickasaw) legislature.' And, further, if the act were subject to repeal, it was not repealed. The act, it is contended, expressed a wish only, and not a purpose, and left to the United States to 'follow either of two courses.' Counsel say: 'It (the United States) could approve the act of adoption of 1873, but it could refuse to approve that act, and remove the freedmen as requested by the act of 1876. The power of determining which course should be adopted rested wholly and exclusively with the United States.' The argument is plausible, but we cannot assent to it. Besides, the act of 1876 does not stand alone. In 1885-nine years before Congress acted-another act was passed. Its terms were unmistakable. Its declaration was 'that the Chickasaw people hereby refuse to accept or adopt the freedmen as citizens of the Cherokee Nation upon any terms or conditions whatever.' The governor was requested to notify the department at Washington \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n of the action of the legislature, and was also directed to appoint two competent men to visit Washington and to memorialize Congress 'to provide the means of the removal of the freedmen from the Chickasaw Nation to the country known as Oklahoma in the Indian Territory.' These two acts must be construed to work a repeal of the act of adoption if it could be repealed by the Chickasaw Nation. The latter is denied, and we are brought to the last contention of appellants in regard to the question of adoption. The contention is that 'Congress by the act approved August 15, 1894, gave life and vitality to the Chickasaw act of January 10, 1873;' that is, as we understand the contention, by mere power, and disregarding whatever of convention there was in the treaty of 1866, and whatever of volition was given to the Indians, the United States peremptorily determined the rights of the freedmen in the lands and affairs of the Indians. Granting, without deciding, that Congress possessed such power, we are forced to believe its exercise, if intended, would have been explicit and direct, not left to be inferred by the approval of the act of 1873. That approval is, of course, an element in the controversy, but to give it the effect which appellants do is to make it practically the sole element, and reduces the case to the inquiry what Congress had willed, not what Congress had agreed to. The act of 1902 certainly contemplated and provided for a different inquiry, one that depended upon the agreements of the United States, not upon its power. And this view is supported by the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, expressed August 9, 1898, and which was presumably known to Congress when it passed the act of 1902. The opinion reviewed the treaty of 1866 and subsequent legislation and interpreted  18 of the act of 1894, which approved the act of adoption of 1873, as follows:\n'The language of this provision is not such as would be appropriate to the enactment of original legislation, such as an adoption of the freedmen into the Chickasaw tribe by Congressional enactment, against the consent of the tribe. The terms employed harmonize better with a purpose to merely assent to, or sanction, an act of the tribal legislature supposed \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 126]\n\u00a0\n to be awaiting assent, or sanction, by Congress. The words used are those of approval and acquiescence, and not those of creation or command.'\n\n The conclusion was deduced 'that the Chickasaw freedmen are not members of that tribe, within the meaning of the provision of the agreement submitting the amended agreement to a vote of the male members of the tribe qualified to vote under tribal laws.'\n It follows from these views that the freedmen were not adopted into the Chickasaw tribe, and necessarily did not acquire the rights dependent upon adoption. They make, however, a specific claim to be beneficiaries of the $300,000.\n By the treaty, as we have seen, the United States was to hold that sum in trust for the Indians, to be paid to them upon their conferring certain rights upon the freedmen, and by giving the latter 40 acres of land. If such rights were not conferred within two years from the ratification of the treaty the said sum should then be held in trust for said freedmen, and be held and used by the United States for the benefit of such freedmen as should remove from the territory; and the United States agreed to remove, within ninety days from the expiration of said two years, all such freedmen who should be willing to remove; those who remained or who should return after having been removed, to have no benefit of said sum or any part thereof, but should be upon the same footing as other citizens of the United States.\n The treaty is clear. The Indian nations were to receive the $300,000 if they conferred upon the freedmen the rights expressed in the treaty. Failing to confer those rights, that sum was to be held in trust for all such freedmen, and only such freedmen, as should remove from the territory. The treaty was not complied with either by the Indians or the United States. No rights were conferred upon the freedmen; no freedmen were removed, and the statutes were enacted and the agreements were made that we have described. But those statutes and agreements gave no rights to the freedmen. The only explicit provision for the freedmen was the allotment of 40 acres of land to each of them. They claim to be \n\n[193 U.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n beneficiaries of the $300,000, but the disposition of that under the treaty was to be in the United States, and only to be used for freedmen who should remove from the territory. None have removed. There is an intimation in the brief of their counsel that in their memorials to Congress they expressed a willingness to remove, but Congress did not choose, and has not chosen, to remove them; indeed, has provided for the exact opposite,-provided for the allotment of homes to them out of the lands of the Indians, and for payment to the Indians therefor if it should be determined, in this suit, that the freedmen were not, independently of that agreement, 'entitled to allotments in Choctaw and Chickasaw lands.'\n As we hold the freedmen were not so entitled, the decree of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. COM. TITLE INSURANCE & TRUST CO(1904)\nNo. 172\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. George Hines Gorman for appellant. \n\n[193 U.S. 651, 652]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William R. Andrews for appellee.\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 651, 653]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question involved in this case is whether a mortgagee \n\n[193 U.S. 651, 654]\n\u00a0\n who has foreclosed his mortgage and purchased the property mortgaged at sheriff's sale under a decree of the court is an assignee of the owner of the land within  2 of an act of Congress approved June 16, 1880. 21 Stat. at L. 287, chap. 244, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1415\n\n\n The section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 2. In all cases where homestead or timber-culture or desert- land entries or other entries of public lands have heretofore or shall hereafter be canceled for conflict, or where, from any cause, the entry has been erroneously allowed and cannot be confirmed, the Secretary of the Interior shall cause to be repaid to the person who made such entry, or to his heirs or assigns, the fees and commissions, amount of purchase money and excesses paid upon the same, upon the surrender of the duplicate receipt and the execution of a proper relinquishment of all claims to said land, whenever such entry shall have been duly canceled by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and in all cases where parties have paid double minimum price for land which has afterwards been found not to be within the limits of a railroad land grant, the excess of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre shall in like manner be repaid to the purchaser thereof or to his heirs or assigns.'\n\n It is provided by the rules of the General Land Office that application for repayment under this section shall be accompanied by a duly executed deed, where the title has become a matter of record, relinquishing to the United States all right and claim to the land under the entry or patent.\n The case is this: In 1888 one Amanda Cormack made settlement upon 160 acres of land in the Helena land district of Montana, and paid $200, being at the rate of $1.25 per acre. Subsequently, May 10, 1890, she borrowed from the Northwest Guarantee Loan Company $300, and gave her note therefor, due in three years, and secured the note by a mortgage on the land. On January 9, 1890, the said company assigned the note and mortgage to the Commonwealth Title Insurance Company, the appellee. The instruments were all duly recorded. \n\n[193 U.S. 651, 655]\n\u00a0\n July 8, 1890, the General Land Office informed the local office that 120 acres of the land entered had been recommended and selected for reservoir purposes, and on August 16, 1894, the Commissioner of the General Land Office canceled all of the land entered except the N. W. 1\/4 of the N. E. 1\/4 of section 28, as being in conflict with the Box Elder Reservation system. Subsequently appellee brought suit to foreclose said mortgage, and such proceedings were had therein that on August 16, 1897, the mortgaged property was duly sold to appellee for $200, and a sheriff's deed duly executed and delivered to appellee.\n Thereafter appellee applied to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for the repayment to him of the sum of $150, being $1.25 per acre paid by Amanda Cormack for the 120 acres canceled. The application was refused by the Commissioner. The Secretary of the Interior reversed the ruling and allowed the repayment upon the relinquishment by appellee of all claim to the land so canceled. The relinquishment was duly made and the claim was transmitted to the Treasury Department for final settlement. $ 150, 37 Ct. Cl. 533. the Interior Department passed the claim, but the decision was reversed, and the claim was finally disallowed by the Comptroller.\n The court of claims rendered judgment for appellee for the amount claimed, to wit, $150. 37 Ct. Cl. 533.\n Section 2 of the act of 1880 was considered by this court in Hoffeld v. United States, \n186 U.S. 273\n, 46 L. ed. 1160, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 927. We there distinguished between a voluntary assignment and one created by operation of law. The former 'takes the property,' it was observed, 'with all the rights thereto possessed by his assignor, and if he has paid a valuable consideration, may claim all the rights of a bona fide purchaser with respect thereto.'\n Is a mortgagee within the principle? A brief definition of a mortgage under modern law is not easy to make. At common law a mortgage was a conditional conveyance to secure the payment of money or the performance of some act, to be void upon such payment or performance. By more modern law and \n\n[193 U.S. 651, 656]\n\u00a0\n under the statutes of many states a mortgage is a mere lien upon land. Its dominant attribute is security, but nevertheless it must be regarded as 'both a lien in equity and a conveyance at law.' Pom. Eq. Jur.  1191. The interest of a mortgagee in the land is, therefore, conveyed to him by the mortgagor, and even if, under the laws of Montana, a mortgage is primarily security for a debt, and creates a lien only, it is a lien which may become the title. The decree of the court conveying the title is, of course, the act of the law, but it is the act of the law consummating the act of the mortgagor. And the sale and deed relate to the date of the mortgage, conveying the title which was then possessed by the mortgagor. And for the purpose of this case we need go no farther in elaboration of the legal attributes of a mortgage. We regard the word 'assigns,' as used in the statute, as one who derives from the original entryman by the voluntary act of the latter. We regard also the right conferred by the statute as attaching to the land,-a kind of warranty upon the part of the United States to restore the consideration paid for the land if the contingencies expressed in the statute occur.\n It is insisted, however, that all of the conditions of the repayment have not been complied with; that there has not been a surrender of the duplicate receipt, as provided by the statute. Hoffeld v. United States, \n186 U.S. 273\n, 46 L. ed. 1160, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 927. There is certainly no direct finding to that effect. There is a finding, however, that the Secretary of the Interior ordered repayment 'on the relinquishment by the claimants of all claim to the land so canceled,' and a further finding that the relinquishment was made 'as required by the rules and regulations of the Land Office.'\n We must presume that the Secretary did his duty and exacted the performance of all the statute required, and infer, therefore, that he had received the duplicate receipt, and all that was necessary to fulfil the conditions of the statute and revest the title in the United States to the land canceled.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

In each case the accounts for services had been duly approved by the circuit or district court; certain items had been disallowed by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department; thereupon these suits were brought; and the court of claims made findings of fact and conclusions of law. In view of the action of the two courts and of our previous decisions, the points raised in argument do not seem to require particular discussion.\n In No. 197 the judgment of the court of claims included, among other items, this: 'Administering oaths and affixing jurats to accounts of United States marshals, at 10 cents for each oath and 15 cents for each jurat, $91.20.'\n By the act of February 22, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 333, chap. 95, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 648), clerks, marshals, and district attorneys are required to render their accounts, duly sworn to, for approval. We agree with counsel for the government that the making of the oath and attaching the same to the account is a part of the formality of presenting \n\n[193 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n such accounts, without which they are not properly rendered. This item, therefore, should not have been allowed against the United States in favor of the clerk. United States v. Van Duzee, \n140 U.S. 169\n, 35 L. ed. 399, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758; United States v. Jones, \n147 U.S. 672\n, 37 L. ed. 325, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437; United States v. Allred, \n155 U.S. 591\n, 39 L. ed. 273, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231.\n The judgment of the court of claims will be modified by the omission of this item, and, as so modified, affirmed.\n In No. 198, the government objects to the allowance of certain charges for transcript of record on writ of error in criminal proceedings, by order of court, on behalf of an indigent defendant; for services in connection with affidavits of poverty; and for issuing subpoenas for grand and petit jurors. As to the transcript, the contention is that  878 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 668), providing for payment under order of court of fees and costs when defendant under indictment is without means, is exclusive, and does not cover the charge for this service. Here, again, we think the question has been settled, in effect, by what was said in United States v. Barber, \n140 U.S. 164\n, 35 L. ed. 396, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 749; United States v. Van Duzee, \n140 U.S. 169\n, 35 L. ed. 399, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758; and United States v. Allred, 39 L. ed. 273, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231. It was held that an order of the court requiring a service to be performed was sufficient authority as between the clerk and the government for the performance of the service and the allowance of the proper fee therefor.\n Section 878 was originally enacted in 1846, and should not be held to operate as a prohibition to the extent contended. The indigent defendant ought not to be deprived of availing himself of his writ of error because of his poverty, and, when the court has ordered the transcript in the interest of justice, the clerk ought not to be deprived of compensation.\n The same considerations dispose of the objection to the second item as to affidavits of defendants in criminal cases of inability to pay costs. And we agree with the court of claims in sustaining the charges for issuing subpoenas for grand and petit jurors by order of court, the charge for seals being rejected. The subject is well treated in Martin v. United States, 26 Ct. Cl. 160. The judgment will be affirmed. \n\n[193 U.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n In No. 199 counsel for United States assign error in the allowance of charges (1) for administering oaths, by order of court, to witnesses for defendants on trial in criminal cases; (2) for administering oaths to affidavits of poverty, and affixing jurats; (3) for filing and entering applications for process; (4) for filing and entering motions of indigent defendants for new trial; (5) and for services rendered an indigent defendant, by order of court, in prosecution of a writ of error in a capital case. We assume that all these items relate to indigent defendants, and considering  828 and 878 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 635, 668), the act of February 6, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 655, chap. 113),1 our previous decisions, and what has just been said, we perceive no reason for declining to accept the conclusions of the court of claims.\n No. 525 is a cross appeal from the judgment brought up in No. 199. We hold that the cross appeal lies in the circumstances, but agree with the disallowance by the court of claims of the items involved. Two of these items consisted of charges for certificates to copies of sci. fa., and to copies of orders of court for furnishing meals to jurors. No direction of court as to such certificates was shown. The other item was for administering oaths on the voir dire of grand and petit jurors and we do not think can be justified under the fourth clause of  828. The judgment will be affirmed.\n Judgments will be entered as above indicated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp.

MARTINEZ(1904)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n This action was brought in the court of claims on October 24, 1891, to recover damages against the United States and the Utetribe of Indians, in the sum of $1,400, the value of certain sheep alleged to have been taken and destroyed or used in June, 1873, by the said Indians. The petition was filed under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1891, entitled \"An act to Provide for the Adjudication and Payment of Claims Arising from Indian Depredations.\" 26 Stat. at L. 851, chap. 538 U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 758. On February 5, 1902, the Assistant Attorney General of the United States answered the allegations of the peti- \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n tion by a general denial. On November 4, 1902, the claimant filed a motion for leave to file an amended petition, charging the depredation to have been committed by the Kiowa Indians, which motion was allowed, and upon the same day the amended petition was filed. On November 5, 1902, the Assistant Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the United States and the Kiowa Indians, filed a plea to the amended petition, setting up that no action had been commenced against the Kiowa Indians within three years after the passage of the act of March 3, 1891. On November 11, 1902, this plea in bar was overruled, and, upon the general issue being pleaded and trial had, the court found as a matter of fact: At the time of the depredation the claimant's decedent was a citizen of the United States. In June, 1873, in Mora county, New Mexico, Indians belonging to the Kiowa tribe took and drove away property of the kind and character described in the petition, the property of claimant's decedent, which was reasonably worth the sum of $690. At the time of said depredation defendant Indians were in amity with the United States.\n As a conclusion of law, the majority of the court decided that the claimant recover a judgment against the United States and the Kiowa Indians, in the sum of $690.\n The defendants appealed to this court.\n Mr. Lincoln B. Smith, by special leave, and Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellants.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William H. Robeson for appellee.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This claim arises under the Indian depredation act of March 3, 1891 ( 26 Stat. at L. 851, chap. 538, U. S.Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 758), and presents the question whether, after the expiration of three years from the filing of the petition in the court of claims, a tribe of Indians not originally named in the petition can be brought into the action by amended petition, with a view to proceeding against such tribe to judgment. The record discloses that the original petition was filed on October 24, 1891; the amended petition on November 4, 1902. The Attorney General filed a plea setting up the bar of the statute, which plea was overruled, and thereafter, upon issue joined and testimony taken, judgment was rendered against the tribe of Indians so brought in by the amended petition.\n The act in question was before this court in United States v. Gorham, \n165 U.S. 316\n, 41 L. ed. 729, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 382, and in that case it was held that, where the Indian tribe cannot be identified, a judgment for the amount of the claim can be rendered against the United States. In the opinion of the court in that case, the act was analyzed and its various sections construed; and it only remains to consider so much of the act and its purposes as will lead to a solution of the question now under consideration.\n The provisions of the 1st section of the act are positive,-that all claims existing at the time of the taking effect of the act shall be presented to the court by petition, as therein \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n provided, within three years after the passage of the act, or be forever barred. This section, by itself considered, would seem to conclude the right of the petitioner to bring in a new party to the preceeding after the expiration of three years, in such wise as to preclude the right to rely upon the bar of the statute. For obvious reasons, a party brought into court by an amendment, and who has, for the first time, an opportunity to make defense to the action, has a right to treat the proceeding, as to him, as commenced by the process which brings him into court. Miller v. M'Intyre, 6 Pet. 61, 8 L. ed. 320. Conceding this proposition as applied to ordinary actions, it is urged that this proceeding is so peculiar in character as to take it out of the general rule. Section 3 of the act provides:\n\"That all claims shall be presented to the court by petition, setting forth in ordinary and concise language, without unnecessary repetition, the facts upon which such claims are based, the persons, classes of persons, tribe or tribes or band of Indians by whom the alleged illegal acts were committed, as near as may be, the property lost or destroyed and the value thereof, and any other facts connected with the transactions, and material to the proper adjudication of the case involved.\"\n\n The 5th section of the statute provides:\n\"That the court shall determine, in each case, the value of the property taken or destroyed at the time and place of the loss or destruction, and, if possible, the tribe of Indians or other persons by whom the wrong was committed, and shall render judgment in favor of the claimant or claimants against the United States, and against the tribe of Indians committing the wrong, when such can be identified.\"\n\n Section 4 provides for service upon the Attorney General, whose duty it is to appear and defend for both the interests of the government and the Indians, and giving to any Indian or Indians interested in the proceedings the right to appear and defend by an attorney employed with the approval of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. By the 6th section the \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n amount of the judgment is charged against the tribe by which or the members of which the depredation was committed; and if no annuity, fund, or appropriation is available as provided, the judgment is to be paid from the treasury of the United States, to remain a charge against the tribe, and to be deducted from any annuity, fund, or appropriation thereafter due from the United States to such tribe. It is contended that, inasmuch as the Indian tribes are not necessary parties to the proceeding, and are not required to be served with process except so far as the notice to the Attorney General is such service, and are only to be described \"as near as may be,\" they may be brought in at any time before judgment, whenever such tribe \"can be identified,\" as set forth in the 5th section of the act. The reasons for this conclusion are fully set forth in the opinion of the court of claims in Duran v. United States, 31 Ct. Cl. 353. But we are unable to concur in the conclusions therein reached. In our view, the act provides for a recovery of depredation claims in two classes of cases: the one where the persons, classes of persons, tribe or tribes or band of Indians cannot be identified, in which event the United States may be held liable, upon proof complying with other terms of the act, though failing to identify the particular depredators; the other, where the persons or tribe described in the act can be identified, in which event they must be named in the petition, and the judgment will go against the United States and the tribe committing the wrong, to be satisfied primarily out of the funds of the Indians. As was said in the Gorham Case, \n165 U.S. 321\n, 41 L. ed. 731, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384: \"It may be fairly claimed that, reading all the provisions together, the act makes it necessary, when known, to join with the United States the Indians or tribe of Indians by whom the illegal acts are alleged or are supposed to have been committed.'\n Whichever form the action takes, it must be brought within three years after the passage of the act, as provided by the 1st section. In requiring the band or tribe of Indians to be described as near as may be, it is the purpose of the act to \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n require such tribe, primarily liable for the injury, to be brought before the court, when they can be identified, for the purpose of the judgment authorized in the 5th section. All the sections are to be read together to effectuate the purpose of the law; and when the tribe \"can be identified,\" it must be described as near as may be; that is, with reasonable accuracy, sufficiently identifying the party for the purposes of the action and judgment, resorting to the liability of the United States alone only in cases where the offending parties cannot be identified. The claimant, under the statute, has three years for the purpose of investigating his cause of action, and, in cases where it can be done, identifying the tribe sufficiently for the purposes of plcading and judgment against both the United States and the Indian tribe, or, in the alternative, proceeding against the United States alone. It is true that the act does not, in terms, provide for service upon the Indian tribes, their agents or attorneys, and the Attorney General is required to appear for them as well as for the United States. Of this provision, Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court in the Gorham Case, \n165 U.S. 321\n, 41 L. ed. 731, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384, said: \"Although the 4th section provides for the defense of the claim by the law officer of the government, under any circumstances, yet, as the interest of the Indians is embraced in the inquiry before the court because of their liability to a judgment against them if identified, and to a payment of that judgment out of the annuities or otherwise, as provided for in the 6th section, it is proper to allow them to appear, and defend also by their own attorney.\" When brought into court they may give, by special counsel, more careful attention to their particular defense than could be given by the law officer of the government charged with the defense of thousands of similar claims. But it is said that the Attorney General, by failing to promptly raise, by plea, the defense of misjoinder, is quite as much in fault as the petitioner, in permitting more than three years to elapse before the new party is brought in; and it is said that, at the common law, this objection could only be raised by such plea season- \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n ably interposed. At common law, where it was sought to bring in another party jointly liable, a plea by the defendant, setting forth the nonjoinder, and giving the name of such party, was the proper method of procedure. 3 Chitty, Pl. \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 901]\n\u00a0\n and notes. But such is not the present case. The original petition charged positively that the depredation was committed by the Ute Indians. It was sufficient for the Attorney General to plead the general issue to put the plaintiff upon proof of his allegations. It is said that eleven thousand of these cases have been begun; and it is not to be presumed that the Attorney General would know the facts of each case, and be in possession of information to fulfil the requisite of a good plea, and furnish the name of the party to be impleaded. It was for the plaintiff to make such investigation as would warrant the beginning of the action against the proper tribe, or against the United States alone, averring that the particular tribe could not be identified.\n It is further insisted that it is the purpose of the act, as provided for in the 5th section, to require the judgment to be rendered against the Indian tribe, if it can be identified, at any time before judgment, and that this construction is required to protect the interests of the United States. But we think this section should be read in connection with the other sections of the act, and the manifest purpose is to join in the petition, when it can be identified, the tribe by whom the depredation was committed, and to limit the presentation of the claim to three years from the passage of the act. If this be not so, the Indians may be made parties to the proceeding and judgment without being brought into court in any manner until years after the alleged wrong was committed, and when it may be impossible, by reason of the lapse of time, or the death or disappearance of witnesses, to make adequate defence. The construction herein put upon the statute will give to the three years' limitation the effect of other statutes of limitation, and will, in our judgment, best effectuate the purpose of the act. This act is extremely liberal in permitting \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n presentation of claims for Indian depredations. All limitations are swept away except the requirement as to the time of filing the petition. In the present case the depredation is alleged to have been committed eighteen years before the action was commenced. Under these liberal provisions we think it was the purpose of the law to require parties to be duly prosecuted within the three years allowed for the filing of petitions; and the liberality of the act should not be extended by construction. As the case was prosecuted against the wrong tribe until after the three years had expired, it cannot be maintained against the Indians sought to be brought in by the amendment, nor can it be sustained against the United States, which is liable by itself only in cases where the depredating Indians or other persons are unknown.\n It follows that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed and the petition directed to be dismissed, and it is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concurs Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n Under the Indian depredation act of March 3, 1891, the United States was sued by one Gorman, in the court of claims, and it was averred in the petition that the damage complained of had been inflicted by the Comanche and Kiowa tribes of Indians, who were in amity with the United States. After hearing, the court of claims, finding it to be established by the proof that the loss complained of had been occasioned by Indians in amity with the United States, but that the proof did not show that the Comanche and Kiowa tribes were the wrongdoers, nevertheless, without any amendment of the petition, rendered a judgment solely against the United States. The action of the court of claims was sustained by this court in United States v. Gorham, \n165 U.S. 316\n, 41 L. ed. 729, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 328.\n In considering the power conferred by the statute it was said (p. 320, L. ed. p. 731, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 384): \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n \"In conferring jurisdiction in this class of cases upon the court of claims, it will be seen that Congress conferred it in regard to all claims for property of citizens of the United States, taken or destroyed by Indians belonging to any band, tribe, or nation in amity with the United States, without just cause or provocation on the part of the owner or agent in charge. So long as the depredations were committed upon the property of citizens of the United States, and by Indians in amity with the government, without just cause, etc., jurisdiction and authority to inquire into and finally adjudicate upon such claims was granted to the court. This broad ground of jurisdiction would, unless circumscribed by the subsequent provision of the act, permit an adjudication against the United States alone. There is nothing in any other portion of the act which provides, in terms, for joining, as codefendants with the United States, the tribes or bands of Indians by whom the alleged illegal acts were committed. The 3d section of the act merely provides for the contents of the petition; and by such section it is made the duty of the petitioner to state in his petition 'the persons, classes of persons, tribe or tribes or band or Indians by whom the alleged illegal acts were committed, as near as may be,' etc. This is for the obvious purpose of giving some notice to the government of the alleged facts upon which the claim is based, so that the proper defense, if any exist, may be made to the claim.\"\n Again, after pointing out that the statute made it \"the duty of the court to determine in each case, if possible, the tribe of Indians of other persons by whom the wrong was committed, and to render judgment in favor of the claimant or claimants against the United States, and against the tribe of Indians committing the wrong when such can be identified,\" it was observed (p. 321, L. ed. p. 731, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 384):\n\"But the 5th section provides for judgment in favor of claimant, and against the United States, in any event where the property of a citizen has been destroyed under the circumstances provided in the statute, but only against the tribe \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 479]\n\u00a0\n of Indians committing the wrong 'when such can be identified;' and of course it follows that, if they cannot be identified, no judgment can go against them. The United States would then be left as alone responsible for the property destroyed, provided the proofs were of the character mentioned in the 1st section of the act; that is, the claimant would be bound to prove that he was a citizen of the United States at the time of the taking or destruction of his property; that it had been taken by Indians belonging to some band or tribe or nation in amity with the United States, without just cause or provocation on the part of the owner or agent in charge; and that it had not been returned or paid for.\"\n\n To my mind this decision clearly establishes that, under the act of Congress, the Indian tribe by whom the depredation was committed was not an essential party to give the court jurisdiction over the claim. This conclusion, it seems to me, is inevitable from the ruling that, although it was alleged in the petition that a particular tribe was the wrongdoer, it was competent for the court to conform to the proof, and render a judgment against the United States, in a case where the proof did not establish the truth of the averment as to the tribe committing the injury, if only it was shown that the wrong complained of must have been committed by some Indian tribe which was in amity with the United States. Now, the question on this record is simply whether a petitioner who has alleged that the wrong was committed by a particular tribe can, after the three years' limitation, amend by stating another and different tribe as the wrongdoer. It is decided that such amendment cannot be allowed, because to allow it would amount to a fatal departure; that is, the substitution of a new and wholly different cause of action.\n Consistently with the ruling previously made, my mind cannot assent to this conclusion. To adopt it without specifically overruling the Gorham Case, it seems to me, is to declare, on the one hand, that it is not essential to prove the allegation that the wrong was committed by a particular tribe, and, on \n\n[195 U.S. 469, 480]\n\u00a0\n the other hand, to say that the allegation as to the tribe committing the wrong was essential to the cause of action. That is to declare that a particular allegation is, at the same time, both essential and nonessential,-essential to be alleged, but not essential to be proved.\n As it is considered by me that the Gorham Case is conclusive of this, and as the opinion now announced does not purport to overrule that case, it is not necessary for me to enter into a statement of my reasons for believing that, even if that case did not exist, the construction now given to the statute is not only repugnant to its text, but conflicts both with the rights of individual claimants and those of the United States, as shown by the purpose and spirit of the act.\n I therefore dissent. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. SING TUCK(1904)\nNo. 591\nArgued: April 7, 1904Decided: April 25, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert M. Moore and W. W. Cantwell for respondents.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of habeas corpus against a Chinese inspector and inspector of immigration. It appears from his return that the Chinese persons concerned came from China by way of Canada, and were seeking admission into the United States. On examination by an inspector five gave their names, stated that they were born in the United States (United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 U.S. 649\n, 42 L. ed. 890, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456 ), and answered no further questions. The rest gave their names and then stood mute, not even alleging citizenship. The inspector decided against their right to enter the country, and informed them of their right to appeal to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. No appeal was taken, and while they were detained at a properly designated detention house for return to China, a petition was filed by a lawyer purporting to act on their behalf, alleging that they all were citizens of the United States, and this writ was obtained. In the circuit court the detention was adjudged to be lawful, and the writ was dismissed without a trial on the merits. This decision was reversed by the circuit court of appeals on the ground that the parties concerned were entitled to a judicial investigation of their status.\n By the act of August 18, 1894, 28 Stat. at L. 390, chap. 301 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1303), 'In every case where an alien is excluded from admission into the United States under any law or treaty now existing or hereafter made, the decision of the appropriate immigration or customs officers, if adverse to the admission of such alien, shall be final, unless \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n reversed on appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury.' The jurisdiction of the Treasury Department was transferred to the Department of Commerce and Labor by the act of February 14, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 825, chap. 552). It was held by the circuit court of appeals that the act of 1894 should not be construed to submit the right of a native-born citizen of the United States to return hither to the final determination of executive officers, and the conclusion was assumed to follow that these cases should have been tried on their merits. Before us it was argued that, by the construction of the statute, the fact of citizenship went to the jurisdiction of the immigration officers (see Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 U.S. 1\n, 7, ante, p. 177, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177; Miller v. Horton, 152 Mass. 540, 548, 10 L. R. A. 116, 23 Am. St. Rep. 850, 26 N. E. 100), and therefore that the statute did not purport to apply to one who was a citizen in fact. We are of opinion, however, that the words quoted apply to a decision on the question of citizenship, and that, even if it be true that the statute could not make that decision final, the consequence drawn by the circuit court of appeals does not follow, and is not correct.\n We shall not argue the meaning of the words of the act. That must be taken to be established. Lem Moon Sing v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 538, 546\n, 547 S., 39 L. ed. 1082, 1085, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967. As to whether or not the act could make the decision of an executive officer final upon the fact of citizenship, we leave the question where we find it. The Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 97\n, 47 S. L. ed. 721, 724, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; Fok Young Yo v. United States, \n185 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 305 S., 46 L. ed. 917, 921, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686. See Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1121, 1126, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. Whatever may be the law on that point, the decisions just cited are enough to show that it is too late to contend that the act of 1894 is void as a whole. But if the act is valid, even if ineffectual on this single point, then it points out a mode of procedure which must be followed before there can be a resort to the courts. In order to act at all the executive officer must decide upon the question of citizenship. If his jurisdiction is subject to being upset, still it is necessary that he should proceed if he decides that it exists. An appeal is provided by the \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n statute. The first mode of attacking his decision is by taking that appeal. If the appeal fails, it then is time enough to consider whether, upon a petition showing reasonable cause, there ought to be a further trial upon habeas corpus.\n We perfectly appreciate, while we neither countenance nor discountenance, the argument drawn from the alleged want of jurisdiction. But while the consequence of that argument, if sound, is that both executive officers and Secretary of Commerce and Labor are acting without authority, it is one of the necessities of the administration of justice that even fundamental questions should be determined in an orderly way. If the allegations of a petition for habeas corpus setting up want of jurisdiction, whether of an executive officer or of an ordinary court, are true, the petitioner theoretically is entitled to his liberty at once. Yet a summary interruption of the regular order of proceedings, by means of the writ, is not always a matter of right. A familiar illustration is that of a person imprisoned upon criminal process by a state court, under a state law alleged to be unconstitutional. If the law is unconstitutional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, except under exceptional circumstances, the courts of the United States do not interfere by habeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first place, take his case to the highest court of the state to which he can go, and after that he generally is left to the remedy by writ of error if he wishes to bring the case here. Minnesota v. Brundage, \n180 U.S. 499\n, 45 L. ed. 639, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455; Baker v. Grice, \n169 U.S. 284\n, 42 L. ed. 748, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 323. In Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 U.S. 1\n, ante, p. 177, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177, there was no use in delaying the issue of the writ until an appeal had been taken, because in that case therewas no dispute about the facts, but merely a question of law. Here the issue, if there is one, is pure matter of fact,-a claim of citizenship under circumstances and in a form naturally raising a suspicion of fraud.\n Considerations similar to those which we have suggested lead to a further conclusion. Whatever may be the ultimate rights of a person seeking to enter the country, and alleging that he is a citizen, it is within the power of Congress to provide, at \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n least, for a preliminary investigation by an inspector, and for a detention of the person until he has established his citizenship in some reasonable way. If the person satisfies the inspector, he is allowed to enter the country without further trial. Now, when these Chinese, having that opportunity, saw fit to refuse it, we think an additional reason was given for not allowing a habeas corpus at that stage. The detention during the time necessary for investigation was not unlawful, even if all these parties were citizens of the United States, and were not attempting to upset the inspection machinery by a transparent device. Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 228, 235\n, 41 S. L. ed. 140, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 977. They were offered a way to prove their alleged citizenship and to be set at large, which would be sufficient for most people who had a case, and which would relieve the courts. If they saw fit to refuse that way, they properly were held down strictly to their technical rights.\n But it is said that if, under any circumstances, the question of citizenship could be left to the final decision of an executive officer, the Chinese regulations made under the statutes by the Department of Commerce and Labor are such that they do not allow a citizen due process of law, and the same argument is urged in favor of the right to decline to take any part in such proceedings from the outset. The rules objected to require the officer to prevent communication with the parties other than by officials under his control, and to have them examined promptly touching their right to admission. The examination is to be apart from the public, in the presence of the government officials and such witnesses only as the examining officer shall designate. This last is the provision especially stigmatized. It is said that the parties are allowed to produce only such witnesses as are designated by the officer. But that is a plain perversion of the meaning of the words. If the witnesses referred to are not merely witnesses to the examination, if they are witnesses in the cause, still the provision only excludes such witnesses at the discretion of the officer pending the examination of the party concerned,-a natural precaution in this class \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n of cases, the reasonableness of which does not need to be explained. It is common in ordinary trials. No right is given to the officer to exercise any control or choice as to the witnesses to be heard, and no such choice was attempted in fact. On the contrary, the parties were told that if they could produce two witnesses who knew that they had the right to enter, their testimony would be taken and carefully considered; and various other attempts were made to induce the suggestion of any evidence or help to establish the parties' case, but they stood mute. The separate examination is another reasonable precaution, and it is required to take place promptly, to avoid the hardship of a long detention. In case of appeal counsel are permitted to examine the evidence, Rule 7, and it is implied that new evidence, briefs, affidavits, and statements may be submitted, all of which can be forwarded with the appeal. Rule 9. The whole scheme is intended to give as fair a chance to prove a right to enter the country as the necessarily summary character of the proceedings will permit.\n We are of opinion that the attempt to disregard and override the provisions of the statutes and the rules of the Department, and to swamp the courts by a resort to them in the first instance, must fail. We may add that, even if it is beyond the power of Congress to make the decision of the Department final upon the question of citizenship, we agree with the circuit court of appeals that a petition for habeas corpus ought not to be entertained unless the court is satisfied that the petitioner can make out at least a prima facie case. A mere allegation of citizenship is not enough. But, before the courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting process provided by the statutes must be gone through with. Whether after that a further trial may be had we do not decide.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Peckham, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in either the foregoing opinion or \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 171]\n\u00a0\n judgment. I have heretofore dissented in several cases involving the exclusion or expulsion of the Chinese, but, although my views on the questions are unchanged, do not care to repeat anything then said. I pass rather to consider the present case and the declarations of the court. That is, as stated in the opinion, one of persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, denied by an inspector of immigration-a mere ministerial officer-the right to enter the country, and who are now informed by this court that their application to the courts for the enforcement of that right must be denied. They are told that their only remedy is by appeal from one ministerial officer to another.\n The decision is based upon the act of August 18, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 390, chap. 301, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1303), which provides:\n'In every case where an alien is excluded from admission into the United States under any law or treaty now existing or hereafter made, the decision of the appropriate immigration or customs officers, if adverse to the admission of such alien, shall be final, unless reversed on appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury.'\n\n But by its very terms that act applies only to an alien, and these parties assert that they are not aliens. If not aliens, certainly that act is inapplicable. So affirms Rule 2, prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, concerning the immigration of Chinese persons, which reads: 'If the Chinese person has been born in the United States, neither the immigration acts nor the Chinese exclusion acts prohibiting persons of the Chinese race, and especially Chinese laborers, from coming into the United States, apply to such person.' So this court has held at the present term. Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 U.S. 1\n, ante, p. 177, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177, decided January 4, 1904. In that case it appeared that Isabella Gonzales, an unmarried woman, coming from Porto Rico to New York, was prevented from landing, and detained by the immigration commissioner as an alien immigrant. A writ of habeas corpus was issued on her behalf by the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 172]\n\u00a0\n New York. Upon a hearing the writ was dismissed and she remanded to the custody of the commissioner. On appeal to this court that decision was reversed, and it was said in the opinion (p. 7, ante, p. 177, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 177):\n'If she was not an alien immigrant within the intent and meaning of the act of Congress entitled 'An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of Aliens Under Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor,' approved March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 1084, chap. 551, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1294), the commissioner had no power to detain or deport her, and the final order of the circuit court must be reversed.'\n\n There, as here, the applicant had not appealed from the decision of the immigration officer to the Secretary of the Treasury; that fact was pleaded in the return to the writ, and on the argument before us this act of August 18, 1894, was cited by the government, and the argument made that the remedy was by appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury. I quote the language of the Solicitor General as reported (p. 4):\n'The act of August 18, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 390, chap. 301, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1303), makes the decision of the appropriate immigration or customs officer, if adverse to the admission of an alien, final unless reversed on appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury. Even if appellant herein was ultimately entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, she was not in a position justly to obtain the writ until she had prosecuted an unavailing appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury, and thus pursued her remedy in the executive course to the uttermost.'\n\n That case did not hold that the applicant was a citizen of the United States, but only that, being a subject of Porto Rico, an island ceded to the United States, and, as adjudged by a bare majority of this court in conflicting opinions, not within the full scope of constitutional protection, she was not an alien immigrant. Here the petitioners claim that they are citizens by birth, and the dccision is that, nevertheless, they cannot be heard in a court to prove the fact which they allege. There the petition disclosed both a question of law and one of fact, for not until the return to the writ was the question of fact \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 173]\n\u00a0\n eliminated; here, on the face of the petition, only a question of fact is presented, for the law applicable had been fully settled by the decision of this court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 U.S. 649\n, 42 L. ed. 890, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456.\n But it is said that, inasmuch as Congress has provided for an appeal from the immigration officer to the Secretary of the Treasury, or, rather, since the recent act transferring jurisdiction to the Department of Commerce and Labor, to the Secretary of the latter department, the orderly administration of affairs requires that the remedy by appeal to the Secretary should be followed. It was not so held in the Gonzales Case, and I do not appreciate why it should be deemed necessary in the case of one claiming to be a citizen, and not deemed necessary in respect to one who is merely not an alien immigrant. We have called American citizenship an 'inestimable heritage' (Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1121, 1125, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891), and I cannot understand why one who claims it should be denied the earliest possible hearing in the courts upon the truth of his claim.\n Why should any one who claims the right of citizenship be denied prompt access to the courts? If it be an 'inestimable heritage,' can Congress deprive one of the right to a judicial determination of its existence, and ought the courts to unnecessarily avoid or postpone an inquiry thereof? If it be said that the conduct of these petitioners before the inspector was not such as to justify a belief in the probability of their claim of citizenship, it is sufficient answer that they assert the claim and ask a right to be heard. I never supposed that courts could deny a party a hearing on the ground that they did not believe it probable that he could establish the claim which he makes.\n The postponement of the right to judicial inquiry until after the remedy by appeal to the Secretary has been exhausted is justified by analogy to the rule which restrains this court from interfering with the orderly administration of criminal law in the courts of a state until after a final determination by the \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 174]\n\u00a0\n highest court of that state. But there is this essential difference: To the highest court of a state a writ of error runs from this court, and there is, therefore, propriety in waiting until the final decision of the courts of the states, the presumption being always that they will uphold the Constitution of the United States, and enforce any rights granted by it.\n In Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 252 S., 29 L. ed. 868, 871, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734, 740, 741, this court said:\n'Does the statute imperatively require the circuit court, by writ of habeas corpus, to wrest the petitioner from the custody of the state officers in advance of his trial in the state court? We are of opinion that while the circuit court has the power to do so, and may discharge the accused in advance of his trial if he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the national Constitution, it is not bound in every case to exercise such a power immediately upon application being made for the writ. We cannot suppose that Congress intended to compel those courts, by such means, to draw to themselves, in the first instance, the control of all criminal prosecutions commenced in state courts exercising authority within the same territorial limits, where the accused claims that he is held in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The injunction to hear the case summarily, and thereupon 'to dispose of the party as law and justice require,' does not deprive the court of discretion as to the time and mode in which it will exert the powers conferred upon it. That discretion should be exercised in the light of the relations existing, under our system of government, between the judicial tribunals of the Union and of the states, and in recognition of the fact that the public good requires that those relations be not disturbed by unnecessary conflict between courts equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the Constitution. . . . This court holds that where a person is in custody, under process from a state court of original jurisdiction, for an alleged offence against the laws of such state, and it is claimed that he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the circuit court has a discretion, whether it \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 175]\n\u00a0\n will discharge him, upon habeas corpus, in advance of his trial in the court in which he is indicted; that discretion, however, to be subordinate to any special circumstances requiring immediate action. When the state court shall have finally acted upon the case, the circuit court has still a discretion whether, under all the circumstances then existing, the accused, if convicted, shall be put to his writ of error from the highest court of the state, or whether it will proceed, by writ of habeas corpus, summarily to determine whether the petitioner is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n But here there is no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the Secretary to this or to any other court, and the remedy which must be pursued then as now is only that of habeas corpus. Indeed, in the opinion the court does not give to these petitioners encouragement to believe that there can be any judicial examination, even after the decision by the Secretary against their claim of American citizenship. If a judicial hearing at any time is not in terms denied, it is, at least, like a famous case of old, passed to 'a convenient season.' Meantime the American citizen must abide in the house of detention.\n Further, there are special reasons why this prompt judicial inquiry by the writ of habeas corpus should be sustained. On July 27, 1903, the Secreatary of Commerce and Labor, as authorized by statute, promulgated certain regulations concerning the admission of Chinese persons. Rule 4 named a dozen ports at which alone such persons should be permitted to enter, Malone, N. Y., where these petitioners are detained, being one of the number. Rules 6, 7, 8, 9, 21, and 22 are as follows:\n'Rule 6. Immediately upon the arrival of Chinese persons at any port mentioned in Rule 4 it shall be the duty of the officer in charge of the administration of the Chinese exclusion laws to adopt suitable means to prevent communication with them by any persons other than officials under his control, to have said Chinese persons examined promptly, as by law pro- \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 176]\n\u00a0\n vided, touching their right to admission, and to permit those proving such right to land.\n\n'Rule 7. The examination prescribed in Rule 6 should be separate and apart from the public, in the presence of government officials, and such witness or witnesses only as the exaimining officer shall designate, and, if, upon the conclusion thereof, the Chinese applicant for admission is adjudged to be inadmissible, he should be advised of his right of appeal, and his counsel should be permitted, after duly filing notice of appeal, to examine, but not to make copies of, the evidence upon which the excluding decision is based.\n\n'Rule 8. Every Chinese person refused admission under the provisions of the exclusion laws by the decision of the officer in charge at the port of entry must, if he shall elect to take an appeal to the Secretary, give written notice thereof to said officer within two days after such decision is rendered.\n\n'Rule 9. Notice of appeal provided for in Rule 8 shall act as a stay upon the disposal of the Chinese person whose case is thereby affected until a final decision is rendered by the Secretary; and within three days after the filing of such notice, unless further delay is required to investigate and report upon new evidence, the complete record of the case, together with such briefs, affidavits, and statements as are to be considered in connection therewith, shall be forwarded to the Commissioner General of Immigration by the officer in charge at the port of arrival, accompanied by his views thereon in writing; but on such appeal no evidence will be considered that has not been made the subject of investigation and report by the said officer in charge.'\n\n'Rule 21. The burden of proof in all cases rests upon Chinese persons claiming the right of admission to, or residence within, the United States, to establish such right affirmatively and satisfactorily to the appropriate government officers, and in no case in which the law prescribes the nature of the evidence to establish such right shall other evidence be accepted in lieu thereof, and in every doubtful case the benefit of the doubt \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 177]\n\u00a0\n shall be given by administrative officers to the United States government.\n\n'Rule 22. No authenticated copy of a judicial finding that a Chinese person was born in the United States shall be accepted as conclusive in favor of the person presenting it, unless he be completely identified as the person to whom such authenticated copy purports to relate.'\n\n By Rule 6 it is the duty of the inspector to prevent any communication between the immigrant and any person other than his own officials. In other words, no communication with counsel or with friends is permitted. By Rule 7 the examination is to be private, in the presence only of government officials and such witnesses as the examining officer shall designate. The most notorious outlaw in the land, when charged by the United States with crime, is, by constitutional enactment (art. 6, Amendments U. S. Constitution), given compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and the assistance of counsel for his defense; but the Chinaman-although by birth a citizen of the United States-is thus denied counsel and the right of obtaining witnesses. After he has been adjudged inadmissible, then, and then for the first time, is he permitted to have counsel and advised of his right of appeal, and such counsel, after filing notice of appeal, is permitted to examine, but not make copies of, the testimony upon which the excluding order is based. By Rule 8, if he desires to appeal, he must give written notice thereof within two days after the decision. By Rule 9, within three days after the filing of notice a complete record of the case is transmitted to the Commissioner General of Immigration, and on such appeal no evidence will be considered that has not been made the subject of investigation and report by the inspector. Can anything be more harsh and arbitrary? Coming into a port of the United States, as these petitioners did into the port of Malone, placed as they were in a house of detention, shut off from communication with friends and counsel, examined before an inspector with no one to advise or counsel, only such witnesses present as the in- \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 178]\n\u00a0\n spector may designate, and, upon an adverse decision, compelled to give notice of appeal within two days, within three days the transcript forwarded to the Commissioner General, and nothing to be considered by him except the testimony obtained in this Star Chamber proceeding. This is called due process of law to protect the rights of an American citizen, and sufficient to prevent inquiry in the courts.\n But it is said that the applicants did not prove before the immigration officer that they were citizens; that some simply alleged the fact, while others said nothing; that they were told that if they would give the names of two witnesses their testimony would be taken and considered. But what provision of law is there for compelling the attendance of witnesses before such immigration officer or for taking depositions, and of what avail would be an ex parte inquiry of such witnesses? Must an American citizen, seeking to return to this, his native land, be compelled to bring with him two witnesses to prove the place of his birth, or else be denied his right to return, and all opportunity of establishing his citizenship in the courts of his country? No such rule is enforced against an American citizen of Anglo-Saxon descent, and if this be, as claimed, a government of laws, and not of men, I do not think it should be enforced against American citizens of Chinese descent.\n Again, by Rule 21, the burden of proof is cast upon the applicant, no other evidence is to be accepted except that which the law prescribes, and in every doubtful case the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the government. And by Rule 22 a judicial finding of citizenship is not to be accepted as conclusive unless the party presenting it is 'completely identified.' I showed in my dissenting opinion in Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 740\n, 37 S. L. ed. 905, 922, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1016, that expulsion was punishment. That proposition was not denied by the majority of the court when applied to a citizen, but only as applied to aliens (p. 709, L. ed. p. 912, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 1020). If expulsion from the country is punishment for crime when applied to a citizen, can it be that the rule which requires the government to assume the burden of proof, and which clothes \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 179]\n\u00a0\n the accused with the presumption of innocence can be changed by casting upon the individual the burden of showing that he is one not liable to such punishment? Can it be that the benefit of a doubt which attaches to all other accused persons is taken away from one simply because he is a Chinaman? And can it be that when one produces a judicial can be brushed one side unless the identity can be brushed one side unless the indentity of the individual in whose behalf the finding was made is established beyond doubt?\n In cast no reflections upon the immigration officer in the present case. I am simply challenging a system and provisions which place within the arbitrary power of an individual the denial of the right of an American citizen to free entrance into this country, and put such denial outside the scope of judicial inquiry. It may be true that a ministerial officer, in a secret and private investigation, may strive to ascertain the truth and to do justice, but unless we blind our eyes to the history of the long struggle in the mother country to secure protection to the liberty of the citizen, we must realize that a public investigation before a judicial tribunal, with the assistance of counsel and the privilege of cross-examination, is the best, if not the only, way to secure that result.\n In my judgment we are making a curious judicial history. In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n, 30 S. L. ed. 220, 226, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064, 1070, decided in 1886, we said:\n'The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is not confined to the protection of citizens. It says: 'Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.'\n\n In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 U.S. 649\n, 42 L. ed. 890, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, decided in 1898, the petitioner, a Chinese person born in the United \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 180]\n\u00a0\n States, returning from China, was refused permission to land, and was restrained of his liberty by the collector, the officer then charged with that duty. Without making any appeal from the decision of such local officer, although the law as to appeal to the Secretary was then the same as now, he sued out a writ of habeas corpus from the district court of the United States, which court, after hearing, discharged him on the ground that he was born within the United States, and therefore a citizen thereof. On appeal to this court that decision was affirmed. No one connected with the case doubted that the immigration and exclusion laws had no application to him if he were a citizen, or questioned his right to appeal in the first instance to the courts for his discharge from the illegal restraint.\n In Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 U.S. 193\n, 46 L. ed. 1121, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891, decided in 1902, it appeared that Chin Bak Kan was brought before a commissioner of the United States charged with wrongfully coming in and remaining within the United States. After a hearing he was adjudged guilty of the charge by the commissioner and ordered removed to China. An appeal was taken to the district court of the United States but the appeal was dismissed, and thereupon the case was brought here. The jurisdiction of the commissioner was challenged, and in disposing of that the court said (p. 200, L. ed. p. 1126, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 894):\n'A United States commissioner is a quasi judicial officer, and in these hearings he acts judicially. Moreover, this case was taken by appeal from the commissioner to the judge of the district court, and his decision was affirmed, so that there was an adjudication by a United States judge in the constitutional sense as well as by the commissioner acting as a judge in the sense of the statute.'\n\n In the Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 100\n, 47 S. L. ed. 721, 725, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611, 614, decided in 1903, this court, while sustaining the action of the ministerial officers, said:\n'But this court has never held, nor must we now be understood as holding, that administrative officers, when executing \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 181]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of a statute involving the liberty of persons, may disregard the fundamental principles that inhere in 'due process of law' as understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. One of these principles is that no person shall be deprived of his liberty without opportunity, at some time, to be heard, before such officers, in respect of the matters upon which that liberty depends,-not necessarily an opportunity upon a regular set occasion, and according to the forms of judicial procedure, but one that will secure the prompt, vigorous action contemplated by Congress, and at the same time be appropriate to the nature of the case upon which such officers are required to act. Therefore, it is not competent for the Secretary of the Treasury or any executive officer, at any time within the year limited by the statute, arbitrarily to cause an alien, who has entered the country, and has become subject in all respects to its jurisdiction, and a part of its population, although alleged to be illegally here, to be taken into custody and deported without giving him all opportunity to be heard upon the questions involving his right to be and remain in the United States. No such arbitrary power can exist where the principles involved in due process of law are recognized.'\n\n This was in the case of one confessedly an alien.\n Now the court holds that parties claiming to be citizens can have that claim determined adversely by a mere ministerial officer, and be denied the right of immediate appeal to the courts for a judicial inquiry and determination thereof. I cannot believe that the courts of this Republic are so burdened with controversies about property that they cannot take time to determine the right of personal liberty by one claiming to be a citizen.\n Further, even if it should be proved that these petitioners are not citizens of the United States, but simply Chinese laborers seeking entrance into this country, it may not be amiss to note the significance of the act of April 29, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 176, chap. 641),1 re-enacting and continuing the prior laws respecting the exclusion of the Chinese, 'so far as the same are not inconsistent \n\n[194 U.S. 161, 182]\n\u00a0\n with treaty obligations,' taken in connection with this provision in article 4 of the treaty with China, proclaimed December 8, 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 1210], 'that Chinese laborers or Chinese of any other class, either permanently or temporarily residing in the United States, shall have, for the protection of their persons and property, all rights that are given by the laws of the United States to citizens of the most favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens.' I am not astonished at the report current in the papers that China has declined to continue this treaty for another term of ten years.\n Finally, let me say that the time has been when many young men from China came to our educational institutions to pursue their studies; when her commerce sought our shores, and her people came to build our railroads, and when China looked upon this country as her best friend. If all this be reversed and the most populous nation on earth becomes the great antagonist of this republic, the careful student of history will recall the words of Scripture, 'they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind,' and for cause of such antagonism need look no further than the treatment accorded during the last twenty years by this country to the people of that nation.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Peckham concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1903, p. 188. \n\n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ST ANTHONY R CO(1904)\nNo. 147\nArgued: January 28, 1904Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This action was brought by the United States against the railroad company to recover damages for the unlawful cutting down and conversion by the company, in the year 1899, of certain timber on the public lands belonging to the United States in the state of Idaho. The value of the timber thus cut was, as alleged, over $20,000. The trial was had in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Idaho, southern division, and resulted in a judgment dismissing the complaint, which was affirmed, upon appeal, by the circuit court of appeals, ninth circuit (52 C. C. A. 354, 114 Fed. 722), and the government has appealed to this court.\n The defendant answered the complaint and denied its averments as to unlawfully entering upon the lands and cutting \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 525]\n\u00a0\n the timber. As a further and separate defense the defendant averred that it was duly incorporated on May 18, 1899, under and pursuant to the laws of the state of Idaho, for the purpose of constructing and operating a railroad from the town of Idaho Falls in Bingham county, Idaho, to St. Anthony, in Fremont county, in that state, a distance of approximately 40 miles. On or about July 7, 1899, the board of directors duly adopted the route for the railway, which was practically a straight line between the town of Idaho Falls and the town of St. Anthony, and passed through and over the public lands of the United States. The defendant fully performed all things required by railroad companies by the act of Congress granting to railroads the right of way through the public lands of the United States, approved March 3, 1875, and it thereby became entitled to the benefit of the privileges therein granted to railroad companies. For the purpose of procuring the necessary material with which to construct its railroad, the defendant, through its authorized agents, entered upon the lands described in the complaint, which were, as defendant alleged, adjacent to the line of the railroad, for the purpose of procuring ties and timbers for the construction of the road, and did, during the summer and fall of 1899, cut and remove timber growing on the lands, not to exceed 1,682,975 feet; that the ties and timbers were cut from the nearest public lands to said line of road, and were, as the defendant averred, adjacent thereto; that all the ties and timbers were necessary for the original construction of the road, and were used for that purpose, and the defendant cut and removed the timber in good faith, with no intention of violating any law or committing any trespass, but believing that it had the right to enter upon the lands and take the timber.\n For the purpose of the trial there was an agreed statement of facts made, and therein it was stated that the cutting of the timber was upon the lands of the government and the amount thereof was correctly stated in the answer, and its value upon delivery to the defendant was as alleged in the complaint. \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 526]\n\u00a0\n The defendant did not act under any mistake of fact in regard to the status of the timber and the lands upon which it grew, and did what was done, believing it had the legal right so to do. It is not disputed that the lands were unoccupied, unentered public lands of the United States.\n Upon the question whether the lands where the timber was cut were or were not adjacent, it was agreed:\n'That said lands from the place where said timber was cut to the line of the road were and are the following distances, namely: from 17 to 23 miles by air line; from 20 miles to 25 miles by wagon road, and from 22 to 26 miles following the sinuosities of the river upon which said timber was in part conveyed. By far the larger part of the timber was driven or rafted down said river from said lands to said railroad, the other part being hauled by wagon. The wagon road referred to and so used is an ordinarily good road and involves no unusual grades, and said timber could, with reasonable profit, be hauled by wagon from the place where it was cut to said railroad, where it was used for ties and in the construction of bridges. It is further agreed that there were no other timber lands or suitable timber upon either side of said railroad as near as were the land and timber in question, and that said lands are near enough and so located with reference to said railroad as to be directly and materially benefited thereby.'\n\n The statute under which the cutting is justified is  1 of 'An Act Granting to Railroads the Right of Way Through the Public Lands of the United States,' approved March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 482, chap. 152, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1568), and is set forth in the margin. \n Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the right of way through the public lands of the United States is hereby granted to any railroad company duly organized under the laws of any state or territory, except the District of Columbia, or by the Congress of the United States, which shall have filed with the Secretary of the Interior a copy of its articles of incorporaion, and due proofs of its organization under the same, to the extent of one hundred feet on each side of the central line of said road; also the right to take, from the public lands adjacent to the line of said road, material, earth, stone, and timber necessary for the construction of said railroad; also ground adjacent to such right of way for station buildings, depots, machine shops, sidetracks, turnouts, and water stations, not to exceed in amount twenty acres for each station, to the extent of one station for each ten miles of its road. \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Parley L. Williams for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The important question in this case is as to the meaning of the term 'adjacent' when used in the 1st section of the statute of 1875. The act is a general one, and is therefore applicable to no particular road, except as the facts in each case may bring the road within its language. It grants the right of way through the public lands in the United States upon conditions named, to the extent of 100 feet on each side of the central line of the road. The lands from which materials for the construction of the railroad may be taken must be adjacent to this piece of land but 200 feet wide. The term is a somewhat relative and uncertain one, and in one aspect the case may be determined with at least some reference to the size of the strip or right of way granted, and to which the land must be adjacent. It may also be remembered that the whole length of the road is but 40 miles. In some views of the case the narrowness and shortness of the line might have some effect upon the question of the distance to which the word adjacent might carry one in the search for timber. As the word is frequently uncertain and relative as to its meaning, it might naturally, perhaps, be regarded as more extended when used with reference to a large object than with reference to a comparatively small one. In other words, it must be defined with reference to the context, at least to some extent.\n We are not disposed to unduly limit the meaning of the word as used in the statute so as to exclude lands which might other- \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 531]\n\u00a0\n wise fairly be regarded as within its purpose, and thereby defeat the intent of Congress. The act is not to be construed in an unnecessarily narrow manner, nor, at the same time, should the construction of its language by extraordinarily enlarged in order to attain some special and particular end. In United States v. Denver & R. G. R. Co. \n150 U.S. 1\n, 37 L. ed. 975, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11, another question arose under this same section, and the construction of the act in that regard was certainly as liberal as its language would warrant. It was there held that a railroad company had the right to cut and take the timber or material from public lands adjacent to the line of the road and use the same on portions of its line remote from the place from which it was taken.\n In speaking of the proper construction of the act, it was said by Mr. Justice Jackson, for the court:\n'It is undoubtedly, as urged by the plaintiffs in error, the well- settled rule of this court that public grants are construed strictly against the grantees, but they are not to be so construed as to defeat the intent of the legislature, or to withhold what is given either expressly or by necessary or fair implication. In Winona & St. P. R. Co. v. Barney, \n113 \nU.S. 618, 625\n, 28 S. L. ed. 1109, 1111, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 606, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, thus states the rule upon this subject: 'The acts making the grants . . . are to receive such a construction as will carry out the intent of Congress, however difficult it might be to give full effect to the language used if the grants were by instruments of private conveyance. To ascertain that intent we must look to the condition of the country when the acts were passed, as well as to the purposes declared on their face, and read all parts of them together.'\n\n'Looking to the condition of the country, and the purposes intended to be accomplished by the act, this langugae of the court furnishes the proper rule of construction of the act of 1875. When an act, operating as a general law, and manifesting clearly the intention of Congress to secure public advantages, or to subserve the public interests and welfare by means of benefits more or less valuable, offers to individuals \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 532]\n\u00a0\n or to corporations as an inducement to undertake and accomplish great and expensive enterprises or works of a quasi public character in or through an immense and undeveloped public domain, such legislation stands upon a somewhat different footing from merely a private grant, and should receive at the hands of the court a more liberal construction in favor of the purposes for which it was enacted. Bradley v. New York & N. H. R. Co. 21 Conn. 294; Pierce, Railroads, 491.\n\n'This is the rule, we think, properly applicable to the construction of the act of 1875, rather than the more strict rule of construction adopted in the case of purely private grants; and in view of this character of the act, we are of opinion that the benefits intended for the construction of the railroad, in permitting the use of timber or other material, should be extended to and include the structures mentioned in the act as a part of such railroad.'\n\n It was also said that the railroad should be treated 'as an entirety, in the construction of which it was the purpose of Congress to aid by conferring upon any railway company entitled to the benefits of the act the right to take timber necessary for such construction from the public lands adjacent to the line of the road. This intention would be narrowed, if not defeated, if it were held that the timber which the railway company had the right to take for use in the construction of its line could be rightfully used only upon such portions of the line as might be contiguous to the place from which the timber was taken. If Congress had intended to impose any such restriction upon the use of timber or other material taken from adjacent public lands, it should have been so expressed. No rule of interpretation requires this court to so construe the act as to confine the use of timber that may be taken from a proper place for the purpose of construction to any particular or defined portion of the railroad. To do this would require the court to read into the statute the same language as to the place of use which is found in the statute as to the place of \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 533]\n\u00a0\n taking. In other words, it would require the court to interpolate into the statute the provision that the place at which the timber shall be used shall be 'contiguous, adjoining, or adjacent' to the place from which it is taken. The place of use is not, by the language of the statute, qualified, restricted, or defined, except to the extent of the construction of the railroad as such, and it is not to be inferred from the restriction or limitation imposed as to the place from which it may be rightfully taken that it is to be used only adjacent to such place.'\n In the above case it was admitted that the lands from which the timber was taken were adjacent to the line of the road within the meaning of the statute.\n It is also seen in the extract from the opinion that the word 'adjacent' is therein used in connection with the words 'contiguous' and 'adjoining,' so as to give an impression that it is almost, though not entirely, synonymous with those words. And we think this is true. 'Contiguous, lying close at hand, near,' is the meaning given it by the lexicographers. It need not be adjoining or actually contiguous, but it must be, as said, near or close at hand.\n Although a liberal construction of the statute may be proper and desirable, yet the fair meaning of the language used must not be unduly stretched for the purpose of reaching any particular case which, while it might appeal to the court, would yet pretty plainly be beyond the limitation contained in the statute. While not to be construed so as to defeat the intent of the legislature, or to withhold what is given either expressly or by fair implication, it is surely improper to so extend the ordinary and usual meaning of the word as to permit the railroad company to enter upon any land of the government, as being adjacent, simply because the road wants the timber. The statute was not intended to furnish a general license to the company to enter upon any public land and to range to any extent thereon for timber for its road. In all cases it must be adjacent.\n In the lower Federal courts there have been some cases in \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 534]\n\u00a0\n which the question of the proper construction of this section of the act of Congress received attention. In United States v. Denver & R. G. R. Co. 31 Fed. 886, that land was regarded as adjacent which could be reached by ordinary transportation by wagons. The parties in that case agreed that the timber was cut from lands adjacent to the line of railway, and the question was whether timber thus cut could be taken from lands adjacent to the line of road and used on any part of the line. But the meaning of the word was referred to in the opinion, and it was stated that it depended very much upon the context and the subject-matter to which it should be applied for its proper effect; that with reference to the lands which might be taken for stations, sidetracks, etc., the word 'adjacent' was used in the same sense of 'contiguous' or 'adjoining,' while with reference to material for building the road the word should have the larger significance of nearness without actual contact. It was said to be unreasonable to limit the meaning of the word to the government subdivisions lying next to the right of way, and it was said that the meaning of the term 'adjacent' probably included the right to take timber from public lands within ordinary transportation by wagon. This meaning was arrived at because the company could thus avail itself of all timber which could be so transported with a profit to the company, while excluding other lands from which transportation with profit could not be thus effected. We are not satisfied of the correctness of this construction or of its reasonableness. Lands might in this way be found adjacent which were 50 or 100 or more miles away, and which could not be regarded as adjacent within any meaning of that word heretofore given, and could only be said to be adjacent in order to serve an exigency and to allow a railroad to procure timber gratuitously from the government. The purpose may, perhaps, be good, but the meaning cannot be stretched too far, even to accomplish a possibly desirable end.\n Again, in United States v. Chaplin, 31 Fed. 890, it was held, in the circuit court, district of Oregon, that land was \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 535]\n\u00a0\n adjacent to the line of road within the purpose and intent of the act when, by reason of its proximity thereto, it is directly and materially benefited by the construction of such road. The court said in that case:\n'What is 'adjacent' land within the meaning of the statute must depend on the circumstances of each particular case. Where the 'adjacent' ends and the nonadjacent begins may be difficult to determine. On the theory that the material is taken on account of the benefit resulting to the land from the construction of the road, my impression is that the term 'adjacent' ought not to be construed to include any land save such as, by its proximity to the line of the road, is directly and materially benefited by its construction.'\n\n We fail to see the correctness of this rule. Lands hundreds of miles distant might be directly and materially benefited by the construction of a railroad, and yet be far beyond the utmost extent heretofore supposed to be included by the word adjacent. To give this extended meaning to the word is, as it seems to us, merely to say that Congress might have included lands for that reason if it had so chosen, and, therefore, it is well enough to enlarge the ordinary meaning of the word to accomplish a purpose not plainly stated, but only guessed at.\n In Denver & R. G. R. Co. v. United States, 34 Fed. 838, while the question as to what were adjacent lands was not in issue, as the 4th paragraph in the agreed statement of facts stipulated that the lands from which the timber was cut were adjacent to the line of railway, yet Mr. Justice Brewer, then circuit judge, in his opinion said that he did not agree with the idea that the proximity of the lands was immaterial, or that Congress intended to grant anything like a general right to take timber from public lands where it was most convenient. He said that while the grant was limited to adjacent lands, he did not appreciate the logic which concludes that if there be no timber on adjacent lands, the grant reaches out and justifies taking the timber from distant lands 50 or 100 miles away. The real question in the case was whether timber taken \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 536]\n\u00a0\n from land which was adjacent could be taken to any portion of the road, no matter how distant from the place of cutting. As it was agreed the timber taken was adjacent, it does not appear how far from the line of the road it was cut. The circuit judge, overruling, in this respect, the district judge, held the timber could be used all along the line of the road. This is the same view subsequently taken by this court in \n150 U.S. 1\n, 37 L. ed. 975, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11, supra.\n In Bacheldor v. United States, 28 C. C. A. 246, 55 U. S. App. 227, 83 Fed. 986, it was held by the circuit court of appeals that under the act of June 8, 1872 (17 Stat. at L. 339, chap. 354), which uses language similar to the section in question, the cutting of timber 25 miles from the road was not, as matter of law, unlawful. The question whether the lands were adjacent was held to be a mixed question of law and fact, and the test of illegality was whether the timber was within reasonable hauling distance by wagons. The judgment of the court below ([N. M.] 48 Pac. 310) was therefore reversed.\n In Stone v. United States, 12 C. C. A. 451, 29 U. S. App. 32, 64 Fed. 667, it was held that the act in question did not authorize the taking of timber for the construction of a road from public lands which were 50 miles distant from the end of the road. That case was affirmed in this court. \n167 U.S. 178\n, 42 L. ed. 127, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778. The trial court had charged the jury that, under the act of 1875, the term 'adjacent lands' means lands in proximity, contiguous to, or near to the road, and that lands so far distant from the railroad as lands in Kootenai county, Idaho, where it is claimed that the railroad ties were cut, were not adjacent lands within the meaning of the law. This court concurred with the circuit court of appeals in adjudging the charge to be a sound interpretation of the act.\n The report in the Stone Case showed, as stated in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals, that no timber fit for its use was found along the line of either of the railroads, that both of them penetrated a barren region, almost entirely destitute of timber, and that timber was cut from the lands along the \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 537]\n\u00a0\n line of the Northern Pacific Railroad about 50 miles distant from the eastern end of the other roads, which was the nearest point where available timber could be had.\n We thus have the authority of this court that lands which are adjacent within the meaning of this act of 1875 must be lands in proximity, contiguous or near to, the line of the road. While 'proximity' or 'nearness' to an object is somewhat uncertain as a measure of distance, yet the use of such words as a definition brings to the mind the idea that lands which are in fact far off, or distant, are not adjacent. And the question is whether lands which are 20 miles off can reasonably be described as in proximity or near to a line of road a couple of hundred feet wide. In our belief no one, in describing the locality of such lands, would say they were adjacent to the railroad.\n The above cited cases show a conflict in the minds of the Federal judges as to what are the material facts upon which to base an answer to the question, When are lands adjacent within the meaning of this statute? 'Adjacent,' we admit, is a relative term, and sometimes may depend for its proper application upon the facts in the particular case.\n The matter of the construction of this language was the subject of a letter from Mr. Vilas, who was then Secretary of the Interior, to the Attorney General, dated January 10, 1889, after the decision of the cases in 31 Fed. supra. The Secretary was of the opinion that while nothing in the term 'adjacent,' as used in the statute, rendered it necessary to imply that the lines of survey should be resorted to to define its extent, there was at the same time nothing in this indefiniteness which, in his opinion, could authorize the view that timber or other material could be taken from public lands so far away as may be reached by wagon transportation in a single day, or any other given period of time. He thought that the use of the word 'adjacent' intended and meant the right to the public lands which were conveniently contiguous to the right of way and immediately accessible from it, and he did not believe \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 538]\n\u00a0\n that it was the purpose of Congress or that his department ought to decide that the railroad company could range the public lands to secure material for the construction of the road when it did not happen to exist on those lands which, in the ordinary acceptance of the phrase, would be regarded as adjacent to the right of way. Taking into consideration the whole case, the Secretary was of opinion that it was--\n'As far as sound discretion will warrant executive officers to go until an authoritative decision by the courts, to hold that, under this phrase, material may be taken from the tier of sections through which the right of way extends, as immediately adjoining the right of way, and perhaps an additional tier of sections on either side, as within the idea of 'adjacency.' . . . In view of all the facts and considerations applicable, it is believed the definition and rule given are fair and just, and legitimately to be adopted. I think it wiser and safer to pursue such a rule, subject, as it is, to review by the courts, than to leave the matter open to the varying notions of different officers or the necessities of the companies.' [8 Land Dec. 44.]\n\n There is in our judgment much to be said in favor of this view of the statute. It falls in with the general system adopted by the United States for the survey of its public lands. Those sections touching the line of the road would, of course, be included within the term, while those next to them might also be included, because, although not touching, they would be near to such line, and would, therefore, come within any definition of the term as being close or near to the line without being contiguous to or actually touching it. It is not at all unreasonable to say that very probably Congress had in mind this general system of division of the public lands, and that the word 'adjacent' would properly be interpreted with respect thereto. If the word 'adjoining' had been used instead of 'adjacent,' those sections touching the line of the road could be regarded as the adjoining lands, and when the word 'adjacent' instead of 'adjoining' is used, it might, not unnaturally, be said to include the next tier of sections away \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 539]\n\u00a0\n from the line of the road. We do not think that sections still further removed could, under this rule, be regarded as adjacent, The rule also gives certainty and definiteness to an otherwise somewhat doubtful expression, and, as the Secretary says, prevents the companies from ranging the public lands to secure material for the construction of their roads, and thus raising questions of legality in cutting in almost every case where the lands were beyond the sections described by the Secretary. This alone is an important consideration.\n If not bounded by section lines, the term 'adjacent' becomes of more or less uncertain meaning. We cannot, however, conclude that within any fair construction of the statute, these lands were in any event adjacent to the line of the road. The word is also used in the same section, when speaking of the use of ground adjacent to the right of way for purposes of depots, machine shops, etc. In such use it is clear the word is greatly limited. We take it there is a limit beyond which lands could not be described as adjacent to the line of the railroad, even if they were benefited by its construction and were the nearest public lands upon which timber could be found, and the timber thereon could be transported by wagon with profit to the company. Lands which are 20 miles off we cannot regard as adjacent to the line of a railroad within the meaning of this statute. On the other hand, lands within 2 miles, we assume all would agree, are so adjacent. Now, at what point between these two extremes lands are on one side adjacent and on the other not adjacent, is a very difficult matter to decide. It is necessarily somewhat vague and uncertain, and we are not called upon to determine it in this case. All we have to do now is to declare that lands as far off as the lands in question are not adjacent lands, and it is unnecessary to say at what point on the intervening lands adjacency begins. It is very difficult to determine just where twilight ends and night begins, but it is easy enough to distinguish noon from midnight. If we say that 2 miles would be within the term and 20 would be beyond it, it might be asked why 19 \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 540]\n\u00a0\n miles would not also be beyond it, or 3 miles be within it, and these questions might puzzle one to answer. It can only be said that a distance of 20 miles is beyond it any way and 2 miles would be within it. If, then, short distances be proposed and an answer requested as to whether they are or are not within of without the limit, each division might be so small that no clear and decided difference could be asserted between it and the land immediately adjoining, and so it might result in no difference being stated between two and twenty, and yet we know there is a division and it lies somewhere between those two points. The nearer an approach is made to a junction between what is stated to be the adjacent and the nonadjacent lands, the more difficult it becomes to show any difference warranting a different decision, and yet, as we have said, there is a point at which there can be no doubt. We think 20 miles is certainly beyond any fair distance in which lands could be said to be adjacent to the line of this road. And we say this while fully recognizing and keeping in mind the liberal rule of construction set forth by this court in the Denver Railroad Case, \n150 U.S. 1\n, 37 L. ed. 975, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11, supra. We appreciate the fact that the act was passed to 'secure public advantages and to subserve the public interests,' but nevertheless it does not grant free license to roam the public lands and take timber wherever thereon it may be found, or wherever by possibility it might be taken with profit to the company. The statute says that the lands must be adjacent, and there must, of necessity, therefore, be a point where the lands are not adjacent, even though the timber might be removed therefrom with some possible profit to the company. As Congress has not given the definition of adjacent, such as has been adopted by any of the lower courts, we cannot, even by a so-called liberal construction, enlarge the ordinary meaning of the word to the extent made necessary in order to justify this cutting.\n We cannot take, for the reasons already stated, the fact of wagon road transportation as a means of deciding whether the lands are or are not adjacent, for it seems to us that it may lead \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 541]\n\u00a0\n us far beyond any reasonable limit to the word. The same may be said as to the benefits to the land by the building of the road. That also would in many cases lead too far from the line. In this case most of the transportation was done by water, the timber being driven or rafted down the river, and in that way the distance was from 22 to 26 miles, although such timber might have been hauled by wagon with reasonable profit. Now, suppose the nearest timber lands of the government were 100 miles away, but, by reason of water communication, the timber could be floated down to the line of the road 'with reasonable profit,'-would such lands then be adjacent? We think clearly not. And it is because of the fact that the distance would be plainly too great to conform to any of the meanings which have heretofore been given to the word. It strikes one so at first blush. We are of opinion that the same ought to be said of these lands. They are not adjacent, for they are not near; they are not in close proximity to this strip of land 200 feet wide. This ordinary limitation of the meaning of the word should not be enlarged for the purpose of thereby embracing lands which otherwise would not come within any fair construction of the statute.\n The further question is as to the time when the value of the timber is to be ascertained.\n The parties agreed that the amount of the timber growing on the lands is correctly stated in the answer, and the value thereof at the place where the timber was cut was $1.50 per thousand feet and the value upon delivery to the defendant was $12.35 per thousand feet. The delivery to the defendant was made by the Thompson Mercantile Company, with which the railroad company had entered into a contract to be supplied with the necessary ties and timbers for the construction of its road, and in such contract the mercantile company was, by the expressed terms thereof, appointed the agent of the defendant, and in that capacity it was authorized by the defendant to cut timber for the purpose mentioned. The \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 542]\n\u00a0\n mercantile company did cut the timber on the lands which it in good faith supposed were adjacent to the line of the railroad, and delivered such timber to the railroad company upon the line of its road. We think the measure of damages should be the value of the timber after it was cut at the place where it was cut. The defendant does not, in our judgment, come within either the case of E. E. Bolles Wooden-Ware Co. v. United States, \n106 U.S. 432\n, 27 L. ed. 230, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398, or that of Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, \n186 U.S. 279\n, 46 L. ed. 1164, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 920. In both of those cases the parties doing the cutting did it wilfully and in bad faith. In the Wooden-Ware Case the timber was sold by the original trespasser to a third party without notice of the trespass, and the party purchasing was guilty of no wilful wrong. It was, however, held that the defendant, having purchased from the original wrongdoer and wilful trespasser, was liable for the value of the timber at the time and place it was purchased by defendant.\n In the Pine River Logging Case, the parties to the contract were held liable for the full value of the timber after it was cut and had increased in value by reason of the labor expended upon it by the parties who did the cutting. This was on the ground that they were wilful trespassers, acting in bad faith, and ought to be made to suffer some punishment for their depredations; but it was stated that where the trespass is the result of inadvertence or mistake, and the wrong was not intentional, the value of the property when first taken must govern.\n Although in this case it is agreed that the defendant did not act under a mistake, meaning thereby that the facts touching the status of the timber and the lands where the timber was cut were known, yet what was done was in the belief by the defendant that the lands were adjacent to the line of the road and that the cutting was legal. It was done upon the advice of counsel, and the defendant used ordinary care and prudence in first being advised as to the law upon the facts as they have been agreed upon, and there was no intention on the part of \n\n[192 U.S. 524, 543]\n\u00a0\n the defendant to violate any law or to do any wrongful act. This, we think, clearly takes the case out of the principle of those above cited, and the measure of damages must, therefore, be the value of the timber at the time and at the place where it was cut.\n The judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for the District of Idaho, Southern Division, with directions to enter judgment in favor of the United States for the amount of the timber as stated in the answer, and for its value at the rate of $1.50 per thousand feet.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. THOMAS(1904)\nNo. 94\nArgued: October 11, 1904Decided: December 5, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This was a petition for certain allowances claimed to be due petitioner as a captain in the United States Navy, under act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1007, chap. 413, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1072), equalizing the pay of Army and Navy officers, and known as the Navy personnel act. The findings of fact are too long to be here reproduced, but the several items claimed by petitioner, and from the disposition of which these appeals are taken, are cited by counsel in their brief and by the court of claims as follows:\n\n 1. \nFrom May 26, 1900, to March 1, 1901, he was paid sea pay of a captain, at $4,500 a year, and claims 10 per cent increase of this pay for services in the Philippines and in China, under the acts of May 26, 1900, and March 2, 1901. 31 Stat. at L. 211, chap. 586, and 31 Stat. at L. 903, chap. 803, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896.\n\n 2. \nFrom March 2, 1901, to June 11, 1901, he was paid the sea pay of a captain,-$4,500 a year,-and claims 10 per cent \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 419]\n\u00a0\n increase of this pay for service outside the United States, under the provisions of the act of March 2, 1901\n\n\n 3. From June 12, 1901, to September 30, 1901, he was paid sea pay at $ 4,500 a year, and claims 10 per cent increase under the act of March 2, 1901, for service outside the United States. During this time he was in the waters of the San Francisco bay, traveling from San Francisco to Puget sound, and in the waters of Puget sound. This claim is made provisionally in case his service in Chinese and Philippine waters is not considered to be service 'in China' and 'in the Philippine islands,' entitling him to 10 per cent increase from May 26, 1900, to March 1, 1901. In that event he would claim that his service in waters of the United States was beyond the limits of the states comprising the Union.\n\n 4. \nBetween December 2, 1899, when relieved as commanding officer of the U. S. S. Lancaster, and ordered to report to the Navy Department, and February 7, 1900, when he took command of the U. S. S. Baltimore at Hong Kong, China, he was paid only shore pay,-$3,825 a year,-15 per cent less than pay,-$3,825 a year,-15 per cent less than during that time.\n The last item was disallowed. The first three items were at first disallowed, but, on a rehearing, were allowed and final judgment rendered for $568.29. 38 Ct. Cl. 113, 719. Both parties appealed to this court.\n Messrs. George A. King and William B. King for Thomas.\n Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. John Q. Thompson for the United States.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brown:\n\n Mr. Justice Brown delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case depends upon the construction given to  13 \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 420]\n\u00a0\n of the Navy personnel act, declaring that 'after June 30, 1899, commissioned officers of the line of the Navy and of the medical and pay corps shall receive the same pay and allowances, except forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for officers of corresponding rank in the Army.' The object of this act can best be understood by considering the prior legislation of Congress upon the same general subject, and the circumstances under which the act was passed. By the act of July 16, 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 585, chap. 183] (Rev. Stat.  1466, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1030), the relative rank of Army and Navy officers was fixed by declaring that rear admirals shall rank with major generals, commodores with brigadier generals, captains with colonels, commanders with lieutenant colonels, lieutenant commanders with majors, lieutenants with captains, etc.\n It was, however, a source of dissatisfaction to Navy officers that some of them did not receive the same pay as corresponding officers of the Army, although others received a larger pay. Thus, by  1261 and 1556 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 893, 1067), the highest pay of a rear admiral, when at sea, was $6,000, while a major general received $7,500; a commodore received $5,000 when at sea, while a brigadier general received $ 5,500. A captain, however, when at sea received $4,500, while a colonel received but $3,500.\n To remove this dissatisfaction Congress passed the Navy personnel act, assimilating the pay of Navy officers to Army officers of corresponding rank, with a proviso, however, 'that no provision of this act shall operate to reduce the present pay of any commissioned officer now in the Navy; and in any case in which the pay of such an officer would otherwise be reduced he shall continue to receive pay according to existing law.'\n The effect of this legislation was to raise the pay of certain Navy officers to that received by Army officers of corresponding rank and to leave undisturbed the present pay of certain other Navy officers, who were already receiving higher pay than Army officers of the same rank.\n The intention of Congress was evidently to put officers of \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 421]\n\u00a0\n the Army and Navy on the same footing with respect to their general pay, and to make the act prospective in its application to future legislation, so that if Congress should thereafter raise the general pay of Army officers as fixed by Revised Statutes,  1261, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 893, a like increase should apply to Navy officers. It does not, however, follow that Congress may not increase the pay of Army officers for services in particular places or under special circumstances, without thereby intending that the same increase shall apply to naval officers performing the same service under like circumstances. Thus, if the act should allow Army officers increased pay when ordered to sea or to a foreign port, it would not follow that naval officers would be entitled to a like increase, since such service would be wholly exceptional in the case of Army officers, while it is the natural and normal duty of Navy officers to engage in sea service, cruise in foreign waters, and lie up in foreign ports. It never could have been the intention of Congress to disable itself from awarding to a particular class of Army officers an increase of pay for exceptional services without thereby increasing the pay of Navy officers, whose lives are largely passed in performing like services.\n Confirmation of this view is found in the 2d proviso of  13, 'that when naval officers are detailed for shore duty beyond seas they shall receive the same pay and allowances as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for officers of the Army detailed for duty in similar places.' Here is a distinct recognition of the fact that when naval officers are detailed for a special or unusual duty beyond seas, they shall receive the same pay as Army officers detailed for the same duties. This provision, however, would be wholly unnecessary if the act were given the broad application contended for, since the increased pay allowed to Army officers for duty beyond seas would apply to naval officers, without a special proviso to that effect. Shore duty beyond seas being an exceptional duty, both to officers of the Army and Navy, and being probably attended by increased expenditures, and dangers incident to \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 422]\n\u00a0\n a tropical climate, it is very natural that Congress should award them both increased compensation.\n The principal questions in this case, however, arise from the Army appropriation bills of May 26, 1900, and March 2, 1901, making appropriation for the support of the Army for the year ending June 30, 1901, and 1902, the first of which contains the following proviso:\n'Provided, That hereafter the pay proper of all officers and enlisted men serving in Porto Rico, Cuba, the Philippine islands, Hawaii, and in the territory of Alaska, shall be increased 10 per cent for officers and 20 per cent for enlisted men, over and above the rates of pay proper as fixed by law in time of peace.' 31 Stat. at L. 211, chap. 586.\n\n Here is an increase of 10 per cent allowed to Army officers serving in certain designated places. Doubtless if naval officers were detailed for shore duty in any of these islands they would receive a like increase of pay, under the proviso of  13 of the personnel act, heretofore quoted. But, unless they are detailed for shore duty, it is impossible to hold that they are entitled to extra pay, without treating as obsolete the above proviso requiring such detail.\n The act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 903, chap. 803, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896), making appropriation for the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, contains the following proviso:\n'Provided, That hereafter the pay proper of all officers and enlisted men serving beyond the limits of the states comprising the Union, and the territories of the United States contiguous thereto, shall be increased 10 per centum for officers and 20 per centum for enlisted men, over and above the rates of pay proper as fixed by law for time of peace, and the time of such service shall be counted from the date of departure from said states to the date of return thereto:\n\n'Provided further, That the officers and enlisted men who have served in China at any time since the 26th day of May, 1900, shall be allowed and paid for such service the same increase of pay proper as is herein provided for.' \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 423]\n\u00a0\n Under this proviso an Army officer ordered to the Philippine islands receives an increase of pay from the day he leaves San Francisco until he returns there. This allowance was undoubtedly based upon the consideration that service, both in the Philippines themselves and upon the voyage going and returning, was an exceptional service, attended by peculiar hardships; but to say that Navy officers shall be entitled to the same increase is practically to add 10 per cent to their sea pay from the moment they leave a port of the United States until they return thereto; in other words, to increase their normal sea pay 10 per cent whenever they are serving beyond the limits of the states.\n\n So far as applied to naval officers, it goes further than this. The act of 1901 does not, as did the act of 1900, limit the increase of pay to officers serving in our island possessions and in Alaska, but extends it to all serving beyond the limits of the United States, so that, if applied to naval officers, whenever a vessel is ordered to sea beyond the 3-mile limit, be it only upon a practice cruise or a voyage from Pensacola to New York, every officer on such vessel is entitled to a 10 per cent increase of his ordinary pay from the day he sets sail until the day he returns.\n It is not for a moment to be supposed that Congress contemplated any such sweeping innovation. This construction would not only render nugatory and obsolete the proviso of the personnel act that officers, to be entitled to Army pay, shall be detailed for shore duty, but largely discriminates in favor of naval officers by adding 10 per cent to their pay for their normal sea duties without a corresponding addition to the pay of Army officers for the performance of their normal duties, which are upon land; in other words, instead of assimilating the pay of Army and naval officers, it actually dissimilates them.\n In our opinion the proviso that naval officers shall be entitled to Army pay 'when detailed for shore duty beyond seas' is not repealed or rendered inoperative by anything contained \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 424]\n\u00a0\n in the acts of May 26, 1900, and March 2, 1901, and that naval officers are not entitled to an increase of pay while discharging their ordinary sea duties.\n It is significant in this connection to notice that in the appropriation act of March 2, 1901, for the support of the Army for the fiscal year of 1902, there was an item of $500,000, for an 'additional 10 per centum increase on the pay of officers serving at foreign stations.' 31 Stat. at L. 903, chap. 803. This was followed by a similar provision in the appropriation act of June 30, 1902 for the year of 1903, the amount appropriated being $451,456 (32 Stat. at L. 507-512, chap. 1328), and in the Army appropriation act of March 2, 1903, for the year 1904, there was also an item of $200,000, for the same purpose. 32 Stat. at L. 933, chap. 975. So also in the appropriation act of April 23, 1904 (33 Stat. at L. 259-266), for the year 1905, there is an item for an additional 10 per centum increase on the pay of commissioned officers serving in the Philippine islands, the island of Guam, Alaska, China, and Panama, of $167, 426.30.\n Notwithstanding these repeated provisions for the increase of Army pay, Congress has never made an appropriation for the largely increased pay to which naval officers would be entitled under the acts of 1900 and 1901, or otherwise recognized their claim for inoreased pay to which such officers would be entitled upon the theory of the petitioner in this case. This omission lends support to the theory that Congress supposed that the ordinary sea services of naval officers were sufficiently compensated by the addition of 15 per centum to their shore pay.\n\n 2. \nDifferent considerations apply to the claim of petitioner to sea pay from December 2, 1899, to February 7, 1900. Claimant was relieved as commanding officer of the Laneaster, then at Barbadoes, December 2, 1899, and ordered to report to the Navy Department, where he arrived, by merchant steamer, December 12, 1899. Upon the following day he was ordered to proceed to Hong Kong, for duty on the Asiatic station, and sailed by merchant steamer from San Francisco, \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 425]\n\u00a0\n January 6, 1900. He reported in obedience to his orders, and was assigned to the command of the Balitmore at Hong Kong, February 7, 1900. Between December 2, 1899, and February 7, 1900, petitioner was occupied in traveling on duty, partly on merchant steamer and partly on land, and in reporting to the Navy Department. During this time his pay was reduced 15 per cent from the regular sea pay, in accordance with the first proviso of the personnel act, which declares that 'such officers, when on shore, shall receive the allowances, but 15 per centum less pay than when on sea duty.'\n The order detaching him from the Lancaster was as follows:\n Sir: You are hereby detached from duty in command of the U. S. T. S. Lancaster, will proceed immediately to Washington, D. C., and report at the Navy Department, at that place, for special temporary duty.\n Hold yourself in readiness for orders to sea duty.\n This employment on shore duty is required by the public interest.\n Respectfully,\n (Sgd.) A. S. Crowninshield,\n Acting Secretary.\n Captain Charles M. Thomas, U. S. N.,\n U. S. T. S. Laneaster.\n The next day, after reporting to the Navy Department under this order, he was ordered to proceed to San Francisco, California, and thence to Hong Kong. It thus appears that while he was not regularly detailed for shore duty, he was ordered to report at the Navy Department for a special temporary duty, and the final sentence of the letter indicates that it was regarded as an employment on shore duty. He was allowed by the Department $ 50 traveling expenses from Barbadoes to New York, but was not allowed either mileage or sea pay. The court of claims, however, allowed him mileage under  13 of the Navy personnel act, and \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 426]\n\u00a0\n a clause of the army appropriation act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1064, 1068, chap. 423), providing 'that hereafter the maximum sum to be allowed and paid to any officer of the Army shall be seven cents per mile, distances to be computed over the shortest usually traveled routes;' but mileage seems not to have been claimed for his traveling from Washington to Hong Kong, by reason of the further provision of the same act 'that actual expenses only shall be paid to officers when traveling to and from our island possessions in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.' The government apparently acquiesced in this allowance of milleage, as it made no appeal therefrom.\n But the court of claims further held that, under Rev. Stat.  1571, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1079, he was not entitled to sea pay, because, by that section, 'no service shall be regarded as sea service except such as shall be performed at sea, under the orders of a department, and in vessels employed by authority of law.'\n This construction must necessarily be correct, unless we are prepared to hold that a steamer upon which a navel officer takes possage under the orders of the department is a 'vessel employed by authority of law.' Obviously, it does not admit of this construction. A person who takes passage upon a steamer or a seat in a railway carriage does not 'employ' such steamer or carriage in any just sense. We think the term 'vessels employed by authority of law' is restricted to vessels owned or chartered by the government, or otherwise engaged in the service of the United States.\n Sea duty being duty at sea upon such vessels, an allowance for mileage is obviously inconsistent with such duty, as the pay of the officer necessarily includes travel upon such vessels; while it is appropriate to shore duty, since travel upon such duty is performed either upon land or upon vessels not engaged in government service.\n There is nothing in the Navy personnel act inconsistent with or repealing Rev. Stat.  1571, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1079, and the case of Gibson v. United States, \n194 U.S. 182\n, 48 L. ed. 926, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 613, is not in point. In that case it was held that the personnel act did repeal  1578 \n\n[195 U.S. 418, 427]\n\u00a0\n and 1585 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1083, 1085), allowing sea rations, because the later act covered the same subject, and superseded the provisions of those sections. There is no such conflict between  1571 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1079) and the personnel act.\n The ruling of the Court of Claims in this last particular was correct; but for the error in the I evious ruling the decree must be reversed.\n On January 3, 1905, Mr. Justice Brown announced that the judgment of December 5, 1904, was amended by remanding the case, with directions to reinstate the original judgment for $97.42. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. EX REL. HOLZENDORF v. HAY(1904)\nNo. 210\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n The relator, plaintiff in error, filed his petition in the Su- \n\n[194 U.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of the District ofColumbia, praying a writ of mandamus directed to the then and present Secretary of State of the United States. In substance it was averred that Holzendorf, prior to and since May, 1898, had been a naturalized citizen of the United States, and while on a visit to Germany, his native country, he was wrongfully imprisoned in an asylum for the insane at Dalldorf, near Berlin, from May 11, 1898, to July 8, 1899, when he was released by the judgment of a German court, as being 'perfectly sound in mind and body.' The grievance complained of was alleged to have been the act of the German Empire, and it was averred that said grievance 'was manifestly in contempt of his rights as a citizen of the United States,' which 'oppressively deprived him of liberty, reputation, and time, greatly to his cost, loss, damage, and injury.' Alleging a refusal by the defendant in mandamus 'to proceed, on the part of the United States, to seek to obtain redress of grievance in behalf of your petitioner,' it was prayed that a writ of mandamus issue, 'addressed to said defendant, John Hay, the Secretary aforesaid, commanding and requiring him forthwith to institute vigorous and proper proceedings against the Empire of Germany, or Kingdom of Prussia, or both, that is to say, against the Emperor, for the recovery of $500,000 damages, in behalf of your petitioner.'\n The matter was heard, and an order was entered, dismissing the petition. An appeal was allowed, and the court of appeals of the District affirmed the judgment. 20 App. D. C. 576. By writ of error the cause was then brought to this court.\n Messrs. R. S. Tharin and A. E. L. Leckie for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The relief demanded was denied by the court below sub- \n\n[194 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n stantially upon the ground that no legal duty rested upon the defendant to do the act the performance of which it was the purpose of the proceeding to coerce, because such act concerned the political department of the government, involving solely the exercise of official discretion, which was not subject to judicial control. Without intimating in the slightest degree that the dismissal was not justified upon the ground referred to, we are compelled to dispose of the case upon the objection made to the want of jurisdiction in this court to entertain the writ of error.\n It is provided in the Code of the District of Columbia (31 Stat. at L. 1227, chap. 854), as follows:\n'Sec. 233. Any final judgment or decree of the court of appeals may be re-examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in all cases in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars, in the same manner, and under the same regulations, as existed in cases of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia on February ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and also in cases, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in dispute, wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States.'\n\n It is clear, therefore, unless the case is one in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum of $5,000, we have no power to review the final judgment of the court of appeals in this case.\n The meaning of the term 'matter in dispute,' as employed in prior and analogous statutes regulating appeals from the courts of the District of Columbia, has been considered in previous decisions of this court, to one only of which we shall specially refer.\n In South Carolina v. Seymour, \n153 U.S. 353\n, 38 L. ed. 742, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 871, the court had \n\n[194 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n under consideration  8 of the act of 1893 [27 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 74, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573] referred to in  233 of the District Code, supra. Particularly discussing the preliminary provision conferring jurisdiction upon this court where 'the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars,' the court said (p. 357, L. ed. p. 744, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 873):\n'In order to bring a case within the first alternative, the matter in dispute, according to the settled construction, must be money, or some right the value of which can be estimated and ascertained in money, and which appears by the record to be of the requisite pecuniary value.'\n\n Now, assuming that the term 'matter in dispute' may embrace a right to have a claim against a foreign government presented through the political department of the United States, and that the value of such a right may be gauged by the possible pecuniary injury which may be sustained if no such action is taken, it is yet evident that the claim under consideration is one haveing merely a conjectural value. The 'matter in dispute,' as respects a money demand, has relation to justiciable demands. Now, the averments in the petition for mandamus in this case do not, under the priciples of the law of false imprisonment prevailing in this country, state a cause of action even against individuals, much less against a sovereignty; nor is it shown that the alleged wrong was actionable under the laws of Germany. So far as appears, the right to assert the demand in question upon the German Empire is merely a right to appeal to the grace of that country. The value of such a right is manifestly purely conjectural, and not susceptible of a pecuniary estimate. It certainly cannot be said to have the value declared by the statute to be essential to our power to entertain a writ of error. The writ of error must therefore be dismissed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown think the judgment should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. EX REL. TURNER v. WILLIAMS(1904)\nNo. 561\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1904\n\n\n\n\n\n[194 U.S. 279, 280]\n\u00a0\n John Turner filed in the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, October 26, 1903, a petition alleging--\n'First. That on October 23, in the city of New York, your relator was arrested by divers persons claiming to be acting by authority of the government of the United States, and was by said persons conveyed to the United States immigration station at Ellis island, in the harbor of New York, and is now there imprisoned by the commissioner of immigration of the port of New York.\n\n'Second. Your relator is so imprisoned by virtue of a warrant sworn out by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor, which warrant charges your relator with being an anarchist, and being unlawfully within the United States, in violation of  2 and  20 of the immigration laws of the United States, as amended by act of March 3, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012]\n\n'Third. Upon information and belief, that a special board of inquiry, consisting of Charles Semsey, Captain Weldon, supervising inspector, and L. C. Stewart, all of whom are executive officers of the United States, has inquired into your relator's case, and decided that your relator is an anarchist, and is in the United States in violation of law, within the meaning of the act of March 3, 1903\n\n\n\n'Fourth. Your relator denies that he is an anarchist within the meaning of the immigration laws of the United States, and states to the court that about six years ago he took out his first papers of application for citizenship in this country, and that he has at no times been engaged as a propagandist of doctrines inciting to, or advising, violent overthrow of government, but for about six years last past he has been the paid organizer of the retail clerks of Great Britain, and his business \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 281]\n\u00a0\n in this country is solely to promote the interests of organized labor, and that he has at all times conducted himself as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen.\n\n'By reason of all of which facts your relator says that his imprisonment is illegal, in that he is being deprived of his liberty without due process of law, and is being denied equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States.'\n\n -and praying for a writ of habeas corpus to the commissioner of immigration of the port of New York, and also for a writ of certiorari to bring up the record of the board of inquiry which adjudged him to be an anarchist and in the United States in violation of the immigration laws. The commissioner made return under oath, and also certified the record of the board of inquiry.\n The return stated--\n'That the above-named John Turner is an alien, a subject of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; that said alien came to the United States from England on, or about ten days prior to, October 24, 1903, as deponent is informed and believes.\n\n'Said John Turner was arrested in the city of New York on or about October 23, 1903, under a warrant issued by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor of the United States, and was taken to the Ellis island immigration station, where he was examined by a board of special inquiry, duly constituted according to law, upon his right to remain in this country, and that said alien was, by said board, found to be an alien anarchist, and was, by unanimous decision of said board, ordered to be deported to the country from whence he came, as a person within the United States in violation of law. That on October 26, 1903, said alien appealed from the said decision of the board of special inquiry to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, who dismissed the appeal, and directed that said alien be deported to the country from whence he came, upon the ground that said alien is an anar- \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 282]\n\u00a0\n chist and a person who disbelieves in, and who is opposed to, all organized government, and was found to be in the United States in violation of law.\n\n'That annexed hereto is a copy of the above mentioned warrant for the arrest and deportation of said John Turner, and copies of the minutes of said hearing before the board of special inquiry, and a copy of the order or decision of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor dismissing said appeal, and again directing deportation. That said John Turner is now held in deponent's custody at the Ellis island immigration station, pending deportation to the country from whence he came, in accordance with the above-mentioned decision or order of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.'\n\n The warrant issued by the Secretary was addressed to certain United States immigrant inspectors, and recited that from the proofs submitted the Secretary was satisfied that Turner, an alien anarchist, came into this country contrary to the prohibition of the act of Congress of March 3, 1903, and commanded them to take him into custody, and return him to the country from whence he came, at the expense of the United States. On appeal to the Secretary the record of proceedings before the board of inquiry was transmitted, and the Secretary held: 'The evidence shows that the appellant declined to give exact information as to the manner in which he secured admission to this country, although he swears that he arrived here about ten days ago. He admits that he is an anarchist and an advocate of anarchistic principles, which brings him within the class defined by  38 of the act approved March 3, 1903.2 In view of these facts, the appeal is dismissed, and you are directed to deport the said John Turner, in conformity with warrant now in your hands for execution.'\n The hearing before the board of inquiry was had October 24, 1903, and it appeared from the minutes thereof that Turner testified that he was an Englishman; that he had been in the United States ten days, and that he did not come through New York, but declined to either affirm or deny that he arrived \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 283]\n\u00a0\n via Canada; that he would not undertake to deny that he had, in the lecture delivered in New York, October 23, declared himself to be an anarchist, which, he said, was a statement that he would make; and that the testimony of the inspectors was about correct. That evidence gave extracts from the address referred to, including these: 'Just imagine what a universal tie-up would mean. What would it mean in New York city alone if this idea of solidarity were spread through the city? If no work was being done, if it were Sunday for a week or a fortnight, life in New York would be impossible, and the workers, gaining audacity, would refuse to recognize the authority of their employers, and eventually take to themselves the handling of the industries. . . . All over Europe they are preparing for a general strike, which will spread over the entire industrial world. Everywhere the employers are organizing, and to me, at any rate, as an anarchist, as one who believes that the people should emancipate themselves, I look forward to this struggle as an opportunity for the workers to assert the power that is really theirs.'\n Certain papers were found on Turner, one of them being a list of his proposed series of lectures (which, when the warrant was in execution, he rolled up and threw away), the subjects including: 'The Legal Murder of 1887,' and 'The Essentials of Anarchism;' notices of meetings, one of a mass-meeting November 9, at which 'speeches will be delivered by John Turner in English, John Most, in German, and several other speakers. Don't miss this opportunity to hear the truth expressed about the great Chicago tragedy on the eleventh of November, 1887;' and another, stating: 'It may be interesting to all that Turner has recently refused to accept a candidacy to Parliament because of his anarchistic principles.'\n A demurrer was interposed to the return, and, after argument, the circuit court dismissed the writ and remanded the petitioner. 126 Fed. 253. From this order an appeal was prayed and allowed to this court, and, having been docketed, petitioner was admitted to bail. \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 284]\n\u00a0\n Sections 2 and 38 of the act of March 3, 1903, entitled 'An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United States' (32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012), are as follows:\n'Sec. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: All idiots, insane persons, epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons who have been convicted of a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all government or of all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials; prostitutes, and persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes or women for the purpose of prostitution; those who have been, within one year from the date of the application for admission to the United States, deported as being under offers, solicitations, promises or agreements to perform labor or service of some kind therein; and also any person whose ticket or passage is paid for with the money of another, or who is assisted by others to come, unless it is affirmatively and satisfactorily shown that such person does not belong to one of the foregoing excluded classes; but this section shall not be held to prevent persons living in the United States from sending for a relative or friend who is not of the foregoing excluded classes: Provided, That nothing in this act shall exclude persons convicted of an offense purely political, not involving moral turpitude: And provided further, That skilled labor may be imported, if labor of like kind unemployed cannot be found in this country: And provided further, That the provisions of this law applicable to contract labor shall not be held to exclude professional actors, artists, lecturers, singers, ministers of any religious denomination, professors for colleges or seminaries, persons \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 285]\n\u00a0\n belonging to any recognized learned profession, or persons employed strictly as personal or domestic servants.'\n\n'Sec. 38. That no person who disbelieves in, or who is opposed to, all organized government, or who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization entertaining and teaching such disbelief in, or opposition to, all organized government, or who advocates or teaches the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers, either of specific individuals or of officers generally, of the government of the United States or of any other organized government, because of his or their official character, shall be permitted to enter the United States or any territory or place subject to the jurisdiction thereof. This section shall be enforced by the Secretary of the Treasury, under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe.\n\n'That any person who knowingly aids or assists any such person to enter the United States or any territory or place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or who connives or conspires with any person or persons to allow, procure, or permit any such person to enter therein, except pursuant to such rules and regulations made by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned for not less than one nor more than five years, or both.'\n\n By the act of February 14, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 825, chap. 552),3 'To Establish the Department of Commerce and Labor,' the jurisdiction, supervision, and control possessed and exercised by the Department of the Treasury over the immigration of aliens into the United States were transferred to the Department of Commerce and Labor established by the act, to take effect and be in force the first day of July, 1903.\nMessrs. Edgar L. Masters and Clarence S. Darrow for appellant.\n\n\n[194 U.S. 279, 289]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for the appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n This appeal was taken directly to this court on the ground that the case involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the UnitedStates, and that the constitutionality of a law of the United States was drawn in question; and although it may be, as argued by the government, that the principles which must control our decision have been practically settled, we think, the whole record considered, that we are not constrained to dismiss the appeal for that reason.\n It is contended that the act of March 3, 1903, is unconstitutional because in contravention of the 1st, 5th, and 6th articles of amendment of the Constitution, and of  1 of article 3 of that instrument; and because no power 'is delegated by the Constitution to the general government over alien friends with reference to their admission into the United States or otherwise, or over the beliefs of citizens, denizens, sojourners, or aliens, or over the freedom of speech or of the press.'\n Repeated decisions of this court have determined that Congress has the power to exclude aliens from the United States; to prescribe the terms and conditions of which they may come in; to establish regulations for sending out of the country such aliens as have entered in violation of law, and to commit the enforcement of such conditions and regulations to executive \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 290]\n\u00a0\n officers; that the deportation of an alien who is found to be here in violation of law is not a deprivation of liberty without due process of law, and that the provisions of the Constitution securing the right of trial by jury have no application.

Sing Tuck, \n194 U.S. 161\n, ante, 621, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep.621.\n In the case last cited the distinction on whichGonzales v. Williams, \n192 U.S. 1\n, ante, p. 177, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177, turned was pointed out. The question whether a citizen of Porto Rico, under the treaty of cession [ 30 Stat. at L. 1754] and the act of April 12, 1900 [31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191], came within the immigration law of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 1084, chap. 551, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1294], was purely a question of law, which, beingdecided in the negative, all questions of fact became immaterial.\n In the present case alienage was conceded, and was not in dispute, and it was the question of fact thereupon arising that was passed on by theboard, and by the Secretary on appeal.\n Whether rested on theaccepted principle of international law, that every sovereign nation has the power, as inherent in sovereignty and essential to self-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions, or to admit them only in such cases and upon such conditions as it may see fit to prescribe; or on the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, which includes the entrance of ships, the importation of goods, and the bringing of persons into the ports of the United States, the act before us is not open to constitutional objection. And while we held in Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 U.S. 228\n, 41 L. ed. 140, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 977, a certain provision of an immigration law invalid on thatground, this act does not come within the ruling.\n In that case Mr.Justice Shiras, speaking for the court, said:\n'We regard it assettled by our previous decisions that the \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 291]\n\u00a0\n United States can, as a matter of public policy, by Congressional enactment, forbid aliens or classes of aliens from coming within their borders, and expel aliens or classes of aliens from their territory, and can, in order to make effectual such decree of exclusion or expulsion, devolve the power and duty of identifying and arresting the persons included in such decree, and causing their deportation, upon executive or subordinate officials.\n\n'But when Congress sees fit tofurther promote such a policy by subjecting the persons of such aliens to infamous punishment at hard labor, or by confiscating their property, we think such legislation, to be valid, must provide for a judicial trial to establish the guilt of the accused. No limits can be put by the courts upon the power of Congress to protect, by summary methods, the country from the advent of aliens whose race or habits render them undesirable as citizens, or to expel such if they have already found their way into our land, and unlawfully remain therein. But to declare unlawful residence within the country to be an infamous crime, punishable by deprivation of liberty and property, would be to pass out of the sphere of constitutional legislation, unless provision were made that the fact of guilt should first be established by a judicial trial. It is not consistent with the theory of our government that the legislature should, after having defined an offense as an infamous crime, find the fact of guilt, and adjudge the punishment, by one of itsown agents.'\n\n Detention or temporary confinement as part of themeans necessary to give effect to the exclusion or expulsion was held valid, but so much of the act of 1892 [27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1319] as provided for imprisonment at hard labor without a judicial trial was held to be unconstitutional. The cases of Chae Chan Ping, Fong Yue Ting and Lem Moon Sing werecarefully considered and applied.\n We do not feel called upon toreconsider these decisions, and they dispose of the specific contentions as to the application of the 5th and 6th Amendments, and  1 of article 3, and the denial of the delegation to the general government of \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 292]\n\u00a0\n the power to enact this law. But it is said that the act violates the 1st Amendment, which prohibits the passage of any law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assembly, and to petition thegovernment for a redress of grievances.'\n We are at a loss tounderstand in what way the act is obnoxious to this objection. It has no reference to an establishment of religion, nor does it prohibit the free exercise thereof; nor abridge the freedom of speech or of the press; nor the right of the people to assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances. It is, of course, true, that if an alien is not permitted to enter this country, or, having entered contrary to law, is expelled, he is in fact cut off from worshipping or speaking or publishing or petitioning in the country; but that is merely because of his exclusion therefrom. He does not become one of the people to whom these things are secured by our Constitution by an attempt to enter, forbidden by law. To appeal to the Constitution is to concede that this is a land governed by that supreme law, and as under it the power to exclude has been determined to exist, those who are excluded cannot assert the rights in general obtaining in a land towhich they do not belong as citizens or otherwise.\n Appellant'scontention really comes to this: that the act is unconstitutional so far as it provides for the exclusion of an alien because he is ananarchist.\n The argument seems to be that, conceding that Congresshas the power to shut out any alien, the power, nevertheless, does not extend to some aliens, and that if the act includes all alien anarchists, it is unconstitutional, because some anarchists are merely political philosophers, whose teachings are beneficial rather thanotherwise.\n Counsel give these definitions from the Centurydictionary:\n'ANARCHY. Absence or insufficiency of government; astate of society in which there is no capable supreme power, and in which the several functions of the state are performed badly or \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 293]\n\u00a0\n not at all; social and political confusion. Specifically-2. A social theory which regards the union of order with the absence of all direct government of man by man as the politicalideal; absolute individual liberty. 3. Confusion in general.\n\n'ANARCHIST. 1. Properly, one who advocates anarchy or the absence of government as a political ideal; a believer in an anarchic theory of society; especially, an adherent of the social theory of Proudhon. See Anarchy, 2. 2. In popular use, one who seeks to overturn by violence all constituted forms and institutions of society and government, all law and order, and all rights of property, with no purpose of establishing any other system of order in the place of that destroyed; especially, such a person when actuated by mere lust of plunder. 3. Any person who promotes disorder or excites revolt againstan established rule, law, or custom.'\n\n And Huxley is quoted assaying: 'Anarchy, as a term of political philosophy, must be taken only in its proper sense, which has nothing to do with disorder or with crime, but denotes a state of society in which the rule of each individual by himself is the only government the legitimacy of which isrecognized.'\n The language of the act is 'anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States or of all government or of all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials.' If this should be construed as defining the word 'anarchists' by the words which follow, or as used in the popular sense above given, it would seem that when an alien arrives in this country, who avows himself to be an anarchist, without more, he accepts the definition. And we suppose counsel does not deny that this government has the power to exclude an alien who believes in or advocates the overthrow of the government or of all governments by force or the assassination of officials. To put thatquestion is to answer it.\n And if the judgment of the board and the Secretary was that Turner came within the act as thus construed, we can- \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 294]\n\u00a0\n not hold, as matter of law, that there was no evidence on which that conclusion could be rested. Even if Turner, though he did not so state to the board, only regarded the absence of government as a political ideal, yet when he sought to attain it by advocating, not simply for the benefit of workingmen, who are justly entitled to repel the charge of desiring the destruction of law and order, but 'at any rate, as an anarchist,' the universal strike to which he referred, and by discourses on what he called 'The Legal Murder of 1887' (Spies v. People, 122 Ill. 1, 3 Am. St. Rep. 320, 12 N. E. 865, 17 N. E. 898), and by addressing mass meetings on that subject in association with Most (Queen v. Most, L. R. 7 Q. B. Div. 244; People v. Most, 171 N. Y. 423, 58 L. R. A. 509, 64 N. E. 175), we cannot say that the inference was unjustifiable either that he contemplated the ultimate realization of his ideal by the use of force, or that his speeches wereincitements to that end.\n If the word 'anarchists' should beinterpreted as including aliens whose anarchistic views are professed as those of political philosophers, innocent of evil intent, it would follow that Congress was of opinion that the tendency of the general exploitation of such views is so dangerous to the public weal that aliens who hold and advocate them would be undesirable additions to our population, whether permanently or temporarily, whether many or few; and, in the light of previous decisions, the act, even in this aspect, would not be unconstitutional, as applicable to any alien who is opposedto all organized government.\n We are not to be understood asdepreciating the vital importance of freedom of speech and of the press, or as suggesting limitations on the spirit of liberty, in itself unconquerable, but this case does not involve those considerations. The flaming brand which guards the realm where no human government is needed still bars the entrance; and as lone as human governments endure they cannot be denied the power of self-preservation, as that question ispresented here.\n Reference was made by counsel to the alien law ofJune 25, 1798 (1 Stat. at L. 570, chap. 58), but we do not think that the con- \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 295]\n\u00a0\n troversy over that law (and the sedition law) and the opinions expressed at the time against its constitutionality have any bearing upon this case, which involves an act couched in entirely different terms, and embracing an entirely different purpose. As Mr. Justice Field remarked in the Chinese Exclusion Case, \n130 U.S. 610\n, 32 L. ed. 1077, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632: 'The act was passed during a period of great political excitement, and it was attacked and defended with great zeal and ability. It is enough, however, to say that it is entirely different from the act before us, and the validity of its provisions was never brought to the test of judicial decision in the courts of the United States.' Order affirmed.\n\n Separate opinion by Brewer, j.:\n In viewof the range of discussion in the argument of this case at the bar, I feel justified in adding a few words to what has been said by the ChiefJustice.\n First. I fully indorse and accentuate the conclusions ofthe court, as disclosed by the opinion, that, notwithstanding the legislation of Congress, the courts may and must, when properly called upon by petition in habeas corpus examine and determine the right of any individual restrained of his personal liberty to be discharged from such restraint. I do not believe it within the power of Congress to give to ministerial officers of final adjudication of the right to liberty, or to oust the courts from the duty of inquiry respecting both law and facts. 'The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.' Const. art. 1,  9, clause 2.\n Second. While undoubtedly the United States as a nation has all the powers which inhere in any nation, Congress is not authorized in all things to act for the nation, and too little effect has been given to the 10th article of the amendments to the Constitution, that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \n\n[194 U.S. 279, 296]\n\u00a0\n states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.' The powers the people have given to the general government are named in the Constitution, and all not there named, either expressly or by implication, are reserved to the people, and can be exercised only by them, or upon further grant from them.\n Third. No testimony was offered on the hearing before the circuit court other than that taken before the immigration board of inquiry, and none before such board save that preserved in its report. Hence, the facts must be determined by that evidence. It is not an unreasonable deduction therefrom that petitioner is an anarchist in the commonly accepted sense of the term,-one who urges and seeks the overthrow by force of all government. If that be not the fact, he should have introduced testimony to establish the contrary. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider what rights he would have if he were only what is called, by way of differentiation, a philosophical anarchist,-one who simply entertains and expresses the opinion that all government is a mistake, and that society would be better off without any. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.

Russell for the United States.\n Messrs. John F. Dillon, Aldis B. Browne, and Alexander Britton for the California & Oregon Land Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are cross appeals from a decree of the United States circuit court. The bill was brought for the purpose of having certain patents of land issued by the United States declared void. These patents were issued on April 2, 1873, to the Oregon Central Military Road Company, under an act of Congress of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 355, chap. 213), granting lands to the state of Oregon to aid in the construction of a wagon road, and in pursuance of \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n a grant of the same lands by the state to the road company on October 24, 1864. The California & Oregon Land Company claims through mesne conveyances from the patentee. The ground of the bill, so far as the argument before us is concerned, is that the lands in controversy were within the Klamath Indian Reservation, and therefore were 'lands heretofore reserved to the United States' within the proviso reserving such lands in the grant of July 2, 1864. As our decision is upon grounds independent of this question, it is unnecessary to state the legislation and facts upon which that controversy turns.\n One of the pleas of the land company is that on August 30, 1889, the United States filed an earlier bill in the United States circuit court in respect of these same lands, praying, like the present one, that the patents be declared void; that the land company pleaded matters showing that the patents were valid, and also that it was a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice; and that on March 29, 1893, a final decree was entered, finding the facts to be as alleged by the land company, including the allegation that the land company was a bona fide purchaser for value, and dismissing the bill on that ground. The land company also filed a cross bill in the present suit to enjoin the allotments of said lands and the issue of patents for the same to the Indians. The cross bill was demurred to.\n The circuit court sustained the demurrer, adjudged the plea to be bad, and entered a decree declaring the patents void. We have to deal only with the before-mentioned plea.\n The former bill was brought in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 850, chap. 377). This act recited that the Oregon legislature had memorialized Congress, and had alleged that certain of the wagon roads in the state were not completed within the time required by the grants of the United States, and therefore enacted that suits should be brought in the United States circuit court against all claimants of any interest under the grant of 1864, and certain others, 'to determine the questions of the seasonable and proper completion of said roads in accordance with the terms of the granting \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n acts. . . . The legal effect of the several certificates of the governors of the state of Oregon of the completion of said roads, and the right of resumption of such granted lands by the United States.' The court was authorized to render judgment of forfeiture 'saving and preserving the rights of all bona fide purchasers of either of said grants or of any portion of said grants for a valuable consideration, if any such there be. Said suit or suits shall be tried and adjudicated in like manner and by the same principles and rules of jurisprudence as other suits in equity are therein tried.' The act of March 2, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39), 1 also confirmed the title of bona fide purchasers.\n By  2, 'the state of Oregon, and any person or corporation claiming any interest under or through the grants aforesaid in the lands to be affected by said suit or suits, and whether made a party thereto or not, may intervene therein by sworn petition to defend his interest therein, as against the United States, or against each other, and affecting the said question of forfeiture, and may, upon such petition for intervention, also put in issue and have adjudicated and determined any other question, whether of law or of fact, which may be in dispute between said intervener and the United States, and affecting the right or title to any part of the lands claimed to have been embraced within the grants. . . . Should the lands embraced within said grants or either of them, or any portion thereof, be declared forfeited by the final determination of said suit or suits, the same shall be immediately restored to the public domain, and become subject to disposal under the general land laws; and should the final determination of said suit or suits maintain the right of the aforesaid wagon-road grantees or their assigns to the lands embraced in said grants, the Secretary of the Interior shall forthwith adjust said grants in accordance with such determination, and shall cause patents to be issued for the lands inuring to said grantees under said wagon-road grants and which have been heretofore unpatented.'\n On the general principles of our law it is tolerably plain that the decree in the suit under the foregoing statute would \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n be a bar. The parties, the subject-matter, and the relief sought all were the same. It is said, to be sure, that the United States now is suing in a different character from that in which it brought the former suit. There it sued for itself,-here it sues on behalf of the Indians. But that is not true in any sense having legal significance. It would be true of a suit by an executor as compared with a suit by the same person on his own behalf. But that is because in theory of law the executor continues the persona of the testator, and therefore is a different person from the natural man who fills the office. This is recognized in Leggott v. Great Northern R. Co. L. R. 1 Q. B. Div. 599, 606, cited for the United States. Here the plaintiff is the same person that brought the former bill, whatever the difference of the interest intended to be asserted. See Werlein v. New Orleans, \n177 \nU.S. 390, 400\n, 401 S., 44 L. ed. 817, 822, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682. The best that can be said, apart from the act just quoted, to distinguish the two suits, is that now the United States puts forward a new ground for its prayer. Formerly it sought to avoid the patents by way of forfeiture. Now it seeks the same conclusion by a different means,-that is to say, by evidence that the lands originally were excepted from the grant. But in this as in the former suit, it seeks to establish its own title to the fee.\n It may be the law in Scotland that a judgment is not a bar to a second attempt to reach the same result by a different medium concludendi. Phosphate Sewage Co. v. Molleson, 5 Ct. Sess. Cas. 4th Series, 1125, 1139; although in the same case on appeal Lord Blackburn seemed to doubt the proposition if the facts were known before. S. C. L. R. 4 App. Cas. 801, 820. But the whole tendency of our decisions is to require a plaintiff to try his whole cause of action and his whole case at one time. He cannot even split up his claim (Fetter v. Beale, 1 Salk. 11; Trask v. Hartford & N. H. R. Co. 2 Allen, 331; Freeman, Judgm. 4th ed.  238, 241); and, a fortiori, he cannot divide the grounds of recovery. Unless the statute of 1889 put the former suit upon a peculiar footing, the United States was bound then to bring forward all the grounds it had for declaring the patents void, and when the bill was dismissed, was barred as to all by the decree. Werlein v. New Orleans, \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n \n177 U.S. 390\n, 44 L. ed. 817, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682; Bienville Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 216\n, 217 S., 46 L. ed. 1132, 1134, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 820; Hoseason v. Keegen, 178 Mass. 247, 59 N. E. 627; Wildman v. Wildman, 70 Conn. 700, 710, 41 Atl. 1; Sayers v. Auditor General, 124 Mich. 259, 82 N. W. 1045; Foster v. Hinson, 76 Iowa, 714, 720, 39 N. W. 682; State v. Brown, 64 Md. 199, 1 Atl. 54, 6 Atl. 172; Boyd v. Boyd, 53 App. Div. 152, 159, 65 N. Y. Supp. 859; Shaffer v. Scuddy, 14 La. Ann. 576; Henderson v. Henderson, 3 Hare, 100, 115.\n The question, then, is narrowed to whether the statute established a special and peculiar rule of procedure for the cases to be brought under it. No doubt it is true that the ground of recovery that was prominent in the mind of Congress was an alleged forfeiture of the grant, and therefore not unnaturally, in  2, the result of a forfeiture is stated. But a forfeiture was not the only ground on which the United States might have prevailed. All claimants of any interest were at liberty to intervene and to have any other question affecting the title settled, and if any such other question had been raised and resolved in favor of the United States, of course the same result would have followed. But it cannot be supposed that the United States was not at liberty to raise the same issues which defendants and interveners were given the right to raise. There is no reason for such a discrimination, and its right was admitted at the argument. But if the United States was at liberty to state all its grounds for claiming the land, it was bound to do so on 'the same principles and rules of jurisprudence as other suits in equity are theren tried,' by which principles and rules, as has been shown, it was expressly enacted that the case should be tried. So far from establishing a special rule, the act shows an intent to settle the title once for all. It was dealing with several grants which might present different cases. It stated in terms that the suits should be brought to determine not merely the question of forfeiture, but 'the right of resumption of such granted lands by the United States,'  1, and it provided that if the suits should maintain the right of the wagon-road grantees or their assigns to the lands embraced in said grants, the Secretary of the Interior should adjust the grants in accordance with the determination, and issue patents for the lands to which the grantees \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 360]\n\u00a0\n WERE ENTITLED AND WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PATEnted. see also the language of the act of March 2, 1896,  1 (29 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39). It would not be consistent with the good faith of the United States to attribute to it the intent to keep a concealed weapon in reserve in case these suits should fail. On the face of the act it seems to us apparent that these suits were intended to quiet or to end the title of the wagon-road grantees.\n As the bill must be dismissed there seems to be no reason why the cross bill should not be dismissed, according to the general rule in such cases. Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 20 L. ed. 65. It is true that the cross bill is not merely in aid of the defense, and that relief has been given upon a cross bill in such a case, notwithstanding the dismissal of the bill. Holgate v. Eaton, \n116 \nU.S. 33, 42\n, 29 S. L. ed. 538, 540, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224; Blythe v. Hinckley, 84 Fed. 228, 236, 237. But apart from any other questions it may be presumed that after this decision no action will be attempted based on a denial of the land company's title to the fee.\n Decree reversed and case remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to enter a decree dismissing the bill and cross bill.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting:\n It will be assumed that the lands in controversy had been reserved for the Indians prior to the taking effect of the grant, 'except so far as it may be necessary to locate the route of said road through the same, in which case the right of way is granted.'\n The act of 1866 made provision for supplying deficiencies 'occasioned by any lands sold or reserved, or to which the rights of pre-emption or homestead have attached, or which for any reason were not subject to said grant.' [14 Stat. at L. 374, chap. 5.]\n March 2, 1889, Congress directed the Attorney General to cause a suit or suits to be brought against all persons, firms, and corporations claiming interests in lands granted to the state of Oregon, by three enumerated acts of Congress, including that under consideration: 'To determine the ques- \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n tions of the seasonable and proper completion of said roads in accordance with the terms of the granting acts, either in whole or in part, the legal effect of the several certificates of the governors of the state of Oregon of the completion of said roads, and the right of resumption of such granted lands by the United States, and to obtain judgments, which the court is hereby authorized to render, declaring forfeited to the United States, all of such lands as are coterminous with the part or parts of either of said wagon roads which were not constructed in accordance with requirements of the granting acts, and setting aside patents which have issued for any such lands, saving and preserving the rights of all bona fide purchasers of either of said grants or of any portion of said grants for a valuable consideration, if any such there be.' . . .\n By the second section of the act it was provided that the state or any person or corporation claiming under the grant might intervene and defend his interest therein, and might 'also putin issue and have adjudicated and determined any other question, whether of law or of fact, which may be in dispute between said intervener and the United States, and affecting the right or title to any part of the lands claimed to have been embraced within the grants of lands by the United States to or for either of said wagon roads. Should the lands embraced within said grants or either of them or any portion thereof be declared forfeited by the final determination of said suit or suits, the same shall be immediately restored to the public domain, and become subject to disposal under the general land laws; and should the final determination of said suit or suits maintain the right of the aforesaid wagon road grantees or their assigns to the lands embraced in said grants, the Secretary of the Interior shall forthwith adjust said grants in accordance with such determination,' etc.\n The act related to three wagon-road grants, only one of which was involved in this case. This bill sought a forfeiture of the entire grant for reasons stated, and no other matter was put in issue. The bill covered the lands in the reservation and many thousands of acres besides. It seems to me \n\n[192 U.S. 355, 362]\n\u00a0\n clear that Congress did not intend that the United States should ask a forfeiture and at the same time litigate exceptions from the grant. The second section is wholly inconsistent with such a theory. The issue was a single issue, and defendants did not seek to have it expanded. The suit was decided in favor of defendants (\n148 U.S. 31\n, 37 L. ed. 354, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458), and the present bill having been filed in respect of the lands of the Indian reservation, it is now contended that the former decree is a bar to its prosecution.\n I do not think so. The former case sought a forfeiture of the entire grant. This bill, accepting the conclusion that there could be no forfeiture simply sought relief as to particular lands which had not been embraced in the grant and did not pass thereby, but which had been patented in error. Conceding that Congress may pass title subject to Indian occupancy, it did not do so; but these lands were reserved from the grant, while in terms the right of way through the reservation was granted. Had the decree in the prior case been for the government, this right of way would have been declared forfeited with other lands included in the grant, but as the case turned out the right of way passed while the reservation remained unaffected. The cause of action in this suit is entirely different and governed by entirely different considerations from the cause of action in the prior suit. And I think the decree in the former suit operates as an estoppel only as to the point or question actually litigated and determined.\n There is no hardship involved in this view, as while the United States were shut up to the question of forfeitures, defendants were permitted to raise any questions they chose, and did not see fit to bring any other into the case.\n My brothers Harlan and Brown concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

CO.(1904)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The United States, on the 6th day of March, 1893, filed this bill in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota, for the purpose of setting aside the certification, under the land grant of Congress (14 Stat. at L. 87, chap. 168), made by the Secretary of the Interior, of the land described in the bill, to the state of Minnesota, for the benefit of the railroad company, and also to set aside the conveyance thereof by the state to the railroad company, and by the company to one of the individual defendants. A supplemental bill was filed, by leave, March 4, 1901, bringing in by service of the subpoena other individual defendants.\n The suit was brought under and pursuant to the act of Congress of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595), entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Adjustment of Land Grants made by Congress \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 525]\n\u00a0\n to Aid in the Construction of Railroads, and for the Forfeiture of Unearned Lands, and for Other Purposes.'\n Upon trial in the circuit court the bill was dismissed, and the decree of dismissal was affirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit (54 C. C. A. 545, 116 Fed. 969), and from that decree of affirmance the government has appealed here.\n The facts upon which the controversy arose are, in substance, as follows: On the 4th day of July, 1866, Congress passed an act making an additional grant of lands to the state of Minnesota (14 Stat. at L. 87, chap. 168), to aid in the construction of railroads in that state. The Southern Minnesota Railroad Company was, at the time of the passage of the act of Congress, a corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota, with the power to construct a line of railroad, as mentioned in that act. The legislature of Minnesota, on the 25th day of February, 1867, transferred the land granted to it by the act of Congress to the railroad company, subject to the provisions of that act and also of the state statute.\n Among the lands thus transferred was a lot 80 acres in extent, in Faribault county, Minnesota, being the property in dispute in this suit. The land was within the indemnity limits of the grant by Congress to the state, as determined by the map of definite location of the railroad, which became effective February 25, 1867. The deficiency in what are termed the 'place' lands was largely in excess of 80 acres. On the 29th day of November, 1870, the Southern Minnesota Railroad Company selected this tract, in section 35, in lieu of part of the land lost in the granted limits; and the land was certified to the state of Minnesota by the Secretary of the Interior, March 25, 1871, for the benefit of the railroad company; and on the 8th day of August, 1871, the state of Minnesota conveyed it by deed to the railroad company. In March, 1868, the company had mortgaged all of its property, including the land granted under the act of Congress and all subsequently acquired property, to secure \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 526]\n\u00a0\n the payment of its bonds. This mortgage was foreclosed, and the property sold and conveyed to a new corporation by the name of the Southern Minnesota Railway Company, and the land was conveyed to that company. On the 5th day of January, 1885, the railway company, by contract in writing, agreed to sell the land in dispute to one A. Boyeson, for the sum named in that contract. Boyeson assigned his interest in the contract, on the 6th of January, to Fredericksen, who, on the 1st day of April, 1885, assigned it to the defendant, Thomas S. Thompson, and, in turn, on the 3d day of February, 1888, the latter assigned it to Ericksrud, who paid the balance due upon the contract, and received the warranty deed for the land from the railway company on the 20th day of March, 1888\n\n\n Ericksrud died intestate on March 27, 1888, and on November 6, 1888, the land was decreed by the probate court to be the property of the widow and heirs at law of Ericksrud, and they remained in possession, and, on the 24th of May, 1899, these heirs at law, still being in possession, conveyed the same to the defendant Woodwick for the sum of $2,000 cash. This is the title of record coming from the United States to the state, thence to the railroad company, and, by mesne conveyances, to the defendant Woodwick; and there was nothing of record showing that any other person was entitled to the land at the time when Woodwick paid the $2,000 to the heirs of Ericksrud, and took the deed therefor. The defendant Donovan, however, lays claim to the land in question pursuant to the facts now to be stated.\n Prior to the passage of the granting act of Congress, above referred to, one Luman Barclay had, on the 21st day of June, 1866, entered this land in controversy, and also the 80 acres in section 26, adjoining, as a homestead. In the following year (1867) Barclay abandoned the land and went to Canada. Some time after his departure, and in the same year (1867), Donovan, the defendant, sought to acquire a homestead on government land. He examined the land for \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n which Barclay had made his entry, and decided to enter it as a homestead. He went to the United States local land office for the purpose, and was informed by the register of the land office that he could not make the entry until Barclay's entry was canceled. He was also informed that, if he wished to make a claim that Barclay had abandoned his interest, he should publish notice of the time and place where he would make proof upon that matter. He published a notice accordingly, for three weeks, and paid $9 as the cost thereof, and, in the fore part of August, 1867, made proof that Barclay had abandoned his homestead claim. Donovan insists that he was given to understand that he could enter the land as a homestead as soon as the local land office received notice from the General Land Office, at Washington, that Barclay's entry was canceled. He thereupon made one application to enter both tracts of land,-the 80 acres in section 26, and the 80-acre tract in question in section 35, but left the date of application blank, because he could make no entry for the lot in section 35 until Barclay's entry had been canceled. He did this, as he or his witness Bullis said, to head off any other applicant for the land, and he left the application with the local land office. He then went into possession of section 26, and commenced the erection of a house thereon; and he says he commenced the cultivation of a small part of the tract in section 35. This was in the fall of 1867. The Barclay entry was duly canceled at Washington on the 14th of Junuary, 1868, and notice thereafter given to the local land office, and Donovan was notified of the fact. On the 6th day of June, 1868, Donovan went to the local land office, and applied to enter the two tracts of land. He was there informed that the odd-numbered sections within 20 miles of the road had been withdrawn from market; and that such withdrawal included the section in question; and that he could not, therefore, enter the 80 acres in section 36 as a part of his homestead.\n Donovan acquiesced in this determination of the local land \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n office, and made his entry for the 80 acres in section 26. The old application for the two lots was destroyed, and a new one made out for the lot in section 26. He thereafter used the land in section 35, in connection with his own in section 26, and cut grass upon and ploughed some of it; but it does not appear that he laid any claim to it as land which he had attempted to enter, and which had been improperly or wrongfully refused him. His house and other permanent improvements were on section 26. At the time he made proof (in 1875) for the 80 acres in section 26, Donovan says he offered to make proof also as to the land in section 35, but his offer was rejected because, among other reasons, he had not entered the land in that section. He has obtained his patent for the 80 acres in section 26.\n On the 26th day of June, 1883, Donovan applied at the local land office to enter this tract of land in section 35 as an additional homestead, under the act of March 3, 1879 (20 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 191, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1401); and the register certified that the application was for surveyed lands of the class the applicant was legally entitled to enter under the homestead act of 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 392, chap. 75]; in other words, unappropriated public lands of the United States. The application was rejected upon the ground that the land so applied for had been certified to the state of Minnesota, for the benefit of the railroad company. Donovan appealed from this rejection to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, where, it is stated, the matter is still pending and undetermined.\n In 1885 the defendant Thompson, an assignee of the contract made by the railway company with Boyeson, went into possession of the 80 acres in section 35, and ordered Donovan off the same, and Donovan left the land accordingly. After Thompson took possession of the land,-April 1, 1885,- Donovan, in the same year, commenced a suit in the district court of Faribault county to obtain possession of the land; and, on or about the 24th of March, 1887, the state court decided that Donovan had no title to the land, or \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n right to the possession of the same, and that Thompson had the right to the possession thereof under the contract already mentioned. This judgment against him in the state court was never appealed from by Donovan, nor has it ever been vacated, modified, or reversed. In 1888 Donovan applied to the Land Department at Washington for relief, by reason of the act of Congress of March 3, 1887, heretofore referred to. In relation to that application the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on February 14, 1889, addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, and therein spoke of Donovan's application for the institution of proceedings under that act of Congress, and said that Donovan had no title to the land; but he sent all the papers to the Secretary, for review by him. On the 1st of April, 1889, the Secretary replied to the communication of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and therein reversed his holding, and directed the latter to make a demand of the railway company for the reconveyance of the land, as provided for in the act. On the 12th of April, 1890, the Commissioner sent a communication to the Secretary, informing him that a demand for the reconveyance of the land had been made April 9, 1889, upon the railroad company, and that no answer had been made, although more than a year had elapsed since the demand. On the 16th of April, 1890, the Secretary of the Interior transmitted the letter to the Attorney General, with a request that suit might be instituted to have the certification of the land in question by the Land Department to the state of Minnesota set aside and canceled if, in the opinion of the Attorney General, the suit could be maintained. After waiting three years, and on the 6th of March, 1893, the United States filed its bill against the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company as successor in interest of the former companies, and also against the Southern Minnesota Railway Company, Michael Donovan, Thomas S. Thompson, and C. C. Ericksrud. On August 11, 1894, the companies answered the bill. Donovan did not answer it until March 6, 1901, and then confessed the same, \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n and prayed that the relief asked for might be granted. On March 4, 1901, the United States filed a supplemental bill, wherein it was stated that no service had ever been made upon Thompson or Ericksrud, and that, on May 24, 1899, the heirs of Ericksrud had joined in a deed conveying the land in question to Louis K. Woodwick. Process was prayed against the defendants, the heirs of Ericksrud, and also against Woodwick, and subpoenas were served on them, and on May 2, 1901, they answered the supplemental bill. A special examiner was appointed to take testimony; and on the 13th of January, 1902, he submitted his report of the testimony taken in the suit, to the court.\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for appellant.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 524, 533]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Burton Hanson, W. H. Norris, and Andrew C. Dunn for appellees.\n\n\n\n[195 U.S. 524, 534]\n\u00a0\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Attorney General contends that, before the passage of the act of Congress granting the land (July 4, 1866), Barclay had made legal entry upon the books of the local land office, of the land in question, under the homestead laws of Congress, and that such legal entry was in existence at the time of the passage of the act of Congress of July 4, 1866; that, by reason of such entry, the land was excepted from the grant under that act, and that when Barclay abandoned his homestead claim upon the land, it immediately became public land of the United States, and did not then pass under the grant to the state pursuant to the act of July 4, 1866, and it was \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 535]\n\u00a0\n therefore not legally withdrawn from market by any act of the Land Department, nor could it be certified to the state; and that the attempt to do so was not only erroneous, but absolutely void; that, at the Time when Donovan made application to enter the land, in June, 1868, it was part of the public lands of the United States, open to entry, and his application, although he had done all that he could, was wrongfully denied by the local land office; that thereafter the filing of the map of definite location by the railway company, and its selection of the land in question, and the certification of the land by the Secretary of the Interior to the state, and the conveyance by the state to the railway company, and the contract and conveyances following thereon,-conveyed no interest in or title to the premises in question, but that they rightfully belonged to Donovan, and therefore the certification by the Land Department, etc., should be set aside, to the end that the land may be transferred to Donovan, as demanded in the bill.\n On the other hand, it is insisted on the part of the defendant Woodwick, that the action of the Land Department officials in withdrawing the land in question from market was valid, and within the jurisdiction of that department; that the selection of the land by the railway company was proper, as being within the indemnity limits of the grant by Congress; and that its certification by the Secretary of the Interior to the state was within the power of that officer, and the act was not, therefore, beyond his jurisdiction; and that his certification and the action of the state conveyed a good title, or, at any rate, that the defendant Woodwick was a bona fide purchaser of the land, and as such his rights were preserved under the act of March 3, 1887. 24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595.\n If Woodwick is protected under that act, as a purchaser in good faith, even against Donovan, it is unnecessary to pursue an inquiry as to the existence of any other defense. We are of opinion that Woodwick is protected under the 4th section of the act. The plain intent of that section \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 536]\n\u00a0\n is, as stated by Mr. Justice Brewer in delivering the opinion of the court, in United States v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n165 U.S. 463\n, 41 L. ed. 789, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368, to secure one who, in good faith and as an honest transaction, purchases the land, and to leave to the government a simple claim for money against the railroad. The justice said (pp. 480, 481, L. ed. p. 796, 797, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 372):\n'It will be observed that the technical term 'bona fide purchaser' is not found in this section, and while it is provided that a mortgage or pledge shall not be considered a sale so as to entitle the mortgagee or pledgee to the benefit of the act, it does secure to every one who, in good faith, has made an absolute purchase from a railroad company, protection to his title, irrespective of any errors or mistakes in the certification or patent.\n\n'. . . These being the provisions of the act of 1887, the act of 1896 ( 29 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1603), confirming the right and title of a bona fide purchaser, and providing that the patents to his lands should not be vacated or annulled, must be held to include one who, if not in the fullest sense a 'bona fide purchaser,' has nevertheless purchased in good faith from the railroad company.'\n\n The counsel for the government, while strenuously denying that the legal title to this land passed to the state of Minnesota by virtue of the certification, in 1871, admits in his brief that, if Woodwick bought the land as a bona fide purchaser in 1899, and acquired the legal title to the same, then, at that present time, not only was the right of the United States to recover the land defeated, but Donovan was precluded from thereafter asserting his claim to the land, as against such bona fide purchaser. His denial that the legal title passed is based upon the contention that Donovan, before the year 1871, when the Secretary of the Interior certified this land to the state, had, as stated by counsel, initiated proceedings to obtain this land in section 35 as a homestead, and had done all he could to make entry thereof, and had been in possession for three years before this certification; and that \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 537]\n\u00a0\n prior to 1871 an initiatory title had passed from the United States to Donovan, by reason of his possession and offer to enter the land, and his payment of the fees and expenses to the local land officers, so as to prevent the passage of the legal title to the state, by virtue of the certification referred to, which, by reason of the acts of Donovan, was rendered wholly void. It is also asserted that, if the United States, in 1871, did retain title in itself, notwithstanding Donovan's occupation and cultivation of the land, yet such occupation and cultivation withdrew the land from the jurisdiction of the Land Department, so far as any right or power to issue a certification to the railroad company was concerned, just as effectually as though the land had been reserved or otherwise appropriated specifically by an act of Congress.\n We think that, in 1871, when the certification was made, jurisdiction over this land remained in the Land Department, to be exercised by the Secretary of the Interior, notwithstanding the acts of Donovan as shown by this record. It is shown by the testimony of Donovan himself and of his witness Bullis, putting it all together, that there never was, in fact, any entry of this land at the local land office, in the name of Donovan, before the certification in 1871. The facts as to what took place in that office, in regard to the applications of Donovan in 1867, before the Barclay entry was canceled, and in June, 1868, when the entry was made for the lot in section 26, are set forth in the statement of facts herein, and need not be repeated. The statement shows no such facts as put Donovan in the place of one who, having done all he could to enter the land, had been refused such entry, but had nevertheless not acquiesced in such decision, and had taken possession of it as a homestead. On the contrary, Donovan did acquiesce in that decision, and amended his application.\n There was no entry made on the books of the local land office for this land, under the amended application, and the power of the Secretary of the Interior to make the certification, even if we assume that it was erroneously exercised, \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 538]\n\u00a0\n was not an act which was beyond the jurisdiction of the Secretary. The legal title was thus transferred by the government to the state, and, at the most, it was an erroneous certification within the meaning of the act of 1887. Although under such circumstances, if the certification were erroneous and might have been avoided, and the land recovered back by the government while in the hands of the railroad company, yet, Woodwick, if a purchaser in good faith of the lands, was entitled to them under the provisions of the act. He had no notice, actual or constructive, of the claim of the government in regard to this land. The record title was plain. No suit had been commenced when Ericksrud took his title from the government, and went into possession thereunder. He died within a week thereafter, and his heirs thereupon took possession. They were in possession when the government commenced this suit, in 1893, but were never served with process therein until 1901; which was two years after Woodwick had purchased the property from them, and had in good faith paid them the sum of $2,000 in cash for the land.\n Counsel for the government admits that it is futile to maintain that Woodwick had constructive notice of the defects in his title by reason of the pendency of this suit, which had been commenced by the government in 1893, but in which the railroad companies alone had been served with process.\n Whatever equities Donovan may have had as against the government, by virtue of his so-called attempt to make entry for the 80 acres in section 35, they do not override the plain provisions of the statute of 1887, and also that of 1896 (26 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1603), which save the rights of one who purchased from the railroad in good faith.\n As was observed by Mr. Justice Brewer, in the case already referred to (United States v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n165 U.S. 480\n, 41 L. ed. 796, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372); 'It matters not what constructive notice may be chargeable to such a purchaser, if, in actual ignorance of any defect in the railroad company's title, and in reliance upon \n\n[195 U.S. 524, 539]\n\u00a0\n the action of the government in the apparent transfer of title by certification or patent, he has made an honest purchase of the lands.'\n Donovan is not brought within the case of Winona & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, immediately following the above-cited case, at page 483 (L. ed. p. 798, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 381), because, among other facts, it appears herein that there was no record of any entry in Donovan's case for this land, on the books of the local land office, and it is conceded that he had been out of any possession of the land since 1885. The above-cited case is not, therefore, in point. The same may be said of Duluth & I. Range R. Co. v. Roy, \n173 U.S. 587\n, 43 L. ed. 820, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 549, and Oregon & C. R. Co. v. United States, \n189 U.S. 103\n-116, 47 L. ed. 726- 732, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 615.\n Donovan cannot be regarded as having by his action secured a vested interest in this land, so as to make the certification to the state a wholly void act, as an act beyond the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Assuming that it may have been erroneous and voidable, it was not void. We do not decide it was erroneous. In 1871 the legal title, still remaining in the government, was transferred to the state by the certification of the Secretary, and, as we have said, Woodwick occupied the position of a purchaser in good faith under the acts of Congress.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

The case is a libel in rem against a British vessel for the destruction of a beacon,-Number 7, Mobile ship- channel lights,-caused by the alleged negligent running into the beacon by the vessel. The beacon stood 15 or 20 feet from the channel of Mobile river or bay, in water 12 or 15 feet deep, and was built on piles driven firmly into the bottom. There is no question that it was attached to the realty, and that it was a part of it by the ordinary criteria of the common law. On this ground the district court declined jurisdiction, and dismissed the libel. The Blackheath, 122 Fed. 112.\n In The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, sub nom. Hough v. Western Transp. Co. 18 L. ed. 125, where a libel was brought by the owners of a wharf burned by a fire negligently started on a vessel, the jurisdiction was denied by this court. See also Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co. \n118 U.S. 610\n, 30 L. ed. 274, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. In two later cases there are dicta denying the jurisdiction equally when a building on shore is damaged by a vessel running into it. Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 U.S. 388\n, 30 L. ed. 447, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254; Homer Ramsdell Transp. Co. v. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, \n182 \nU.S. 406, 411\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1155, 1159, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831. And there are a number of decisions of district and other courts since The Plymouth, which more or less accord with the conclusion of the court below. See note to Campbell v. H. Hackfeld & Co. 62 C. C. A. 287-290. It would be simple, if simplicity were the only thing to be considered, to confine the admiralty jurisdiction, in respect of damage to property, to damage done to property afloat. That distinction sounds like a logical consequence of the rule determining the admiralty cognizance of torts by place.\n On the other hand, it would be a strong thing to say that Congress has no constitutional power to give the admiralty \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n here as broad a jurisdiction as it has in England or France. Or, if that is in some degree precluded, it ought at least to be possible for Congress to authorize the admiralty to give redress for damage by a ship, in a case like this, to instruments and aids of navigation prepared and owned by the government. But Congress cannot enlarge the constitutional grant of power, and therefore if it could permit a libel to be maintained, one can be maintained now. We are called on by the appellees to say that the remedy for any case of damage to a fixture is outside the constitutional grant.\n The precise scope of admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter of obvious principle or of very accurate history. As to principle, it is clear that if the beacon had been in fault, and had hurt the ship, a libel could have been maintained against a private owner, although not in rem. Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v. Philadelphia & H. de G. Steam Towboat Co. 23 How. 209, 16 L. ed. 433; Atlee v. Northwestern Union Packet Co. 21 Wall. 389, 22 L. ed. 619; Panama R. Co. v. Napier Shipping Co. \n166 U.S. 280\n, 41 L. ed. 1004, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572. Compare The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 18 L. ed. 753. But, as has been suggested, there seems to be no reason why the fact that the injured property was afloat should have more weight in determining the jurisdiction than the fact that the cause of the injury was. The Arkansas, 5 McCrary, 364, 17 Fed. 383, 387; The F. & P. M. No. 2, 33 Fed. 511, 515; Hughes, Admiralty, 183. And again, it seems more arbitrary than rational to treat attachment to the soil as a peremptory bar, outweighing the considerations that the injured thing was an instrument of navigation, and no part of the shore, but surrounded on every side by water, a mere point projecting from the sea.\n As to history, while, as it is well known, the admiralty jurisdiction of this country has not been limited by the local traditions of England ( The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 574, 22 L. ed. 654, 661), the traditions of England favor it in a case like this. The admiral's authority was not excluded by attachment even to the main shore. From before the time of Rowghton's Articles he could hold inquest over nuisances there to naviga- \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 366]\n\u00a0\n tion, and order their abatement. 1 Black Book (Twiss) 224, art. 7; Clerke, Praxis; 1 Select Pleas in Adm., 6 Seld.

Coke mentions that 'of latter times by the letters patents granted to the lord admiral he hath power to erect beacons, seamarks and signs for the sea, etc.' 4 Co. Inst. 148, 149. To the French admiral, it is expressly stated, belonged 'contraincte et pugnicion, tant en criminel que en civil,' in this matter. 1 Black Book, 445, 446. See Crosse v. Diggs, 1 Sid. 158. Spelman says: 'The place absolutely subject to the jurisdiction of the admiraltie, is the sea, which seemeth to comprehend publick rivers, fresh waters, creekes, and surrounded places whatsoever within the ebbing and flowing of the sea at the highest water.' Eng. Works, 2d ed. 226. Finally, by the articles of February 18, 1633, all the judges of England agreed that the admiralty jurisdiction extended to 'injuries there which concern navigation upon the sea.' Exton, Maritime Dicaeology, ad fin., pp. 262, 263. And 'if the libel be founded upon one single continued act, which was principally upon the sea, though part was upon land, a prohibition will not go.' Comyns's Digest, Admiralty, F. 5; 1 Rolle, Abr. 533, pl. 18.\n What the early law seems most to have looked to as fixing the liability of the ship was the motion of the vessel, which was treated as giving it the character of a responsible cause. Bracton recognizes this as an extravagance, but admits the fact, for the common law. 122a, 136b. 1 Select Pleas of the Crown, 1 Seld. Soc. Pub. 84. The same was true in admiralty.

The responsibility of the moving cause took the form of deodand when it occasioned death, like the steam engine in Queen v. Eastern Counties R. Co. 10 Mees. & W. 59, and innum- \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 367]\n\u00a0\n erable early instances, but it was not confined to such cases. 2 Black Book (Twiss) 379. But compare 1 Select Pleas in Adm., 6 Seld. Soc. Publ. lxxi., lxxii. The principle has remained until the present day. United States v. The Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 234, 11 L. ed. 239, 249; The China, 7 Wall. 53, 19 L. ed. 67.\n The foregoing references seem to us enough to show that to maintain jurisdiction in this case is no innovation even upon the old English law. But a very little history is sufficient to justify the conclusion that the Constitution does not prohibit what convenience and reason demand.\n In the case of The Plymouth there was nothing maritime in the nature of the tort for which the vessel was attached. The fact that the fire originated on a vessel gave no character to the result, and that circumstance is mentioned in the judgment of the court, and is contrasted with collision, although the consideration is not adhered to as the sole ground for the decree. It has been given weight in other cases. Campbell v. H. Hackfeld & Co. 62 C. C. A. 274, 125 Fed. 696; Queen v. London Court Judge \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 1892]\n\u00a0\n 1 Q. B. 273, 294; Benedict, Admiralty, 3d ed.  308. Moreover, the damage was done wholly upon the mainland. It never has been decided that every fixture in the midst of the sea was governed by the same rule. The contrary has been supposed in some American cases (The Arkansas, 5 McCrary, 364, 17 Fed. 383, 387; The F. & P. M. No. 2, 33 Fed. 511, 515), and is indicated by the English books cited above. It is unnecessary to determine the relative weight of the different elements of distinction between The Plymouth and the case at bar. It is enough to say that we now are dealing with an injury to a government aid to navigation from ancient times subject to the admiralty,-a beacon emerging from the water,-injured by the motion of the vessel, by a continuous act, beginning and consummated upon navigable water, and giving character to the effects upon a point which is only technically land, through a connection at the bottom of the sea. In such a case jurisdiction may be taken without transcending the limits of the Constitution or encountering \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 368]\n\u00a0\n The Plymouth or any other authority binding on this court. As to the present English law, see The Uhla, L. R. 2 Adm. & Eccl. 29, note; The Swift \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 1901]\n\u00a0\n P. 168.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brown, concurring:\n I do not dissent from the conclusion of the court, although for forty years the broad language of Mr. Justice Nelson in the case of The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, sub nom. Hough v. Western Transp. Co. 18 L. ed. 125, has been accepted by the profession and the admiralty courts as establishing the principle that the jurisdiction of the admiralty does not extend to injuries received by any structure affixed to the land, though such injuries were caused by a ship or other floating body. It received the approval of this court in the case of Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co. \n118 U.S. 610\n, 30 L. ed. 274, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25, and in that of Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 U.S. 388\n, 30 L. ed. 447, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254, and has been followed by the courts of at least a dozen different districts, and applied to bridges, piers, derricks, and every other class of structure permanently affixed to the soil.\n I do not think this case can be distinguished from the prior ones, as, in my opinion, it makes no difference in principle whether a beacon be affixed to piles driven into the bottom of the river or to a stone projecting from the bottom, or whether it be surrounded by 12 feet or 1 foot of water, or whether the injury be done to a wharf projecting into a navigable water, or to a beacon standing there, or whether the damage be caused by a negligent fire or by bad steering.\n I accept this case as practically overruling the former ones, and as recognizing the principle adopted by the English admiralty court jurisdiction act of 1861 ( 7), extending the jurisdiction of the admiralty court to 'any claim for damages by any ship.' This has been held in many cases to include damage done to a structure affixed to the land. The distinction between damage done to fixed and to floating structures is a somewhat artificial one, and, in my view, founded \n\n[195 U.S. 361, 369]\n\u00a0\n upon no sound principle; and the fact that Congress, under the Constitution, cannot extend our admiralty jurisdiction, affords an argument for a broad interpretation commensurate with the needs of modern commerce. To attempt to draw the line of jurisdiction between different kinds of fixed structures, as, for instance, between beacons and wharves, would lead to great confusion and much further litigation. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. MCCOY(1904)\nNo. 148\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This suit was commenced by the government to recover an amount alleged to be due on a bond to secure the performance of a contract to carry mail. The defendants were McCoy, the \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 594]\n\u00a0\n contractor and principal in the bond, and his sureties. The cause was put at issue by a general denial, and was tried in November, 1899. The government prosecuted error from a judgment of nonsuit which was entered against it. The circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit decided that the trial court was 'right in holding that the documents offered in evidence by the plaintiff were legally insufficient to make out a prima facie case for damages on account of the alleged entire failure of McCoy to perform the service provided in his contract.' It was, however, held that a prima facie right to recover the amount of a fine of $5 had been established. The judgment was, therefore, reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. 44 C. C. A. 125, 104 Fed. 669. A second trial took place in May, 1901. At that trial the case made by the government was as follows: McCoy, being the lowest bidder, was awarded a contract for carrying the mails from July 1, 1890, to June 30, 1894, between the postoffice at San Francisco and certain railroad stations and steamboat landings, and executed the bond which was sued on. On May 3, 1893, the postmaster at San Francisco telegraphed the Postoffice Department that, under a judgment rendered against McCoy, the sheriff had seized the wagons used by him in executing his contract, and would sell them on May the 5th; that the probable result of this sale would be to render it impossible for McCoy to continue to perform his contract, and that some temporary arrangement would be necessary, and asking instructions in the premises. Three days later, on May the 8th, the postmaster telegraphed the Department that the service had been absolutely abandoned by McCoy, and that a temporary arrangement had been made, to last until the Department could act. On the day after the receipt of this telegram (May 9) the Postoffice Department addressed a letter to McCoy, care of Zevely and Finley, Washington, D. C., giving the substance of the two telegrams above referred to, and asking if McCoy intended to carry out his contract. On May 17 the Department telegraphed the sureties on McCoy's bond, informing them that \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 595]\n\u00a0\n McCoy had failed to perform his contract, and inquiring if they would assume the service. On the same day the Department by telegram informed the postmaster at San Francisco that his action in providing a temporary arrangement for the performance of the service was approved. On May 18 a telegram was received by the Department from one of the sureties of McCoy, saying that he, the surety, was unable to perform the contract, and requesting to be relieved from all future liability on the bond, because his signature thereto had been 'improperly obtained.' On the same day (May 18) a finding was made by the Postmaster General that McCoy was a failing contractor, this finding being evidenced by the following certificate:\n State of California. No. 76,475.\n Regulation wagon service, San Francisco, San Francisco county. Contractor, C. C. McCoy. Pay, $7,700.00.\n Whereas C. C. McCoy, contractor on this route under the advertisement of September 16, 1889, has failed to perform the service, he is hereby declared a failing contractor.\n W. S. Bissell,\n Postmaster General.\n Date, May 18, 1893\n\n\n The Department subsequently advertised for proposals for the remaining period of McCoy's term, and the same was let to one Popper, and a contract entered into with him on the subject. Thereupon the auditor of the Postoffice Department stated the account of McCoy as a failing contractor. That account charged on the debit side the sum paid for temporary service from May 5 to August 13, 1893, the date when the new contract was awarded, and also the difference between the amount stipulated to be paid in the McCoy contract and that which the government had contracted to pay Popper, the new contractor, from August 14, 1893, to June 30, 1894, when the McCoy contract would have terminated. The account, moreover, stated a charge against McCoy of $5, the amount of a fine which had been imposed on him by the Department during the third quarter of 1893. McCoy was cred- \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 596]\n\u00a0\n ited with the whole sum which he would have earned had he performed his obligations, the balance to the debit being the amount sued for, $5,772.99. After the government had shown the facts above stated, it rested its case, and the defendant offered no evidence whatever.\n The government then requested an instruction in its favor on the ground that a prima facie case of liability had been proven. Exception was taken to the refusal of the court to give this instruction.\n The court charged the jury as follows:\n'It will not be necessary for you to retire to consider this case. You can render a verdict from your seats. This is an action in which the government sued to recover damages for breach of a mail contractor's bond- breach of the contract. The action is against the contractor and the sureties upon his bond. The government claims damages for the total abandonment of the contract without having performed it, and as to that claim all the evidence that has been offered on the part of the government is insufficient to prove that there was an abandonment, there being no testimony of any witness having knowledge of the fact that the contractor did fail. The evidence includes the statement of account made up by the auditing department of the government, in which there appears to have been a fine of $5 imposed upon the contractor for a particular failure, and in accordance with the decision of the circuit court of appeals for this circuit that evidence is sufficient prima facie to entitle the government to recover the $5, and the defendants here in open court have admitted liability for that $5. Therefore your verdict will be in favor of the government for the sum of $5. I have prepared a verdict which you will select one of your number to sign as foreman, and that will be your verdict in the case.'\n\n To this instruction the government saved an exception. From a judgment in favor of the defendant for all but $5 of the amount claimed, the government prosecuted \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 597]\n\u00a0\n error. The circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment upon the authority of the ruling made by it when the case was previously before it. This writ of error was thereupon prosecuted.\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. E. C. Hughes for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White: \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The assignments of errors and arguments at bar present two questions for decision: First. Were the copies of telegrams sent by the postmaster at San Francisco to the Postoffice Department admissible in evidence? And second, if they were, Did the certified copy of the account of McCoy as a failing contractor from the books of the auditor for the Postoffice Department, the telegrams from the postmaster at San Francisco, and the finding of the Postmaster General that McCoy was a failing contractor, make out a prima facie case for the government? Concerning the first question it suffices to say that, although it is urged that the telegrams were not admissible because they were merely copies of copies, the originals being on file in the telegraph office from which the messages were sent, the record does not show that any ruling on this subject was insisted on in the trial court, and hence no exception was taken to the introduction of the copies. As the objection that the telegrams were not the best evidence because they were merely copies was susceptible of being cured, if insisted on, it follows that the failure to so insist and reserve the question was a waiver of the objection. It then remains only to consider whether, taking into view the whole case as made by the government, a prima facie right to recover was established. Section 889 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 671), is as follows:\n'Copies of the quarterly returns of postmasters and of any papers pertaining to the accounts in the office of the sixth auditor, and transcripts from the moneyorder account-books of the Postoffice Department, when certified by the sixth auditor under the seal of his office, shall be admitted as evi- \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 599]\n\u00a0\n dence in the courts of the United States, in civil suits and criminal prosecutions; and in any civil suit, in case of delinquency of any postmaster or contractor, a statement of the account, certified as aforesaid, shall be admitted in evidence, and the court shall be authorized thereupon to give judgment and award execution, subject to the provisions of law as to proceedings in such civil suits.'\n\n The certified account from the books of the auditor for the Postoffice Department which was offered in evidence came clearly within this statute. The items in that account were ascertained and established in the regular course of official action by the Department, and represented disbursements made in the ordinary course of business for temporary service and under the new contract, all of which was occasioned by the actual or assumed default of McCoy. The payments shown by the items, therefore, properly appeared on the books of the Treasury Department. The account was clearly, therefore, competent; at least, for the purpose of showing the amount of the indebtedness, if any, existing. United States v. Stone, \n106 U.S. 525\n, 27 L. ed. 163, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287. As, however, the correctness of the items in the account depended upon proof of the fact of the delinquency of McCoy, the contractor, it remains to determine whether the evidence introduced by the government at the trial prima facie established such delinquency; in other words, whether the evidence was sufficient, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to show that McCoy had totally abandoned his contract on May 5, 1893. The solution of this question depends upon the probative force of the official finding by hthe Postmaster General that McCoy was a failing contractor, based, as it was, upon the official report on the subject, made to the Department by the postmaster at San Francisco.\n In United States v. Dumas, \n149 U.S. 278\n, 37 L. ed. 734, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 872, the court considered the act of June 17, 1878 (20 Stat. at L. 140, chapter 259,  1, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2614), which provides: 'That in any case where the Postmaster General shall be satisfied that a postmaster has made a false return of business, it shall be within his discretion \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n to withhold commissions on such returns, and to allow any compensation that, under the circumstances, he may deem reasonable.' The facts were as follows: On August 11, 1888, the then Postmaster General made an order, reciting his 'being satisfied' that Dumas had made false returns of business at the office of whcih he had been postmaster, and declaring that, in the exercise of the discretion conferred by acts of Congress, the commissions on such returns were withheld, and the compensation of the postmaster was fixed as stated in the order. As a result of this finding by the Postmaster General, an action was subsequently brought against the postmaster and his sureties, and it was decided that the order of the Postmaster General and the certified accounts of the government, which were produced and which were founded upon such order, were held to be prima facie evidence of the balance due the government.\n Moreover, by  3962 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2704), it is provided that--\n'The Postmaster General may make deductions from the pay oif contractors, for failures to perform service according to contract, and impose fines upon them for other delinquencies. He may deduct the price of the trip in all cases where the trip is not performed; and not exceeding three times the price if the failure be occasioned by the fault of the contractor or carrier.'\n\n And the 2d section of the act of August 3, 1882, chap. 379 (22 Stat. at L. 216, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2703), provides as follows:\n'Sec. 2. Whenever a contractor for postal service fails to commence proper service under the contract, or, having commenced service, fails to continue in the proper performance thereof, the Postmaster General may employ temporary service on the route, at a rate of pay per annum not to exceed the amount of the bond required to accompany proposals for service on such route, as specified in the advertisement of the route, or at not exceeding pro rata of such bond, in cases where service shall have been ordered to be increased, reduced, cur- \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 601]\n\u00a0\n tailed, or changed, subsequent to the execution of contract; the cost of such temporary service to be charged to the hcontractor, and to continue until the hcontractor commences or resumes the proper performance of service, or until the route can be relet, as now provided by law, and service commenced under the new award of contract. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act being hereby repealed.'\n\n These provisions, by necessary implication, declare that whenever the Postmaster General 'is satisfied,' from evidence which justify the imposition of fines or the deciding that a postal contractor has abandoned the performance of his contract, the Postmaster General may act as authorized in such provisions. It would seem to be an appropriate act for the Postmaster General to make distinct official evidence of the fact of such finding, to be filed among the archives of his office. The pertinency of such an official finding was, as has been shown, recognized in the Dumas Case; and, when coupled, as it is in the case at bar, with the reports upon which the finding in the certificate was based, we think the certificate was legally competent to establish prima facie the fact that McCoy had abandoned his contract. It was made the duty of the postmaster at San Francisco, by  3849 of the Revised statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2617), to 'promptly report to the Postmaster General every delinquency, neglect, or malpractice of the contractors, their agents or carriers, which comes to his knowledge.' The reports embodied in the telegrams in question on their face show that they related to facts which had come to the knowledge of the postmaster, bearing upon the delinquency of McCoy, particularly the ultimate fact of total abandonment by McCoy of his contract. The opinion in United States v. Corwin, \n129 U.S. 381\n, 32 L. ed. 710, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318, contains a clear recognition of the competency, as evidence, of official communications of this character, when made to those higher in authority, as supporting and giving evidential weight to findings based thereon. The reports contained in the tele- \n\n[193 U.S. 593, 602]\n\u00a0\n grams in question present an application of what is stated in the opinion in the Coruin Case (p. 385, L. ed. p. 711, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 319) to be 'the well-established rule that official reports and certificates made contemporaneously with the facts stated, and in the regular course of official duty, by an officer having personal knowledge of them, are admissible for the purpose of proving such facts.'\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; the judgment of the Circuit Court is also reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Kerr for respondents. \n\n[193 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\nMr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the act of Congress of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 365, chap. 217 ), a grant was made to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company in aid of the construction of a railway from Lake Superior to some point on Puget sound, with a branch via the Columbia river to a point at or near Portland, Oregon, of lands to which 'the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre-emption, or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed, and a plat thereof filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.'\n On May 31, 1870, Congress passed a joint resolution making an additional grant to the same company for the location and \n\n[193 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n construction of 'its main road to some point on Puget sound via the valley of the Columbia river, with the right to locate and construct its branch from some convenient point on its main trunk line across the Cascade mountains to Puget sound.' 16 Stat. at L. 378.\n The line east of Portland provided for in the act of 1864 formed nearly a right angle at Portland with the line from there to Puget sound provided for in the joint resolution, and thus the two grants overlapped, and the lands in suit fell within the overlap.\n But the line down the Columbia from Wallula to Portland was never built, and the grant was forfeited September 29, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 496, chap. 1040, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1598), while the line from Portland to Puget sound and east across the Cascade mountains was built and the grants earned.\n Holding that the lands in the overlap passed to the company under the resolution of 1870, the Interior Department patented those in question to the railroad company; but afterwards, and on July 18, 1895, it was held that the lands did not pass under that grant, because at its date they were reserved or appropriated under the grant of 1864 to the same company. 21 Land Dec. 57.\n That grant did not in terms reserve the lands, and the question would seem to be whether the line down the Columbia from Wallula to Portland had been definitely located May 31, 1870, since it is settled that the act of 1864 did not take any lands out of the power of disposition of Congress until the line of road was definitely located by maps duly filed as required. Northern P. R. Co. v. Sanders, \n166 U.S. 620\n, 41 L. ed. 1139, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 671; United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n176 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 358, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261. The argument that the topography of the country between Wallula and Portland was such that the lands necessarily fell within the boundaries of that grant is without merit, for it cannot be assumed that Congress intended itself to definitely locate that part of the line, in view of the language used and the settled law on the subject.\n And it does not appear that any portion of the line from Wallula to Portland was ever definitely located, but it does \n\n[193 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n appear that the line from Portland to Puget sound was definitely located under the resolution of May 31, 1870, in part September 13, 1873, and the remainder September 22, 1882; that the road was completed as located, and was accepted by the government.\n It is true that, March 6, 1865, Josiah Perham, then president of the Northern Pacific Company, transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior a map of the general line of the road, which the Secretary transmitted to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with the recommendation that the lands along the line indicated be withdrawn. But the Commissioner protested against the acceptance of the map, and his letter to the Secretary, giving his reasons, bears an indorsement in pencil to the effect that the refusal to accept was sustained by the Secretary.\n The by-laws of the company showed no authority in its president to locate the line, and its records, up to May 18, 1865, showed no action conferring such authority. No withdrawals were made under the alleged map.\n In United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n176 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 358, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261, it was held that if the Perham map were valid as a map of general route, it did not operate as a reservation, and in Doherty v. Northern P. R. Co. \n177 U.S. 421\n, 44 L. ed. 830, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 677, it was referred to as if not constituting a location even of the general route. It was not authorized by the company, was not accepted by the Department, and was practically worthless.\n It is also true that on July 30, 1870, two maps of general route were transmitted to the Secretary, one of them showing a line extending from the mouth of the Montreal river, Wisconsin, to a point at the mouth of the Walla Walla river in Washington; and the other from the mouth of the Walla Walla, extending down the valley of the Columbia river to a point near Portland, and thence northerly to a point on Puget sound. Withdrawals along the route so designated were directed, and so far as the line from Portland to Puget sound was concerned the withdrawals must have been under the resolution. And the lands in suit are opposite to that part of the line.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n The circuit court of appeals in its certificate states that it appears to that court 'that the case presents issues and facts identical with those which were involved in the case of the United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co. decided by the Supreme Court of the United States and reported in \n176 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 358, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261, with this difference,-that the defendant, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, is the grantee of both the grants of land, the overlapping portions of which are the subject of the controversy herein, and that this case is ruled by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case above referred to, unless the fact that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, by reason of being the grantee of both said land grants, is estopped to question the sufficiency of its own maps to designate the boundaries of its grant by virtue of the act of July 2, 1864.'\n The contention in the case thus referred to was that the lands there in controversy, which had been patented to the Oregon & California Railroad Company, were reserved and appropriated for the benefit of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company under the act of July 2, 1864, and by reason of the filing of the Perham map. By the act of July 25, 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 239, chap. 242], Congress made a grant of lands in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line between Portland, Oregon, and the Central Pacific Railroad in California. That grant was in the usual terms employed in such acts. Subsequently the benefit of the grant as to that part of the road to be constructed in Oregon was conferred upon the Oregon Central Railroad Company. The lands in dispute, whether place or indemnity, were within the limits of the grant of 1866. The entire line of road of the Oregon & California Railroad Company, which was the successor of the Oregon Central Railroad Company, was fully constructed and duly accepted by the president, and, at the time the suit was begun, was being operated and had been continuously operated by that company. The Oregon company filed its map of definite location in 1870, and it was accepted by the Land Department. There was no withdrawal of indemnity lands on the proposed line of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company between Wallula and Portland, nor was \n\n[193 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n there any definite location or construction of its road opposite to the lands in suit. The forfeiture act was passed September 29, 1890. It was held that nothing in the act of 1864 stood in the way of Congress subsequently granting to other railroad corporations the privilege of earning any lands that might be embraced within the general route of the Northern Pacific Railroad; and that, as the grant contained in that act did not include any lands that had been reserved or appropriated at the time the line of the Northern Pacific Railroad was definitely fixed, which it had not been at the time the act of July 25, 1866, was passed or when the line of the Oregon company was definitely located; as the lands in dispute were within the limits of the grant contained in the act of 1866, and the road of the Oregon railroad was definitely fixed at least as early as January 29, 1870, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company having done nothing prior to the latter date, except to file the Perham map of 1865, which map was not one of definite location, and was not accepted; and as, prior to the forfeiture act of September 29, 1890, there had not been any definite location of the Northern Pacific Railroad opposite the lands in dispute, there was no escape from the conclusion that the lands were lawfully earned by the Oregon company, and were rightfully patented to it.\n We do not think the fact that the Northern Pacific Company was the grantee in both grants limits the force of this decision. The resolution of 1870 and the act of July 2, 1864, were in pari materia, and no reason is perceived for holding that the act operated to exclude from the subsequent grant by the resolution.\n In Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Forsythe, \n159 U.S. 46\n, 40 L. ed. 71, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1020, two grants had been made to the state of Wisconsin, in 1856 and 1864, for the benefit of two railroad companies, and there had been a withdrawal of indemnity lands of the one grant, which conflicted with the subsequent place grant, and we held that as both grants were to the state, although one grant had been conferred on one company, and the other on another, the lands in dispute were not excepted from the later grant; and Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, said: 'For whose \n\n[193 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n benefit was the withdrawal of the lands within the indemnity limits of the Bayfield road made? Obviously, as often declared, for the benefit of the grantee. It is as though the United States had said to the grantee: we do not know whether, along the line of road, when you finally locate it, there will be six alternate sections free from any pre-emption or other claim, and, therefore, so situated that you may take title thereto, and so we will hold from sale or disposal to anyone else an additional territory of 9 miles on either side, that within those 9 miles you may select whatever lands may be necessary to make the full quota of six sections per mile. When Congress, by a subsequent act, makes a new and absolute grant to the same grantee of lands thus held by the government for the benefit of such grantee, upon what reasoning can it be said that such grant does not operate upon those lands?'\n As to the maps of general route of July 30, 1870, they were filed two months after the date of the resolution, were not maps of definite location, and included the line authorized by the resolution. These lands were opposite to part of that line, and all the unappropriated odd sections so situated, within the prescribed limits, were granted.\n The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNDERGROUND R R OF CITY OF NEW YORK v.

The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed for want of jurisdiction (116 Fed. 952), and, the question of jurisdiction being certified, the case was brought directly to this court.\n If, on the face of complainants' statement of their own case, it does not appear that the suit really and substantially involved a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution, on the determination of which the result depended, the circuit court was right and its decree must be affirmed.

Rep. 63, and cases cited.\n The bill refers to the rapid transit acts of 1891 (Laws 1891, chap. 4 ), 1894 (Laws 1894, chap. 752), and 1895 (Laws 1895, chap. 529), and sets forth their provisions for a rapid transit board empowered to construct an underground railroad in the city of New York; for the submission to the electors of the city of the question whether there should be municipal construction of railroads; for the power of the board, in case a majority vote favored municipal construction, to grant the right to maintain and operate the municipal railroad for not less than thirty-five years nor more than fifty years; for the advance by the city of the funds to construct the railroad; for the borrowing of money and the issuing of bonds therefor; for the laying out of the routes and the adoption of the plan of construction by the board; for the requisits consent of the local authorities, \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 423]\n\u00a0\n consisting of the mayor and common council, and of a majority in value of the abutting owners, or, in lieu thereof, of the supreme court of the state; for the various steps of procedure after the populat vote in favor of municipal construction; and for details of the contract for the construction and operation of the municipal road.\n The bill further alleges that the rapid transit board had determined on the construction of an underground railroad; that the local authorities have duly given their consent, and that the appellate division of the supreme court has, on application of the board, appointed three commissioners to determine whether the railroad ought to be constructed and operated; that said commissioners have duly determined that it ought to be; that their determination has been duly approved by the court, and has been taken in lieu of the consent of the property owners; that the city of New York, the municipal authorities, and board have entered into a contract, February, 1900, with defendant contractors, to construct the road over the routes determined on, and that the railroad is now in process of construction, and large sums of money have been paid out by the city therefor.\n But it is asserted that the complainants had a prior exclusive right under contract with the state to the use for underground railroad purposes of the streets now sought to be used for the municipal rapid transit road, and that the legislation is in conflict with the 14th Amendment, and  10 of article 2 of the Constitution.\n No rights created by the Constitution are asserted, and if the facts set up by the complainants are, as matter of law, wholly inadequate to show possession of contract rights as between them, or either of them, and the state, then no dispute or controversy arises in respect of an unconstitutional invasion of such rights.\n The bill avers that the Underground Railroad of the city of New York, one of the complainants, was formed August 21, 1896, by the consolidation of the Central Tunnel Railway \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 424]\n\u00a0\n Company, the New York & New Jersey Tunnel Railway Company, and the Terminal Underground Railway Company, as to the two latter of which no claim is made and no question arises.\n And it alleges that the Central Tunnel Company was organized March 26, 1881, 'under the so-called general railroad and tunnel law of the state of New York, namely, chapter 140 of the Laws of 1850, and of the various acts amendatory of and supplemental to the same, and chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880.'\n That company's articles of association declared its purpose to be 'constructing and maintaining and operating a railroad for public use in the conveyance of persons and property.'\n Chapter 140 of the Laws of New York of 1850, as amended by chapter 133 of the Laws of 1880, provided that railroad corporations formed under it should possess in addition to 'the powers conferred on corporations in the 3d title of the 18th chapter of the first part of the Revised Statutes' (which did not include power to construct railroads or to use the streets of a city), the power 'to construct their road across, along, or upon any . . . street, highway, . . . which the route of its road shall intersect or touch. . . . Nothing in this act contained shall be construed . . . to authorize the construction of any railroad not already located in, upon, or across any streets in any city, without the assent of the corporation of such city.' Laws 1850, p. 211; Laws 1880, p. 242.\n By chapter 10 of the Laws of 1860 it was provided: 'It shall not be lawful hereafter to lay, construct, or operate any railroad in, upon, or along any or either of the streets or avenues of the city of New York, wherever such railroad may commence or end, except under the authority, and subject to the regulations and restrictions, which the legislature may hereafter grant and provide' (Laws 1860, p. 16), which was carried forward into the charter of the city of New York of 1882. Laws 1882, chap. 400,  1943. This was held by the court of appeals to \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 425]\n\u00a0\n render the general railroad act inapplicable to the city of New York. Re Washington Street Asylum & P. R. Co. 115 N. Y. 442, 22 N. E. 356.\n The Constitution of the state contained, by amendment adopted in 1874, the following provision:\n'But no law shall authorize the construction or operation of a street railroad except upon the condition that the consent of the owners of one half in value of the property bounded on, and the consent also of the local authorities having the control of, that portion of the street or highway upon which its proposed to construct or operate such railroad be first obtained, or, in case the consent of such property owners cannot be obtained, the general term of the supreme court, in the district in which it is proposed to be constructed, may, upon application, appoint three commissioners, who shall determine, after a hearing of all parties interested, whether such railroad ought to be constructed or operated, and their determination, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of the consent of the property owners.'\n\n This was continued by the Constitution of 1894, which changed the words 'general term' to 'appellate division,' and the word 'district' to 'department.'\n The court of appeals ruled in People v. O'Brien, 111 N. Y. 1, 2 L. R. A. 255, 18 N. E. 692, that in order for a railroad corporation to acquire authority to construct or operate a railroad upon the streets of any municipality, not only the consent of the municipal authorities was indispensable, but that they were enpowered to grant such consent on such terms and conditions as they chose to impose.\n The 1st section of chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880 provided:\n'Whenever such road, or any part of the same, is intended to be built within the limits of any city or incorporated village of this state and to run by means of a tunnel underneath any of the streets, roads, or public places thereof, the said company, before building the same underneath any of said streets, roads, or public places, shall obtain the consent of the owners of one- \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 426]\n\u00a0\n half in value of the property bounded on the line, and the consent of the board of trustees of the village by resolution adopted at a regular meeting and entered on the records of said board, and of the proper authorities having control of said streets, roads, or public places; or in case such consent of the owners of property bounded on the line cannot be obtained, the general term of the supreme court in the district in which such city or village is situated may, upon application, appoint three commissioners who shall determine, after a hearing of all parties interested, whether such railroad ought to be allowed to be built underneath said street, roads, and public places, or any of them, . . . and the determination by said commissioners, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of the consent of said authorities and property owners.' Laws 1880, p. 872.\n\n In Re New York District R. Co., 107 N. Y. 42, 14 N. E. 187, decided in 1887, the court of appeals held that street underground roads were street railways and that the constitutional provision applied to them; that the act of 1850 had no application to street railroads, and, if it had, the authority to construct had been taken away by the act of 1860; and that the provision of the act of 1880, allowing the action of the supreme court commissioners to stand in the place of the consent of the municipal authorities, was unconstitutional, and also as to the consent of the abutting owners, because indivisible; but that perhaps the act might stand as authority for the construction of an underground street railway on condition of the assent of the city authorities and the half of abutting values, rejecting all the provisions for the appointment of commissioners.\n It follows that the Central Terminal Company could have acquired no right to build the proposed railroad without the consent of the municipal authorities and the consent of the abutting property owners, yet no such consents are asserted to have been given it, and the contrary appears on the face of the bill. But, after setting forth the provisions for a rapid transit board by the rapid transit act of 1891, as amended, \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 427]\n\u00a0\n especially in 1894, and the proceedings thereunder, which showed that the consent of the municipal authorities and of the supreme court in lieu of the property owners had been given to the municipal construction sought to be enjoined, the bill argues that the determination and consents in favor of such municipal construction amounted to authority to construct the railroad of the Central Tunnel Company because it was an underground railroad, which it had been proposed should occupy the same route or part of it, notwithstanding the railroad of that company had not been consented to by either the local authorities or the abutting property owners or the supreme court acting for them.\n We quite agree with the circuit court that this contention is wholly inadmissible. The determination of the rapid transit board and the consents of the municipal authorities and the abutting owners to municipal construction could not be regarded as inuring to the benefit of private parties who had endeavored to acquire the franchise twenty years before and had failed to perform the conditions essential to the right to construct such a road.\n The bill also avers that the consent of the abutting property owners could not be obtained by the Central Tunnel Company, and that the company applied to the general term of the supreme court for the appointment of three commissioners, and that on February 2, 1883, commissioners were appointed, one of whom declined to serve, whereupon the court appointed another commissioner, who also declined to serve; that the company thereupon applied for another appointment, and 'said application was duly granted by said court;' but that the said general term, and its successor, the appellate division, had not yet entered said order, and that, by reason of the inaction of the supreme court, the Central Tunnel Company and its successor, the Underground Railroad Company, had not been able to continue the proceedings before commissioners, and neither of said corporations had been able to commence the construction of its line of railroad. If this \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 428]\n\u00a0\n imputation of laches could, in any view, be entertained, it is enough to say that the general term in 1886 adjudged the act of 1880, under which the application was made, to be unconstitutional in respect of obtaining consents (Re New York District R. Co. 42 Hun, 621), and, as already mentioned, this decision was affirmed by the court of appeals. 107 N. Y. 42, 14 N. E. 187.\n The general railroad law of 1850 provided for the filing of a map and profile of the proposed route, and this was done by the Central Tunnel Company, March 28, 1882, and the bill claims that thereby the company obtained a contract right. But the mere filing of a map and profile by a company incorporated under that law could not give an exclusive right to the occupancy of the space included in such map and profile, as against the state. In some instances it might give priority as between railroad corporations whose corporate existence had not lapsed for nonconstruction, but only until the legislature otherwise provided. And so it was held in People v. Adirondack R. Co. 160 N. Y. 225, 54 N. E. 689, where, among other things, it was observed: 'There is no property in a naked railroad route, existing on paper only, that the state is obliged to pay for when it needs the land covered by that route for a great public use, and its officers are authorized to act by appropriate legislation.' The judgment was affirmed by this court in Adirondack R. Co. v. New York, \n176 U.S. 335\n, 44 L. ed. 492, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 460, and we said:\n'But the capacity to acquire land by condemnation for the construction of a railroad attends the franchise to be a railroad corporation, and when unexecuted cannot be held to be, in itself, a vested right, surviving the existence of the franchise, or an authorized circumscription of its scope.' . . .\n\n'We agree with the court of appeals, as has already been indicated, that the railroad company occupies no position entitling it to raise the question. The steps it had taken had not culminated in the acquisition of any property or vested right.' \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 429]\n\u00a0\n Where certain routes have been determined according to law, and the necessary consents have been obtained, and real estate has been acquired by condemanation, the situation would be entirely different. Suburban Rapid Transit Co. v. New York, 128 N. Y. 510, 28 N. E. 525. But without the consents the right to construct and operate could not become vested. Re Rochester Electric R. Co. 123 N. Y. 351, 25 N. E. 381.\n\n The Underground Railroad, one of the complainants, was, as before stated, formed by the consolidation of the Central Tunnel Company with two other companies under chapter 676 of the Laws of 1892, which provided for the consent of the proper city authorities and of the owners of one-half in value of the abutting property, or, as to the latter, the determination of commissioners, affirmed by the supreme court. Neither of these consents is alleged to have been obtained.\n It is averred, however, that the company paid, when its articles of consolidation and incorporation were filed in August, 1896, the incorporation tax of 1\/8 of 1 per cent on its capital stock, required to be paid by chapter 908 of the Laws of 1896; but the payment of a tax for the privilege of being a corporation did not carry with it the right to occupy any street of New York with its proposed railroad.\n And the fact, also asserted, that this company filed a map or profile did not as we have seen, in itself create a contract right.\n The company is alleged to have leased its road to the Rapid Transit Underground Railroad Company, the other complainant, which was incorporated in 1897, subject to the rapid transit law of the state and the railroad law under which it was incorporated. The consent of the municipal authorities and the consent of the abutting property owners, or the substituted consent of the supreme court, were essential to the right to construct a railroad, and these it never obtained. It paid the incorporation tax under the tax law of 1896, but that gave no right of construction, nor did its filing of a map or \n\n[193 U.S. 416, 430]\n\u00a0\n profile. There is also an averment that this company 'paid taxes duly assessed against it by the city, county, and state of New York,' but none that any tax was paid on the right to construct a railroad in the streets of New York.\n The result is that it appeared on the record that complainants possessed no contract rights which were impaired, or of which they were deprived, and that the suit did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to the application or construction of the Constitution.\n We, therefore, do not deem it necessary to further unfold the convolutions of this lengthy bill. Many matters attacking the validity of the rapid transit acts, and the proceedings in municipal construction thereunder, were put forward, but we are not called on to consider them in view of the conclusion that the circuit court did not acquire jurisdiction.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nW. W. MONTAGUE & CO. v. LOWRY(1904)\nNo. 46\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[193 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n This action was brought under  7 of the act of July 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp, Stat. 1901, p. 3202), commonly called the anti-trust act. The section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 7. Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error (defendants below) seek to review the judgment of the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit (52 C. C. A. 621, 115 Fed. 27), affirming a judgment for plaintiffs, entered in the circuit court for the northern district of California, upon a verdict of a jury. 106 Fed. 38.\n It appeared in evidence on the trial in the United States circuit court that the plaintiffs for many years prior to the commencement of this action had been copartners, doing business as such in the city of San Francisco in the state of California, and dealing in tiles, mantels, and grates, and that The Tile, Mantel, & Grate Association of California, and the officers and members thereof, had since on or about the-day of January, 1898, constituted under that name an unincorporated organization composed of wholesale dealers in tiles, mantels, and grates, who were citizens and residents of the city and county of San Francisco, or the city of Sacramento, or the city of San Jos e in the state of California, and such organization was also composed of the manufacturers of tiles, mantels, \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n and grates, who were residents of other states, and engaged in the sale of their manufactured articles (among others) to the various other defendants in the state of California. There were no manufacturers of tiles within the state of California, and all the defendants who were residents of that state and who were also dealers in tiles, in the prosecution of their business, procured the tiles from outside the state of California and from among those manufacturers who were made defendants herein. The manufacturers and dealers were thus engaged in the prosecution of a business which, with reference to the sales of tiles, amounted to commerce between the states. Under these circumstances the dealers in tiles, living in San Francisco, or within a radius of 200 miles thereof, and being some of the defendants in this action, together with the eastern manufacturers of tile, who are named as defendants herein, formed an association called The Tile, Mantel, & Grate Association of California. The objects of the association, as stated in the constitution thereof, were to unite all acceptable dealers in tiles, fireplace fixtures, and mantels in San Francisco and vicinity (within a radius of 200 miles) and all American manufacturers of tiles, and by frequent interchange of ideas advance the interests and promote the mutual welfare of its members.\n By its constitution, article I.,  1, it was provided that any individual, corporation, or firm engaged in or contemplating engaging in the tile, mantel, or grate business in San Francisco, or within a radius of 200 miles thereof (not manufacturers), having an established business and carrying not less than $3,000 worth of stock, and having been proposed by a member in good standing and elected, should, after having signed the constitution and by-laws governing the association, and upon the payment of an entrance fee as provided, enjoy all the privileges of membership. It was provided in the second section of the same article that all associated and individual manufacturers of tiles and fireplace fixtures throughout the United States might become nonresident members of the association upon the payment of an entrance fee as provided, and after having signed the constitution and bylaws governing \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n the association. The initiation fee was, for active members, $25, and for nonresident members $10, and each active member of the association was to pay $10 per year as dues, but no dues were charged against nonresidents.\n An executive committee was to be appointed whose duty it was to examine all applications for membership in the association and report on the same to the asociation. It does not appear what vote was necessary to elect a member, but it is alleged in the complaint that it required the unanimous consent of the association to become a member thereof, and it was further alleged that by reason of certain business difficulties there were members of the association who were antagonistic to plaintiffs, and who would not have permitted them to join if they had applied, and that plaintiffs were not eligible to join the association for the further reason that they did not carry at all times stock of the value of $3,000.\n The by-laws, after providing for the settlement of disputes between the members and their customers, by reason of liens, foreclosure proceedings, etc., enacted as follows, in article III.:\n'Sec. 7. No dealer and active member of this association shall purchase, directly or indirectly, any tile or fireplace fixtures from any manufacturer or resident or traveling agent of any manufacturer not a member of this association, neither shall they sell or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any unset tile for less than list prices to any person or persons not a member of this association, under penalty of expulsion from the association.\n\n'Sec. 8. Manufacturers of tile or fireplace fixtures or resident or traveling agents of manufacturers selling or disposing, directly or indirectly, their products or wares to any person or persons not members of the Tile, Mantel, & Grate Association of California, shall forfeit their membership in the association.'\n\n The term 'list prices,' referred to in the seventh section, was a list of prices adopted by the association, and when what are called 'unset' tile were sold by a member to any one not a member, they were sold at the list prices so adopted, which \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n were more than 50 per cent higher than when sold to a member of the association.\n The plaintiffs had established a profitable business and were competing with all the defendants who were dealers, and engaged in the business of purchasing and selling tiles, grates, and mantels in San Francisco prior to the formation of this association. The plaintiffs had also before that time been accustomed to purchase all their tile from tile manufacturers in eastern states (who were also named as parties defendant in this action), and all of those manufacturers subsequently joined the association. The plaintiffs were not members of the association and had never been, and had never applied for membership therein, and had never been invited to join the same.\n The proof shows that by reason of the formation of this association the plaintiffs have been injured in their business, because they were unable to procure tile from the manufacturers at any price, or from the dealers in San Francisco, at less than the price set forth in the price list mentioned in the seventh section of the by-laws, supra, which was more than 50 per cent over the price at which members of the association could purchase the same. Before the formation of the association the plaintiffs could and did procure their tile from the manufacturers at much less cost than it was possible for them to do from the dealers in San Francisco after its formation.\n There was proof on the part of the defendants below that the condition of carrying $3,000 worth of stock, as mentioned in the constitution, had not always been enforced, but there was no averment or proof that the article of the constitution on that subject had ever been altered or repealed.\n The jury rendered a verdict for $500 for the plaintiffs, and, pursuant to the provisions of the seventh section of the act, judgment for treble that sum, together with what the trial court decided to be a reasonable attorney's fee, was entered for the plaintiffs.\n Mr. William M. Pierson for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[193 U.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph C. Campbell and Messrs. Campbell, Metson & Campbell for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question raised by the plaintiffs in error in this case is, whether this association, described in the foregoing statement of facts, constituted or amounted to an agreement or combination in restraint of trade within the meaning of the so-called antitrust act of July 2, 1890?\n The result of the agreement when carried out was to prevent the dealer in tiles in San Francisco, who was not a member of the association, from purchasing or procuring the same upon any terms from any of the manufacturers who were such members, and all of those manufacturers who had been accustomed to sell to the plaintiffs were members. The nonmember \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n dealer was also prevented by the agreement from buying tiles of a dealer in San Francisco who was a member, excepting at a greatly enhanced price over what he would have paid to the manufacturer or to any San Francisco dealer who was a member, if he, the purchaser, were also a member of the association. The agreement, therefore, restrained trade, for it narrowed the market for the sale of tile in California from the manufacturers and dealers therein in other states, so that they could only be sold to the members of the association, and it enhanced prices to the nonmember as already stated.\n The plaintiffs endeavored in vain to procure tile for the purposes of their business from these tile manufacturers, but the latter refused to deal with them because plaintiffs were not members of the association. It is not the simple case of manufacturers of an article of commerce between the several states refusing to sell to certain other persons. The agreement is between manufacturers and dealers belonging to an association in which the dealers agree not to purchase from manufacturers not members of the association, and not to sell unset tile to any one not a member of the association for less than list prices, which are more than 50 per cent higher than the prices would be to those who were members, while the manufacturers who became members agreed not to sell to anyone not a member, and in case of a violation of the agreement they were subject to forfeiting their membership. By reason of this agreement, therefore, the market for tile is, as we have said, not only narrowed, but the prices charged by the San Francisco dealers for the unset tile to those not members of the association are more than doubled. It is urged that the sale of unset tile, provided for in the seventh section of the bylaws, is a transaction wholly within the state of California and is not in any event a violation of the act of Congress which applies only to commerce between the states. The provision as to this sale is but a part of the agreement, and it is so united with the rest as to be incapable of separation without at the same time altering the general purpose of the agreement. The whole agreement is to be construed as \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n one piece, in which the manufacturers are parties as well as the San Francisco dealers, and the refusal to sell on the part of the manfacturers is connected with and a part of the scheme which includes the enhancement of the price of the unset tile by the San Francisco dealers. The whole thing is so bound together that when looked at as a whole the sale of unset tile ceases to be a mere transaction in the state of California, and becomes part of a purpose which, when carried out, amounts to and is a contract or combination in restraint of interstate trade or commerce.\n Again, it is contended the sale of unset tile is so small in San Francisco as to be a negligible quantity; that it does not amount to 1 per cent of the business of the dealers in tile in that city. The amount of trade in the commodity is not very material, but even though such dealing heretofore has been small, it would probably largely increase when those who formerly purchased tile from the manufacturers are shut out by reason of the association and their nonmembership therein from purchasing their tile from those manufacturers, and are compelled to purchase them from the San Francisco dealers. Either the extent of the trade in unset tile would increase between the members of the association and outsiders, or else the latter would have to go out of business, because unable to longer compete with their rivals who were members. In either event, the combination, if carried out, directly effects a restraint of interstate commerce.\n It is also contended that, as the expressed object of the association was to unite therein all the dealers in San Francisco and vicinity, the plaintiffs had nothing more to do than join the association, pay their fees and dues, and become like one of the other members. It was not, however, a matter of course to permit any dealer to join. The constitution only provided for 'all acceptable dealers' joining the association. As plaintiffs were not invited to be among its founders, it would look as if they were not regarded as acceptable. However that may be, they never subsequently to its formation applied for admission. It is plain that the question of their admission, if they had so applied, was one to be arbitrarily \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n determined by the association. The constitution provided for the appointment of an executive committee, whose duty it was to examine all applications for membership in and to report on the same to the association, after which it was to decide whether the applicants should be admitted or not. If they were not acceptable, the applicant would not be admitted, and whether they were or not was a matter for the arbitrary decision of the association. Its decision that they were not acceptable was sufficient to bar their entrance.\n Again, it appears that plaintiffs were not eligible under the constitution because they did not always carry stock worth $3,000, which, by  1 of article I., was made a condition of eligibility to membership. True, it was stated in evidence that this provision had not been enforced, but there was no averment or proof that it had been repealed, and there was nothing to prevent its enforcement at any time that an application was made by anyone who could not come up to the condition. The case stands, therefore, that the plaintiffs had not been asked to join the association at its formation; that they did not fill the condition provided for in its constitution as to eligibilty, and that if they had applied their application was subject to arbitrary rejection.\n The plaintiffs, however, could not, by virtue of any agreement contained in such association, be legally put under obligation to become members in order to enable them to transact their business as they had theretofore done, and to purchase tile as they had been accustomed to do before the association was formed.\n The consequences of nonmembership were grave, if not disastrous, to the plaintiffs. It has already been shown how the prices of tile were enhanced so far as plaintiffs were concerned, and how, by means of this combination, interstate commerce was affected.\n The purchase and sale of tile between the manufacturers in one state and dealers therein in California was interstate commerce within the Addyston Pipe Case, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96. It was not a combination or monopoly among manufacturers simply, but one between them and dealers in the manufactured article, \n\n[193 U.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n which was an article of commerce between the states. United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249, did not, therefore, cover it. It is not brought within either Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, or Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 43 L. ed. 300, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. In the first case it was held that the occupation of the members of the association was not interstate commerce, and in the other that the subject- matter of the agreement did not directly relate to, embrace, or act upon interstate commerce, for the reasons which are therein stated at length. Upon examination we think it is entirely clear that the facts in the case at bar bear no resemblance to the facts set forth in either of the above cases and are not within the reasoning of either. The agreement directly affected and restrained interstate commerce.\n The case we regard as a plain one and it is unnecessary to further enlarge upon it.\n There is one other question which, although of secondary importance, is raised by the plaintiffs in error. After the rendition of the verdict the plaintiffs below claimed a reasonable attorney's fee under the seventh section of the act, and made proof of what would be a reasonable sum therefor, from which it appeared that it would be from $750 to $1,000. The trial court awarded to the plaintiffs $750. The verdict being only for $ 500, the plaintiffs in error claimed that the allowance was an improper and unreasonable one. The trial took some five days. The judgment in effect pronounced the association illegal. The amount of the attorney's fee was within the discretion of the trial court, reasonably exercised, and we do not think that in this case such discretion was abused.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH R CO v. FLANNIGAN(1904)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The action wherein was entered the judgment which is sought to be reviewed by this writ of error was begun on December 20, 1900, by the filing in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis of a petition on behalf of the Wabash Railroad Company, the plaintiff in error in this court. The defendants named in the petition were Alexander Flannigan and Virgil Rule, the present defendants in error. The cause of action was ultimately embodied in a third amended petition, filed, by leave of court, on April 15, 1901. From a recital made in the opinion of the St. Louis court of appeals the following summary of the allegations of that pleading is made:\n After asserting its existence as a consolidated corporation from a named date, plaintiff alleged that it was indebted, on June 10, 1891, to one Tourville, for wages, in the sum of $81.98; that an action to recover such indebtedness was instituted by Tourville in a court of the state of Missouri on the date named, and that a judgment was rendered in favor of \n\n[192 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n Tourville, which had been finally affirmed by this court; that in April, 1895, the defendant Flannigan recovered judgment against Tourville and the railroad company in a court of the state of Illinois, the railroad company being made garnishee in the action on account of the original indebtedness of $81.98 to Tourville, above mentioned; that Tourville had assigned the judgment obtained by him in the Missouri court to the defendant Virgil Rule, and that both the defendants Flannigan and Rule were undertaking to collect their respective judgments from the railroad company. The court was asked to permit a deposit in court of the sum of $81.98 and interest, and to require the defendants to interplead and to have determined their rights in respect to such deposited sum. The defendant Rule was served with summons, and a written appearance was filed on behalf of Flannigan, who was a nonresident.\n In stating the subsequent steps in the litigation we shall omit reference to the facts which clearly have no relevancy to the alleged Federal questions.\n Following the filing of the third amended petition an application was made for the allowance of a temporary injunction against the defendants, prohibiting them from attempting to enforce their respective judgments pending the determination of the action. An order was thereupon made, temporarily restraining the defendants, and requiring them 'to show cause, if any they have, why a temporary injunction should not be issued herein, and the relief prayed for in said third amended petition should not be granted.' A 'return' to this order to show cause was filed on behalf of the defendant Rule, and therein was set forth numerous reasons why a temporary injunction should not issue and the relief prayed in the third amended petition should not be granted. Flannigan answered, admitting each and every allegation therein, and claiming priority of lien and right of payment out of the so-called fund of $81.98. Thereafter, on April 22, 1901, the plaintiff filed a motion for the relief prayed for, notwithstand- \n\n[192 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n ing the aforesaid return of Virgil Rule, and numerous reasons were stated in support of the motion. On April 29, 1901, the court entered the following order:\n'Now at this day come the parties herein by their respective attorneys, and the order issued herein on April 15, 1901, commanding the defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be granted against them, coming on for hearing upon the pleadings, affidavits, and proofs adduced, and the court having duly considered the same, and being sufficiently advised of and concerning the premises, doth order that the prayer of plaintiff's bill be and is denied. It is further ordered by the court that the restraining order granted against defendants on April 15, 1901, be and is hereby dissolved.'\n\n A motion for rehearing was filed and overruled.\n The motion was based upon the assumption that the order in question operated as a judgment dismissing the petition. The fifteenth and last ground of the motion and the first and only specific reference made to the Constitution of the United States in the proceedings up to that time was as follows:\n'Fifteenth. Because the court erred in refusing to give full faith and credit to the judgment of a sister state, as required by the Constitution and laws of the United States.'\n\n On appeal the St. Louis court of appeals entered a judgment affirming in all things the 'judgment' of the trial court. 75 S. W. 691. No allusion was made in the opinion to any constitutional question. Application was then made to transfer the cause to the supreme court of Missouri, upon the claim that it involved 'a construction of  1 of article 4 of the Constitution of the United States.' The application was denied. A petition was next presented to the presiding judge of the St. Louis court of appeals, praying the allowance of a writ of error from this court. The petition was overruled, for the following stated reasons:\n'In Wabash R. Co. v. Tourville, \n179 U.S. 322\n, 45 L. ed. 210, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113, the judgment herein involved came under review. The validity of the Tourville judgment, as we understand the opinion, \n\n[192 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n was sustained, and its priority over that of Flannigan was adjudged. In the face of this decision we deny the writ.'\n\n A writ of error was afterwards allowed by a justice of this court. The error assigned embraced the following alleged Federal questions:\n'19. Your petitioner charges and avers that in said suit, while the same was pending in said circuit court and in said court of appeals, the construction of the following clauses of the Constitution of the United States was drawn in question, viz.:\n\n'The following clause of  1, article IV.: 'Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.'\n\n'Section 11, article IV.: 'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.'\n\n'The following clause of  1, article XIV., of amendments to the Constitution: 'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.'\n\n'Your petitioner says that the decisions of courts on said clauses of the Constitution in said cause were against the rights, title, privilege, and exemption specially set up and claimed under said clauses of said Constitution by your petitioner.'\n\n Messrs. Wells H. Blodgett and George S. Grover for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John D. Johnson and Virgil Rule for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The opinion of this court, upholding the correctness of the judgment entered by the circuit court of Missouri in favor of Tourville, referred to in the precedings statement, was announced on December 3, 1900. Wabash R. Co. v. Tourville, \n179 U.S. 322\n, 45 L. ed. 210, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113. The action now under review was begun seventeen days later. In the action which was under review in 179 U. S. the contention on behalf of the railroad company was that, despite the fact that on March 26, 1895, the supreme court of Missouri, on appeal by Tourville, had entered a judgment directing the St. Louis court of appeals to render judgment in favor of Tourville for the full amount of wages earned by him, the railroad company was yet entitled, after the filing in the St. Louis court of appeals of the mandate of the higher court, to offset against the amount of the judgment directed to be entered in favor of Tourville, the sum of the judgment recovered by Flannigan in the attachment suit which had been instituted in Illinois subsequently to the decision of the supreme court of Missouri in Tourville's action. The claim of jurisdiction in this court to review the judgment of the supreme court of Missouri, just referred to, was based upon the contention that the refusal of the Missouri courts to give to the Illinois judgment in favor of Flannigan the effect claimed for it by the railroad company was a denial of the full faith and credit to which that judgment was entitled by virtue of  1 of article IV. of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[192 U.S. 29, 37]\n\u00a0\n As already stated, the present action was begun after the opinion reported in \n179 U.S. 322\n, 45 L. ed. 210, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113, affirming the judgment of the supreme court of Missouri, was delivered.\n The controversy in the present action relates to the same judgments which were under consideration in this court in the prior action, and the purpose of the railroad company in this, as in the previous case, was to limit the amount which might be collected by the holders of the respective judgments against it to a sum which in the aggregate would not be in excess of the indebtedness to Tourville upon his original claim. In substance, therefore, the present action is but an attempt by indirection to do that which the supreme court of Missouri and this court has held in the prior action could not be done.\n The constitutional questions now urged on behalf of plaintiff in error are that the dismissal of its petition for interpleader was a denial of full faith and credit to the garnishment judgment rendered by the Illinois court, and that the denial of the relief prayed for also violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The objection, last stated, need not be further noticed, as it was asserted for the first time in the petition for the allowance of a writ of error from this court. We think it unavoidably results also that the claim of the protection of the due faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States here relied on is without merit. Nowhere in its petition for interpleader or in the proceedings had thereunder in the Missouri courts did the railroad company set up rights specifically based upon the Illinois judgment, claim for that judgment an effect which, if denied to it, would have impaired its force and effect, nor did the railroad company predicate any right to the relief demanded upon the effect due to the Illinois judgment. The relief asked by the railroad company in substance tended, on the contrary, to lessen the force and effect both of the Missouri and Illinois judgments. It was sought to change the status of the company from that of a general debtor for \n\n[192 U.S. 29, 38]\n\u00a0\n the amount due upon each judgment, and to engraft upon the judgments a limitation to a single satisfaction out of a specific fund. In its petition the railroad company expressly alleged its inability to determine whether the Illinois or the Missouri judgment possessed a priority of right to payment out of the so-called fund. Clearly, also, even the owner and holder of the Illinois judgment could not, in reason, contend that the judgment of the Missouri court complained of had the effect of denying full faith and credit to the judgment of a sister state. As the settled rule in this court is that where the Federal question asserted to be contained in a record is manifestly lacking all color of merit, the writ of error must be dismissed (Swafford v. Templetion, \n185 \nU.S. 487, 493\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1005, 1008, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783, and cases cited), it results that the writ of error in this case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH R CO v. PEARCE(1904)\nNo. 112\nArgued: Decided: January 11, 1904\n\n\n\n\n[192 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n On June 25, 1895, Charles E. Pearce, the testator of the defendants in error, commenced his action in replevin in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, to recover from the railroad company four boxes of curios. After answer a trial was had before the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment for the plaintiff, which, on May 7, 1901, was affirmed by the St. Louis court of appeals. 89 Mo. App. 437. An application to transfer the case to the supreme court of the state on the ground that it involved the validity of a statute of, or authority exercised under, the United States, was denied (State ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Bland, 168 Mo. 1, 67 S. W. 580), and thereupon it was brought here on writ of error.\n The facts are undisputed, and are as follows: Pearce was the owner of the curios, and in Yokohama, Japan, shipped them to St. Louis. The bill of lading was issued by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and recited that the goods were shipped upon the company's steamer, Empress of India, to be carried to Vancouver, British Columbia, and thence over the Canadian Pacific and connecting lines to St. Louis, Missouri. The boxes were carried to Vancouver and thence by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company over its own and a connecting line controlled by it to St. Paul, Minnesota. Upon arrival at St. Paul the custom officers took possession of the boxes, opened and examined the contents, and duly assessed the duties thereon at $ 264.31, which sum was paid by the railway company, and had to be paid in order to regain possession and forward the goods. The goods were thereafter delivered to the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company, by \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n it to the defendant at Given, Iowa, and by the latter carried to St. Louis. The inspection at St. Paul was in strict accordance with the laws of the United States, and the duties exacted were properly chargeable upon the goods. When the defendant received the goods from the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company it became responsible under its traffic agreements for the payment of the charges then on the goods, including the custom duties, and has since paid those charges. On receipt of the goods in St. Louis they were tendered to the plaintiff upon payment of the charges. The goods were shipped in bond to St. Louis, and this was so marked on the boxes. If they had been transported to St. Louis in bond, as they should have been, they would there have been opened and examined and retained in the custody and possession of the custom officers, not only during examination and inspection, but also until the duties were paid.\n Messrs. Wells H. Blodgett and George S. Grover for plaintiff in error. \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward C. Kehr for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[192 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Two questions are presented,-one of jurisdiction and the other on the merits.\n With regard to the first, the decision of the supreme court of the state is not controlling. It is not the province of a state court to determine our jurisdiction; and further, the Missouri statute, providing for a review of certain cases by the supreme court, is not identical with but more limited than  709, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), which prescribes our jurisdiction over final judgments of state courts.\n It is contended that the only question determined by the state court was the applicability of the equitable doctrine of subrogation; that no statute of Congress was suggested giving a right of subrogation in cases like this, and therefore that the decision of the state court rested upon a matter of general law. But the answer of the defendant, after stating the circum- \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n stances of the payment by the several carriers, alleged that it was 'entitled to the first lien on said goods under the laws of the United States for the amount of said duties. Although no single statute was mentioned, it claimed a lien on the goods under and by virtue of the laws of the United States, and thus directly called for a determination of a Federal right. Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 9 L. ed. 458; Proprietors of Bridges v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 1 Wall. 116-142, 17 L. ed. 571- 576; Furman v. Nichol, 8 Wall. 44, 56, 19 L. ed. 370, 376; Dooley v. Smith, 13 Wall. 604, 20 L. ed. 547. The question in fact presented and decided was not simply the scope and applicability of the doctrine of subrogation, but rather to what extent, considering the obligations cast by the revenue laws and the duties of common carriers as between themselves and the shipper, the carrier was protected by the laws of the United States in paying custom duties exacted under them. When we stop to consider the great volume of imports handled almost exclusively by common carriers, the owners or consignees being often in the interior of the country, this is obviously a question of supreme importance. And this question is solved not alone upon general principles of law, but involves an inquiry as to the effect of exactions made under authority of the statutes of the United States. We are, by  709, Rev. Stat. given jurisdiction over the final judgments of state courts 'where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed.' The contention of the railroad company is that payment of duties exacted under the statutes of the United States does not operate simply to release the goods, but also gives, in cases like the present, to the carrier, the right and privilege of maintaining possession until it is reimbursed these duties. Is the statute to be considered simply as a demand for money, or does it also carry a grant to one situated as this carrier, of a right and privilege of possession? This right and privilege was specially set up and \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n claimed by the railroad company. Whether it existed was the substantial question presented and decided. And, whether rightly or wrongly decided, the presentation of the question, the claim of the right and privilege, was, when denied by the state court, sufficient to give this court jurisdiction.\n We pass, therefore, to consider the merits. Do the laws of the United States exacting the payment of duties at ports of entry justify the carrier in paying those duties, and give to it a lien therefor as against the owner? It must be remembered that the government has not prescribed payment simply at the place of delivery, but has named the ports of entry at which, and at which only, payment can be made. Must the carrier insist that the owner shall be present at the place of entry to himself make payment, or, after notifying the owner, leave the goods in the hands of the government officials to be held for the charges thereon, or, may the carrier pay the charges, and maintain possession until reimbursed by the owner? It is unnecessary to consider what rights would exist if it were alleged that the goods imported were free from duty, or that there had been overcharges or wrongful conduct on the part of the government officials. Here the regularity of the proceedings on the part of the government officials and the correct amount of the duties collected are unquestioned.\n We are of opinion that the custom laws of the United States are potent to fully protect the carrier in the payment of the legal duties charged upon goods in its possession. In order to fully understand the force and scope of any statute or body of statutes we must have regard to the conditions and circumstances for which the legislation was intended and under which it is to become operative. We are not narrowly to read the letter and ignore the state of affairs to which that legislation was intended and is applicable. As we have said, the great body of imports is subject to duties, and payment thereof is, by statute, specifically required to be made at certain places. These imports are brought in by carriers, and distributed by them to the several places of destination. \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n It is unnecessary to cite authorities to the proposition that it is the common-law duty of the carrier to receive, carry, and deliver goods; that by virtue of this obligation it is entitled to retain possession until its charges are paid. Nor is this lien confined to the charges for its own transportation. The law is thus stated in Overton on Liens,  135, p. 166:\n'The lien attaches not alone for the particular item of charge for carriage due upon the goods, but for such other legal charges as the carrier, in the course of his duty, may have been compelled to expend upon their care, custody, and preservation. As when a railway, in the transportation of live stock, as cattle, horses, and swine, has been at expense of labor and money in feeding and preserving them, such expense is a legitimate charge in addition to their transportation. For the carrier is under special obligation to guard and protect such property, hence the propriety of a lien for such extraordinary expense and care. If a carrier, in the ordinary course of the business, pay back charges upon goods due to another carrier in the course of transportation, as they come to him, he may recover for such back charges and freight so paid; and the owner may seek his remedy for any damages done them against the party in whose hands it was done, or under his original contract of shipment.'\n\n See also Hutchinson, Carr.  478a; Ray, Freight Carr.  102. In Schouler on Bailments, p. 544, it is said:\n'A common carrier, then, may usually retain particular goods, by virtue of his lien right, until the freight and charges due thereon for his whole transportation are paid or tendered him, and he cannot be compelled to give them up sooner. This lien, moreover extends to all the proper freight and storage charges upon the goods throughout the whole of a continuous transit over successive lines; since the last carrier or final warehouseman may advance what was lawfully due his predecessors, and hold the property as security for his reimbursement.'\n\n In making payment to a connecting carrier of its freight \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n charges the carrier is not a mere volunteer, such as is referred to in AEtna L. Ins. Co. v. Middleport, \n124 U.S. 534\n, 31 L. ed. 537, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625.\n All this was matter of common knowledge, and upon this the legislation in respect to duties was enacted. It is to be supposed that Congress intended that protection to the carrier should depend upon the perhaps varying opinions of the courts of the different states as to whether, in making payment, the carrier was a mere volunteer, or whether it can be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the nation? It must be remembered that the importation of goods is a subject of national, and not of state, regulation, that such power of regulation continues until the final delivery of the imported articles, so that over the entire transportation of these goods to St. Louis, the place of delivery, the power of Congress was supreme and exclusive. It must also be remembered that bonded goods are, by  2993, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1962), deliverable only to carriers designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, who are made responsible to the United States, and are required to give bond to the United States in such form and amount and with such conditions and security as the Secretary of the Treasury shall require. Is it not reasonable to hold that Congress,-having in mind the duty of carriers in reference to transportation and delivery, their customary lien for charges, and their right to retain possession during transit,-in directing the custom house officers to take goods out of a carrier's possession, inspect and hold until the duties are paid, intended that, upon payment, the government lien should pass to the carrier, with a view of enabling it to discharge its duty of carriage and delivery to the consignee? It was not necessary to specifically state that the government's lien was transferred, for when Congress provided by statute for interrupting the carrier's common-law right of possession, it is implied that the action necessarily taken by the carrier to regain possession shall work no injury to the rights which flow from possession. Such, it seems to us, is the fair import of this legislation, enacted, as it was, in view of the \n\n[192 U.S. 179, 189]\n\u00a0\n well recognized rights and duties of carriers. The defendant should not, therefore, have been deprived of the possession of the goods without a repayment of the duties.\n It is insisted, however, that the goods were shipped in bond to St. Louis, that the Canadian Pacific for its own convenience wrongfully changed their bonded destination to the port of St. Paul, and that during the examination and inspection at St. Paul some of the curios were broken, and some lost, whereas if they had been shipped in bond to St. Louis they might have been opened and examined in the presence of the plaintiff, and injury and loss prevented. Conceding this, and that the Canadian Pacific by its wrongful act was liable for the injuries resulting to the plaintiff, the contract of shipment stipulated that each of the parties employed in the carriage should be liable only for loss or damage accruing upon its own road, and that such carriers should not be jointly liable, nor either for any loss or damage accruing upon the road of the other; so that whatever claim the plaintiff may have had for such injury and loss was only against the Canadian Pacific, and could not operate to prevent the defendant company from receiving that which, by its payment, it was entitled to.\n The judgment of the St. Louis Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWARD v. SHERMAN(1904)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: January 11, 1904\n\n\n\n\n The facts in this case are few and beyond dispute, most of them being shown by the averments in the answer of the defendant Sherman. On August 23, 1889, Ward, the plaintiff and appellant, sold to the defendants the Sunflower range, together with the cattle thereon and other personal property. A conveyance was, by agreement, made to the defendant Hardenberg, who, to secure a part of the purchase price, to wit, $25,000, evidenced by two notes of $12,500 each, made by Hardenberg and guaranteed by Sherman, executed a mortgage of the cattle and some other property. Thereafter the defendants incorporated themselves under the laws of the territory of Arizona as the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company, and transferred to it all of the property above mentioned, \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n subject to the payment of the two notes held by the plaintiff. On September 12, 1894, an agreement was entered into between the company and the plaintiff which, after reciting the indebtedness, reads as follows:\n'Whereas, the said party of the second part is unable to pay to said party of the first part the said sum of $14,500, due on October 1, 1894, and has notified said party of the first part that it will be unable to pay said sum at said time; and\n\n'Whereas, said party of the second part desires to deliver up and turn over to said party of the first part all of the property heretofore purchased by one David Hardenberg of the party of the first part, and for which said notes were given as a part of the purchase money:\n\n'Now, therefore, in consideration of the promises and agreements of said party of the first part, the said party of the second part hereby agrees to and with said party of the first part to transfer and convey by proper deeds of conveyance and bills of sale all of the real and personal property heretofore purchased by the said David Hardenberg of the said party of the first part; also, all personal and real property owned by the said party of the second part in the territory of Arizona, in whomsoever's name the same may now stand, to said party of the first part, and more particularly described as follows, to wit: The Sunflower Cattle Range in Maricopa county, Arizona territory; all cattle, horses, mules, or burros branded with either of the following brands: Diamond brand, thus: \n; H. B. brand, thus: HB; also all wagons, mowing machines, farming implements, and camp outfit, and everything pertaining to or used by said Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company, excepting only from the provision of said conveyance such cattle as shall have been sold and delivered by said Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company prior or to September 1, 1894, it being understood that all stock cattle which may have been sold subsequent to September 1, 1894, shall be accounted for by the party of the second part to said party of the first part.\n\n'That in consideration of the said party of the second part \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n sonveying to said party of the first part of all of the property hereinbefore described within thirty days from the date thereof, and delivering possession of the same to said party of the first part or his authorized agent, in said county of Maricopa aforesaid, the said party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to deliver to said David Hardenberg and one M. H. Sherman two promissory notes, each for $12,500, one of which matures on October 1, 1894, and one of which matures on October 1, 1897, heretofore executed by the said Hardenberg and Sherman to the party of the first part; also to release the said Hardenberg and Sherman from the payment of all interest due thereon, and to cancel and discharge a certain chattel mortgage executed by the said David Hardenberg to the said party of the first part, for the purpose of securing the payment of said notes, which said mortgage is now on file and of record in the office of the county recorder of Maricopa county, in the territory of Arizona.\n\n'In witness whereof, the said party of the second part, The Sherman- Hardenberg Cattle Company, has executed these presents in its corporate name, by its president, and the said party of the first part has executed these presents the day and year first above written.'\n\n The following instrument was also executed:\n Phoenix, Arizona, Sept. 29, 1894\n\n\n To J. M. Ward, Esq.:\n The Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company hereby authorizes you to enter upon and take possession of all the property belonging to the Sherman- Hardenberg Cattle Company, in accordance with and as described in that certain contract entered into by and between the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company and yourself, bearing date on the 12th day of September. A. D. 1894.\n That on receipt of said property you are to turn over to the Sherman- Hardenberg Cattle Company, at the office of C. F. Ainsworth in Phoenix, Arizona, the notes described in the \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n contract, and also to cancel the chattel mortgage held by you on the property therein referred to.\n The Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Co.,\n By C. F. Ainsworth, Its Secretary.\n I hereby authorize H. C. Ward as my agent to rec. the above described property for me.\n J. M. Ward.\n All the property mentioned in this agreement was turned over to Ward except, as he claimed, 104 head of cattle. Ward retained possession of the property, and managed it as his own, but did not cancel the mortgage or surrender the notes, insisting that he was entitled to receive the 104 head of cattle or else their value.\n On June 12, 1895, he commenced an action in the district court for the county of Maricopa, in which he set forth a copy of the first of the notes, and alleged that there was due thereon the sum of $1,500. At the same time he filed an affidavit for an attachment, in which he averred that the payment of the note was not secured by mortgage or lien upon any real or personal property, or any pledge of personal property, and that the amount due was $1,500. No property was attached and no service of process made until May 6, 1899, and then only on the defendant Sherman, who thereupon filed an answer and counterclaim, which was in the nature of a cross-bill in equity, in which he set up the purchase from Ward, the organization of the company, the transfer to the company of the property purchased and the agreement for the delivery of the porperty to Ward and the return of the notes and cancelation of the mortgage, and alleged that though the property had been delivered, the notes had not been returned nor the mortgage canceled. He also alleged a transfer by the company to himself of all its rights and claims.\n The trial court found the facts as above stated in respect to the original transactions between Ward and defendants, the organization of the company, the transfer to it and by \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n it to Sherman; and, further, in reference to the transaction between the company and Ward in 1894, it found as follows:\n'5. That during the month of September, 1894, and before the maturity of the first note, the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company attempted to make a settlement with the plaintiff, by agreeing to turn over to him the Sunflower range, all the cattle then on the range, also the desert wells, and other property which it had, which was not included in the mortgage, on condition that said plaintiff turn over and deliver up the two notes aforesaid, with the interest thereon, and cancel and satisfy the mortgage securing the same.\n\n'6. That this contract was never carried out on the part of the plaintiff; but that acting under it he took possession of all the property of the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company, as aforesaid, on or about October 1, 1894; but never turned over, delivered, or canceled said notes, or either of them, or satisfied or discharged the chattel mortgage securing the same. And that, on the contrary, he brought suit on one of said notes for the collection of a portion that he claimed to be due thereon. At the time he brought this suit on the note maturing October 1, 1894, the other note had not matured.'\n\n It thereupon adjudged that Ward was a mortgagee in possession, and, after finding the disposition which he had made of the property, entered a judgment in favor of the defendant Sherman for $17,173.50, and decreed the cancelation of the notes and mortgage.\n By  1 of an act of the territorial assembly (Laws Arizona, 1897, p. 127), it is provided that in a case appealed to the supreme court of the territory the appellant may have the testimony taken in the trial transcribed and certified by the court reporter, and filed with the papers in the case, and that thereupon it shall 'become and be a part of the record in said cause;' and be transmitted to the supreme court of the territory with the other papers in the case. That was done in this case, and part of the record taken to the supreme court \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 173]\n\u00a0\n of the territory and brought here is the duly certified transcript of the testimony taken on the trial.\n Section 2 of that act also provides that is shall not be necessary 'to file with the supreme court any transcript, assignment of errors, or other papers except as herein provided.' Section 3 requires the plaintiff in error, or appellant, to make an abstract of the record for the benefit of the opposite party and the supreme court. Sections 4 and 5 are as follows:\n'Sec. 4. Each party shall prepare and print or typewrite an argument of the points and authorities relied on. The briefs of both sides shall begin with a succinct statement of so much of the record as is essential to the questions discussed in them, referring to the printed abstract by folios and sufficient to dispense with the reading of the printed abstract on the argument. The brief of the plaintiff in error or appellant shall also next contain a distinct enumeration in the form of propositions of the several errors relied on, and all errors not assigned in the printed brief shall be deemed to have been waived. It shall not be necessary to assign or file any assignment of errors in the court below or supreme court, except those assigned in the brief of the plaintiff in error or appellant.\n\n'Sec. 5. All rulings made by the court below in opposition to the plaintiff in error or appellant shall be taken as excepted to by the party appealing or suing out the writ of error, and when assigned as error in the brief shall be reviewed by the supreme court without any bill of exceptions or other assignment of errors except as herein provided.'\n\n The record discloses that in the supreme court the appellee moved to strike from the files appellant's abstract of record. No action appears to have been taken upon this motion. The record also discloses that leave was given to the appellant to file a supplemental brief. Neither the original nor the supplemental brief, if one was filed, is before us.\nMessrs. A. A. Hoehling, Jr., A. B. Browne, and C. S. Wilson for appellant. \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 174]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles F. Ainsworth and L. E. Payson for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of the territory, without considering the merits of the case, affirmed the judgment on the ground that the assignment of errors was insufficient, citing in its opinion from a rule of practice which had been prescribed by it and in force for many years: 'All assignments of errors must distinctly specify each ground of error relied upon, and the particular ruling complained of. . . . An objection to the ruling or action of the court below will be deemed waived here, unless it has been assigned as error, in the manner above provided.' [64 Pac. 435.] Undoubtedly the assignment of errors was general in its terms. An application was made to the supreme court for leave to amend the assignment of errors, but it was denied. In a short percuriam opinion, that court, after condemning the assignments as insufficient, said:\n'The rules relating to assignments and specifications of error have been so long in force, and we have so often decided that a failure to make proper assignments amounts to a waiver of all errors which are not fundamental, that it would seem there should be no longer occasion for disregard of these plain requirements. In the absence of any assignment of error in this case, and none appearing upon the face of the record, the judgment must be affirmed.'\n\n We shall not stop to inquire whether the court erred in refusing to permit an amendment of the assignment of errors, but accepting its conclusion that the failure to make proper assignments is 'a waiver of all errors which are not fundamental,' and bearing in mind the provisions of  5 of the statute of 1897, that all rulings made by the court below in opposition to the plaintiff or appellant are to be taken as excepted to, we proceed to inquire whether there was not a fundamental error which should have been corrected by the \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 175]\n\u00a0\n supreme court. We are of opinion that there was. It may be assumed, as no objection was made on that account, that the counterclaim, which was in its nature a bill in equity for the redemption of the mortgaged property, was properly filed in this action to recover money. Can such a bill be sustained under the circumstances disclosed by the answer? It appears from that answer that the property was turned over to Ward to hold, not as mortgagee, but under a contract by which he was to take the property in satisfaction of the debt, cancel the mortgage, and return the notes. In other words, according to the averments of the answer, a contract of sale was made by the company to Ward, and under the contract of sale Ward took possession. Now, even if it be conceded that Ward's failure to perform was such a breach of the contract as entitled the company to rescind and thereafter to treat Ward as a mortgagee in possession, a bill in equity to enforce such a decision must be presented within a reasonable time. The right to rescind is an affirmative right, asserted by the vendor, the former mortgagor, and, being such, it must be asserted by him within a reasonable time. The answer alleges that on or about October 1, 1895, this agreement was made and the property delivered, but it was not filed until May 16, 1899,-more than three years and a half thereafter. During all that time, Ward was in possession of the property, managing and dealing with it as his own. Can it be that a vendor can wait three years and a half, permit the vendee to deal with the property as his own,-that property being of a value variable from year to year and requiring quiring constant care to make it prosperous,-give his time and labor to its management, take the chances of rise or fall in the market, and then, if it turns out that the business has been prosperous through his efforts, insist, on account of some technical failure, upon a rescission of the contract, and that the party who has been supposing himself the owner, and acting as such, shall be treated as a mortgagee in possession, and held to account for the success of his business efforts? In Pollock's Principles of Contracts, p. 515, the author says: \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 176]\n\u00a0\n 'The contract must be rescinded within a reasonable time, that is, before the lapse of a time after the true state of things is known, so long that, under the circumstances of the particular case, the other party may fairly infer that the right of rescission is waived.'\n See also Grymes v. Sanders, \n93 U.S. 56\n, 23 L. ed. 799; McLean v. Clapp, \n141 \nU.S. 429, 432\n, 35 S. L. ed. 804, 806, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 29.\n But was there any ground for the rescission of the contract? There was no fraud, mistake, or false representations. There is no suggestion that the contract was not entered into with full knowledge or that it was unfair in any of its details. The complaint merely is that Ward was guilty of a breach of one of its stipulations. If so, the company was entitled to damages for that breach, but no damages are shown. The company paid nothing; has lost nothing. So far as disclosed it went out of business, and therefore the failure to release the mortgage could not have injured its business credit. But whatever may be the rights, other than a simple claim of damages for breach of contract, possessed by the company and transferred by it to the defendant Sherman, they are equitable in their nature, and in respect to them the general doctrine of laches applies. We have often had occasion to consider the question of laches. In Galliher v. Cadwell, \n145 \nU.S. 368, 373\n, 36 S. L. ed. 738, 740, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 873, and Penn Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Austin, \n168 U.S. 685\n, 42 L. ed. 626, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 223, are collected the decisions of the court. In the former of these cases it is said (p. 372, L. ed. p. 740, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 874):\n'They [the adjudicated cases] proceed on the assumption that the party to whom laches is imputed has knowledge of his rights and an ample opportunity to establish them in the proper forum; that by reason of his delay the adverse party has good reason to believe that the alleged rights are worthless or have been abandoned; and that, because of the change in condition or relations during this period of delay, it would be an injustice to the latter to permit him to now assert them.'\n\n And again (p. 373, L. ed. p. 740, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 875):\n'But it is unnecessary to multiply cases. They all proceed \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 177]\n\u00a0\n upon the theory that laches is not, like limitation, a mere matter of time; but principally a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be enfored,-an inequity founded upon some change in the condition or relations of the property or the parties.'\n\n And in the last case (p. 698, L. ed. p. 631, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 228):\n'The reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the lapse of time during which the neglect to enforce the right has existed, but the changes of condition which may have arisen during the period in which there has been neglect. In other words, where a court of equity finds that the position of the parties has so changed that equitable relief cannot be afforded without doing injustice, or that the intervening rights of third persons may be destroyed or seriously impaired, it will not exert its equitable powers in order to save one from the consequences of his own neglect.'\n\n Apply these considerations to the case at bar. The property was turned over on a contract of sale. Ward was left in possession for over three years and a half without a suggestion of any claim that he was only a mortgagee in possession. He had a right to believe that he was the owner. If the contract had not been made he could have foreclosed his mortgage and acquired title by sale under foreclosure proceedings. He dealt with the property as his own. He gave his time, skill, and labor to the work of caring for it. It is impossible to replace the parties in the situation they were in at the time the contract was made. It would be grossly inequitable to deprive him of the benefit of his time, skill, and labor, and give it to the mortgagor, who all those years did nothing and gave no notice of any question of the completeness of Ward's title. It seems to us that the doctrine of laches applies with force, and that upon the pleadings the court should have adjudged the defendant not entitled either to a rescission of the contract or to hold the vendee as a mortgagee in possession.\n If we look beyond the pleadings to the testimony (and that, as we have seen, was, by virtue of the statute, made a part of the \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 178]\n\u00a0\n record of the case in the supreme court), the error of the trial court is even more apparent.\n The agreement of September 12 provided for the transfer and conveyance of all cattle on the Sunflower range, branded with the named brands, 'excepting only from the provision of said conveyance such cattle as shall have been sold and delivered by said Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company prior or to September 1, 1894, it being understood that all stock cattle which may have been sold subsequent to September 1, 1894, shall be accounted for by the party of the second part to said party of the first part.' By this all the cattle belonging to the company on September 1 were to be transferred to the plaintiff, and if any of such cattle had been sold subsequently to September 1 they were to be accounted for by the company to the plaintiff. Further, the agreement stipulated for the delivery and cancelation of the notes and mortgage 'in consideration of the said party of the second part conveying to said party of the first part all of the property hereinbefore described within thirty days from the date hereof, and delivering possession of the same to said party of the first part or his authorized agent, in said county of Maricopa aforesaid.' By the undisputed testimony two lots of cattle, one of 69 or 70 head and the other of 34 or 35 head, were sold and delivered by the company to other parties than the plaintiff after the 1st of September. Therefore the company was to account for those cattle so sold and delivered, and the duty resting upon Ward to surrender and cancel the notes and mortgage was conditioned upon the delivery within the county of the property described within thirty days from September 12. In short, the terms of the contract were clear. Ward performed all that he was under obligations to perform. The default was on the part of the company. Ward took possession of the property delivered, managed it successfully for several years, and still the court held that the defaulting party could take advantage of its own default, appropriate the entire profits of Ward's care and ability, and upon that basis adjudged against Ward the \n\n[192 U.S. 168, 179]\n\u00a0\n return of all the property then in his possession and the payment of over $ 17,000. But it is said that Ward himself repudiated the agreement because he brought suit on the first of the notes. There may have been a technical mistake in the form of the action, but there was no repudiation of the agreement, as is shown by the fact that the complaint only asked judgment for $1,500, and that Ward filed with the complaint an affidavit for an attachment, in which he averred that the payment of the sum due was 'not secured by any mortgage or lien upon real or personal property or any pledge of personal property.' But equity will not destroy rights on account of a mere technical mistake of counsel. It may be conceded that Ward should have brought an action in form for the value of the cattle not delivered, but it is manifest that that value was all that he was seeking to recover.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed and the case remanded to that court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the District Court, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings in conformity to the views herein expressed. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEDDING v. MEYLER(1904)\nNo. 125\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Merrill Moores, Cassius C. Hadley, and Charles W. Miller for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n Mr. D. W. Sanders, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[192 U.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to a circuit court of the state of Kentucky on a judgment entered there in pursuance of a mandate of the court of appeals of that state (107 Ky. 310, 53 S. W. 809, 107 Ky. 685, 60 S. W. 20 ). The action was brought upon an Indiana judgment. The answer denied the jurisdiction of the Indiana court. It was not disputed that the service in that suit was on a steamboat in the Ohio river on the Indiana side. At the trial two questions were left to the jury,-one whether the person purporting to act as the attorney of the defendant in the Indiana suit was authorized to represent him, and the other whether the summons in that suit was served on the Indiana or Kentucky side of the low-water mark of the Ohio river where it touches the Indiana shore. The jury found against the authority of the alleged attorney, and found that the service was on the Kentucky side of the low-water mark, and therefore, it is assumed, within the boundaries of Kentucky. Thereupon the plaintiffs in error (the original plaintiffs) moved for judgment notwithstanding the findings \n\n[192 U.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n of the jury, and judgment was ordered. The defendant excepted and appealed. The court of appeals sustained the exceptions and ordered a judgment on the verdict dismissing the action. A judgment was entered, as ordered, in the court below,-the above mentioned circuit court,-and this writ of error was brought.\n It is suggested that the writ of error should have been directed to the court of appeals. But it appears from the form of the order of that court that the record remained in the lower court, where judgment was ordered to be entered, and the writ properly ran to the court where the judgment had to be rendered. Rothschild v. Knight, \n184 U.S. 334\n, 46 L. ed. 573, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391. It is suggested further, that the record does not show a Federal question. But the jurisdiction of the Indiana court was put in issue by the pleadings and it is apparent from what has been said that the decision went on a denial of that jurisdiction because of the place of service. That denial could be justified only on the ground that the compact of Virginia and the act of Congress of February 4, 1791 [ 1 Stat. at L. 189, chap. 4] admitting Kentucky to the Union, did not confer the right of jurisdiction which the Indiana court attempted to exercise and which the state of Indiana claims. The judgment and the opinion of the court of appeals both disclose that the decision was against the right under the statutes referred to, and that it was on that ground only that the Indiana judgment was denied any force or effect. The question as to the right of jurisdiction sufficiently appears. pears. San Jose Land & Water Co. v. San Jose Ranche Co. \n189 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 47 S. L. ed. 765, 768, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487. It is not denied that that question is one which can be taken to this court. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co. 13 How. 518, 566, 14 L. ed. 249, 269.\n We pass to the question decided by the court of appeals. In 1789 the state of Virginia passed a statute known as the Virginia compact. This statute proposed the erection of the district of Kentucky into an independent state upon certain conditions. One of these was:  11. 'Seventh, that the use and navigation of the river Ohio, so far as the territory of the proposed state, or the territory which shall remain within the limits of this commonwealth, lies thereon, shall be \n\n[192 U.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n free and common to the citizens of the United States, and the respective jurisdictions of this commonweath and of the proposed state on the river as aforesaid shall be concurrent only with the states which may possess the opposite shores of the said river.' 13 Hening, St. at L. 17. (The previous cession by Virginia of its rights in the territory northwest of the Ohio had been on condition that the territory so ceded should be laid out and formed into states. Act of December 20, 1783, 11 Hening, St. at L. 326.) The act of Congress of February 4, 1791, chap. 4, 1 Stat. at L. 189, consents and enacts that the 'district of Kentucky, within the jurisdiction of the said commonwealth' of Virginia, shall be formed into a new state, and admitted into the Union. As a preliminary it recites the consent of the Virginia legislature by the above act of 1789\n\n\n Under article 4,  3, of the Constitution, a new state could not be formed in this way within the jurisdiction of Virginia, within which Kentucky was recognized as being by the words last quoted, without the consent of the legislature of Virginia as well as of Congress. The need of such consent also was recognized by the recital in the act of Congress. But as the consent given by Virginia was conditioned upon the jurisdiction of Kentucky on the Ohio river being concurrent only with the states to be formed on the other side, Congress necessarily assented to and adopted this condition when it assented to the act in which it was contained. Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 87, 5 L. ed. 547, 569. Thus, after the passage of the two acts, it stood absolutely enacted by the powers which between them had absolute sovereignty over all the territory concerned, that when states should be formed on the opposite shores of the river they should have concurrent jurisdiction on the river with Kentucky. 'This compact, by the sanction of Congress, has become a law of the Union. What further legislation can be desired for judicial action?' Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co. 13 How. 518, 566, 14 L. ed. 249, 269.\n It hardly is necessary to be curious or technical when dealing with law-making power, in inquiring precisely what legal conceptions shall be invoked in order to bring to pass what the legislature enacts. If the law- making power says that a \n\n[192 U.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n matter with in its competence shall be so, so it will be, so far as legal theory is concerned, without regard to the elegantia juris, or whether it fits that theory or not. But there is no trouble in giving the subsequently formed states the benefit of this legislation. In the case of Kentucky the 'compact' which the Virginia statute has been treated by this court as creating (Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 16, 90, 92, 5 L. ed. 547, 551, 569) may be regarded as having been, in the first stage, not only a law but a continuing offer to the expected new state when it should come into being, which was accepted by that state when it came into being on the terms prescribed. And so as to the new states to be formed thereafter on the other side of the river. It is true that they were strangers to the most immediate purposes of the transaction. But it must be remembered that this was legislation, and when it is enacted by the sovereign power that new states, when formed by that power, shall have a certain jurisdiction, those states as they come into existence fall within the range of the enactment, and have the jurisdiction. Whether they be said to have it by way of acceptance of an offer, or on the theory of a trust for them, or on the ground that jurisdiction was attached to the land, subject to the condition that states should be formed, or by simple legislative fiat, is not a material question, so far as this case is concerned. With that legislation in force there was no need to refer to it or to re-enact it in the act which made Indiana a state. That the states opposite to Kentucky have the jurisdiction, whatever it is, over the Ohio river, which the Virginia compact provided for, was not disputed by the majority of the Kentucky court of appeals, and has been recognized by this court and elsewhere whenever the question has come up. Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson, \n173 \nU.S. 592, 621\n, 43 S. L. ed. 823, 833, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553; Arnold v. Shields, 5 Dana, 18, 22, 30 Am. Dec. 669; Com. v. Garner, 3 Gratt. 655, 661, 710, 724, 735, 744; State v. Faudre (W. Va.) 46 S. E. 269; Carlisle v. State, 32 Ind. 55; Sherlock v. Alling, 44 Ind. 184, \n93 U.S. 99\n, 23 L. ed. 819; Memphis & C. Packet Co. v. Pikey, 142 Ind. 304, 309, 310, 40 N. E. 527; Blanchard v. Porter, 11 Ohio 138, 142.\n The question that remains, then, is the construction of the \n\n[192 U.S. 573, 584]\n\u00a0\n Virginia compact. It was suggested by one of the judges below that the words 'the respective jurisdiction . . . shall be concurrent only with the states which may possess the oppositeshore' did not import a future grant, but only a restriction; that they excluded the United States or other states, but left the jurisdiction of the states on the two sides to be determined by boundary, and therefore that the jurisdiction of Kentucky was exclusive up to its boundary line of low-water mark on the Indiana side. This interpretation seems to be without sufficient warrant to require discussion. A different one has been assumed hitherto, and is required by an accurate reading. The several jurisdictions of two states respectively over adjoining portions of a river separated by a boundary line is no more concurrent than is a similar jurisdiction over adjoining counties or strips of land. Concurrent jurisdiction, properly so-called, on rivers, is familiar to our legislation, and means the jurisdiction of two powers over one and the same place. There is no reason to give an unusual meaning to the phrase. See Sanders v. St. Louis & N. O. Anchor Line, 97 Mo. 26, 30, 3 L. R. A. 390, 10 S. W. 595; Opsahl v. Judd, 30 Minn. 126, 129, 130, 14 N. W. 575; J. S. Keator Lumber Co. v. St. Croix Boom Corp. 72 Wis. 62, 38 N. W. 529, and the cases last cited.\n The construction adopted by the majority of the court of appeals seems to us at least equally untenable. It was held that the words 'meant only that the states should have legislative jurisdiction.' But jurisdiction, whatever else or more it may mean, is jurisdictio, in its popular sense of authority to apply the law to the acts of men. Vicat, Vocab. sub. v. See Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Peters 657, 718, 9 L. ed. 1233, 1258. What the Virginia compact most certainly conferred on the states north of the Ohio was the right to administer the law below low- water mark on the river, and as part of that right, the right to serve process there with effect. State v. Mullen, 35 Iowa, 199, 205, 206. What more jurisdiction, as used in the statute, may embrace, or what law or laws properly would determine the civil or criminal effects of acts done upon the river, we have no occasion to decide in this case. But so far as applicable we adopt the statement of Chief Justice Robertson in Arnold v. \n\n[192 U.S. 573, 585]\n\u00a0\n Shields, 5 Dana, 18, 22, 30 Am. Dec. 669, 673: 'Jurisdiction, unqualified, being, as it is, the sovereign authority to make, decide on, and execute laws, a concurrence of jurisdiction, therefore, must entitle Indiana to as much power-legislative, judicial, and executive-as that possessed by Kentucky over so much of the Ohio river as flows between them.'\n The conveniences and inconveniences of concurrent jurisdiction both are obvious, and do not need to be stated. We have nothing to do with them when the law-making power has spoken. To avoid misunderstanding it may be well to add that the concurrent jurisdiction given is jurisdiction 'on' the river, and does not extend to permanent structures attached to the river bed and within the boundary of one or the other state. Therefore, such cases as Mississippi & M. R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485, 17 L. ed. 311, do not apply. State v. Mullen, 35 Iowa, 199, 206, 207.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEST v.

The offer of the district attorney, after he had made this proof, to read the testimony thus taken upon the preliminary examination, was objected to by counsel for plaintiffs in error on various grounds, the material one now urged being that it was not shown that the witness whose deposition was proposed to be read was dead, insane, or sick, nor that he was absent by the procurement of the plaintiffs in error or their counsel, and it was insisted that the reading of that testimony would be in violation of the act of 1805, being now  976 of the Revised Statutes of Louisiana, and of article 9 of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of that state, and also would violate the 6th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n The act of 1805 reads as follows:\n'All crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors shall be taken, intended, and construed according to, and in conformity with, the common law of England; and the forms of indictment (devested, however, of unnecessary prolixity), the method of trial, the rules of evidence, and all other proceedings whatsoever in the prosecution of crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors, changing what ought to be changed, shall be according to the common law, unless otherwise provided.' Acts 1805, p. 440,  33.\n\n Article 9 of the Constitution of 1898 of the state of Louisiana provides as follows:\n'In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury: Provided, that cases in which the penalty is not necessarily imprisonment at hard labor or death shall be tried by the court without a jury, or by a jury less than twelve in number, as provided elsewhere in the Constitution: Provided further, that all trials shall take place in the parish in which the offense was committed, unless the venue be changed. The accused in every instance shall \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n have the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him; he shall have the right to defend himself, to have the assistance of counsel, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.'\n\n The evidence contained in the deposition was material. The objections to the reading thereof were overruled, and the counsel for plaintiffs in error duly excepted. The deposition was then read in evidence.\n Messrs. Lionel Adams, Henry L. Lazarus, and Richard B. Otero for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Walter Guion and F. C. Zacharie for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the above statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The only question for this court to determine is whether the admission of the deposition of Thebaud as evidence upon the trial of this case deprived the plaintiffs in error of due process of law, and therefore was a violation of the 14th Amendment upon the part of the state through its judicial department.\n For many years the supreme court of Louisiana has held that upon such facts as were proved in this case it was proper to admit a deposition as evidence upon the trial of the accused; that in such circumstances he had been confronted with the witnesses within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the state. Many cases were cited by the supreme court in the opinion in this case as authority for the proposition it laid down and, after having cited them, the court, in its opinion, continued:\n'A reference to these various decisions will show that this court has repeatedly permitted the introduction in evidence of testimony of witnesses which had been taken down in writing on a preliminary examination, when the presence of the wit- \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n nesses themselves at the trial could not be obtained. In the case before us the witnesses whose written testimony was so received were permanently absent from the state, the accused were present at the examination and cross-examined the witnesses. The jurisprudence of the state on the subject fully warranted the action of the district court in permitting the testimony to be introduced.'\n\n Counsel for the plaintiffs in error in their brief used in this court concede that the law of Louisiana, as stated in the above extract from the opinion of the court in this case, 'is absolutely indisputable;' but they nevertheless urge that the decisions are founded in error and are in violation of the Constitution and mandatory statute (act of 1805; Rev. Stat.  976, supra), requiring that, in the prosecution of crimes, among other things, the rules of evidence shall be in accordance with the English common law as it stood in 1805\n\n\n We are now asked to review the decisions of the state court as to what is the law of that state regarding this question of evidence, because, as asserted, the state has, ever since 1805, made the common law, as it existed at that time, the rule as to evidence on criminal trials, and it is contended that the common law did not permit this evidence under circumstances existing in this case, and the state court, in permitting the deposition to be read, not only violated the state law, but the 14th Amendment, by refusing to the plaintiffs in error due process of law.\n Whether the state court erred in its construction of the state Constitution and statutes and the common law on the subject of reading depositions of witnesses is not a Federal question. We are bound by the construction which the state court gives to its own Constitution and statutes and to the law which may obtain in the state, under circumstances such as those existing herein. Among many of the cases to that effect, see Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77.\n As to the Federal Constitution, it will be observed that there is no specific provision therein which makes it necessary in a \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n state court that the defendant should be confronted with the witnesses against him in criminal trials. The 6th Amendment does not apply to proceedings in state courts. Spies v. Illinois, \n123 U.S. 131\n, 31 L. ed. 80, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21; Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n-174, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581, 586\n, 44 S. L. ed. 597, 599, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494. The only question, therefore, is, as we have stated, whether the reading of the deposition under the circumstances amounted to a violation by the state of the 14th Amendment, by depriving the plaintiffs in error of their liberty without due process of law.\n At common law, the right existed to read a deposition upon the trial of the defendant, if such deposition had been taken when the defendant was present and when the defendant's counsel had had an opportunity to cross- examine, upon proof being made to the satisfaction of the court that the witness was, at the time of the trial, dead, insane, too ill ever to be expected to attend the trial, or kept away by the connivance of the defendant. This much is conceded by counsel for plaintiffs in error, but they deny that the common law extended the right to so read a deposition upon proof merely of nonresidence, permanent absence, and inability to procure the evidence of the witness upon the trial.\n There is some contrariety among the authorities and text writers whether, under the common law, a deposition is admissible in such case. Assuming, however, that the state court erroneously held what the common law was on the subject, we must, in order to reverse this judgment, go further, and hold that a trial thus conducted and a deposition thus admitted did not furnish due process of law to the accused; in other words, that the refusal to exclude this deposition (an error regarding the admissibility of evidence) took away from plaintiffs in error a right of such an important and fundamental character as to deprive them of their liberty without due process of law.\n The state of Louisiana had the right to alter the common law at any time, although it had theretofore adopted it with certain limitations. If, through its courts, it erred in deciding \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n what the common law was, yet, if no fundamental and absolutely all- important right were thereby denied to an accused, he still had due process of law, and could not complain to this court regarding the error, assuming, of course, that the decision did not conflict with some specific provision of the Federal Constitution.\n As was said in Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 175\n, 44 L. ed. 120, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 78.\n'The state is not tied down by any provision of the Federal Constitution to the practice and procedure which existed at the common law. Subject to the limitations heretofore named, it may avail itself of the wisdom gathered by the experience of the century to make such changes as may be necessary. For instance, while at the common law an indictment by the grand jury was an essential preliminary to trial for felony, it is within the power of a state to abolish the grand jury entirely and proceed by information.'\n\n The limit of the full control which the state has in the proceedings of its courts, both in civil and criminal cases, is subject only to the qualification that such procedure must not work a denial of fundamental rights, or conflict with specific and applicable provisions of the Federal Constitution. Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77.\n Coming to a decision of the question before us, we are of opinion that no Federal right of the plaintiffs in error was violated by admitting this deposition in evidence. Its admission was but a slight extension of the rule of the common law, even as contended for by counsel. The extension is not of such a fundamental character as to deprive the accused of due process of law. It is neither so unreasonable nor improper as to substantially affect the rights of an accused party, or to fundamentally impair those general rights which are secured to him by the 14th Amendment. The accused had, as held by the state court in such case, been once confronted with the witness, and has had opportunity to cross-examine him, and it seems reasonable that when the state cannot procure the attendance of the witness at the trial, and he is a nonresident \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n and is permanently beyond the jurisdiction of the state, that his deposition might be read equally as well as when his attendance could not be enforced because of death or of illness, or his evidence given by reason of insanity.\n We say this with reference to the question whether the admission of the deposition fails to give the accused 'due process of law,' as provided for in the 14th Amendment. As the 6th Amendment does not apply to state courts, the question as to what is required under its provisions in order to preserve the right to be confronted with the witness is eliminated from any inquiry by this court in this case.\n We have held (Hurtado v. California, \n110 U.S. 516\n, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292) that the words 'due process of law,' in the 14th Amendment, do not require an indictment by a grand jury in the prosecution by a state for murder. We have also held (Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 U.S. 581\n, 44 L. ed. 597, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448, 494) that the trial of a person in a state court, accused as a criminal, by a jury of only eight persons instead of twelve, and his subsequent conviction and imprisonment, did not deprive him of his liberty without due process of law. See also Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77, as to a struck jury. In these cases it was held that the several rights mentioned in them were not those fundamental ones which were protected by the Federal Constitution, when presented for review under state prosecutions.\n The cases contain a somewhat full statement upon the subject of what constitutes of fulfils the requirements of 'due process of law,' so far as it relates to questions of this nature, and it is only necessary for us at this time to refer to those cases, without renewing the discussion here. Within the principle there decided the plaintiffs in error were accorded due process of law.\n It is true that the proceedings in the cases were under particular state statutes, while it is contended here that there are no state statutes authorizing the rule as laid down by the supreme court of Louisiana. But that court has held that the proceeding was justified, and the deposition admissible, under the law of that state. Whether the decision of the state court is made \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n under the authority of a statute or on its own construction of what the law of the state is, cannot, in such case as this, be a material inquiry, because the sole question for this court is whether the Federal Constitution has been violated by the decision of the state court. We think it has not.\n The cases cited from this court are not in any degree inconsistent with the views herein expressed, while some rather tend to support them.\n In Reynolds v. United States, \n98 U.S. 145\n, 25 L. ed. 244, which was a prosecution for bigamy in the territory of Utah, under  5352, Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3633), it was held that when there was some proof that an absent witness was kept away by procurement of the defendant, the burden of proof was on him to show ( having full opportunity therefor) that he was not instrumental in concealing or keeping the witness away. If the defendant failed, he was in no condition to assert his constitutional right to be confronted with the witness.\n In Mattox v. United States, \n156 U.S. 237\n, 39 L. ed. 409, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, the indictment was for murder, and it was found in the United States district court of Kansas. It was held that the testimony of a former witness of the government, once taken by a stenographer on a former trial, and fully examined and cross-examined, was admissible on a second trial, on proof of the death of the witness.\n In Murray v. Louisiana, \n163 U.S. 101\n, 41 L. ed. 87, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 990, the state court, on the trial of plaintiff in error for murder, permitted to be read the evidence of a witness taken in the presence of the accused at the preliminary hearing, read to and signed by the witness, the prosecuting officer alleging that the witness was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and his attendance could not be procured. This court refused to decide as to the admissibility of the evidence, as the bill of exceptions did not show the substance of the evidence, and, that it was material.\n In Kirby v. United States, \n174 U.S. 47\n, 43 L. ed. 890, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 574, which was the case of an indictment in the district court of the United States for the southern division of the district of South Dakota, it was held that, admitting the judgment convicting the three persons of \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 266]\n\u00a0\n stealing postage stamps under the circumstances stated in the case, under the provisions of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875, chap. 144,  2, that such judgment 'shall be conclusive evidence in the prosecution against said receiver, that the property of the United States therein described has been embezzled, stolen, or purloined' [18 Stat. at. L. 479, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3675], was improper in that the provision of the statute violated the clause of the Constitution of the United States declaring that in all criminal prosecutions the accused should be confronted with the witnesses against him, and the judgment was, therefore, reversed.\n In Motes v. United States, \n178 U.S. 458\n, 44 L. ed. 1150, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 993, which was an indictment under  5508 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712), it was held that the admission upon the trial of written statements made by one Taylor at the preliminary examination was in violation of the rights of the accused under the 6th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, declaring that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. It was so held because, as the court found, the absence of the witness was manifestly due to the negligence of the officers of the government. The witness was a witness for the prosecution, and had been once committed to jail without bail, and his absence was, therefore, not within any recognized exceptions to the general rule prescribed in the Constitution.\n These are the cases to which our attention has been called, and it is manifest there is nothing in them opposed to our judgment in this case. They are all cases arising in the Federal courts, with one exception ( Murray v. Louisiana) and in that case the question was left untouched. In the other cases they were subject to the provision of the Federal Constitution assuring the accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. But in not one of those cases was it held that, under facts such as were proved in this case, there would have been violation of the Constitution in admitting the deposition in evidence. All the cases admit some exceptions to the general rule. What those exceptions may be is a question \n\n[194 U.S. 258, 267]\n\u00a0\n for the state courts, in prosecutions therein, under the rule as already stated. The exceptions alleged in this case has not been denied by this court heretofore.\n We are unable to see that any applicable provision of the Federal Constitution has been violated by the judgment in this case, and it is, therefore, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissented. \n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL CO v. PENNSYLVANIA R CO(1904)\nNo. 90\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. D. Estabrook, Rush Taggart, and John F.

There was also a bill on the equity side praying for an injunction to restrain defendant in error from dispossessing \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 596]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff in error during the pending of the condemnation proceedings.\n The circuit court refused to approve the bond tendered with the petition for condemnation, and ordered the petition dismissed. 120 Fed. 362. The circuit court of appeals affirmed that action. 59 C. C. A. 113, 123 Fed. 33.\n The bill in equity, though not before us technically, has been freely referred to in argument, and, besides, many of the allegations of the petition are the same as those in the bill and appeal passed on in Nos. 89 and 199. The same rights are asserted under the act of July 24, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230), as there considered. The contention here, as there, is that the telegraph company has the right to maintain its lines of telegraph over and along the railroads of the railroad company upon making compensation to the railroad company for the use so appropriated, so long as the maintenance of its telegraph lines does not materially interfere with the ordinary travel of such roads, and that the right can be asserted by proceedings in eminent domain. It is conceded that there is no general law of Pennsylvania giving that right to the telegraph company. The contention that such right is given by the act of 1866 we considered in Nos. 89 and 199, and decided against the contention. But there are other elements in this case. The telegraph company is the lessee of the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company (the lease is terminable at the option of either party by giving six months' notice), and claims eminent domain as successor of that company. The claim rests upon the statute of Pennsylvania incorporating the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company. That statute was passed in 1849, and provided, in  5, that it should be lawful for the company 'to erect and construct works, edifices, fixtures, and structures along and across any of the roads, highways, streets, and waters within this state; the said works to be so placed as not to interfere with the common use of such roads, highways, streets, and waters.' The company was authorized to enter into and occupy any land for the purposes of locating and \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 597]\n\u00a0\n constructing its lines, upon securing or tendering such compensation as might be agreed on between it and the owners of the land, or in the manner mentioned in the statute. The circuit court and the circuit court of appeals rejected the claim of the telegraph company based on that act. The decision was rested on two grounds: (1) That railroads were not highways within the meaning of the statute; (2) as expressed in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals:\n'No authority to enter upon the right of way of railroads was plainly and distinctly granted, and it is well settled that the right of eminent domain may be exercised by a corporation, in any case, only when granted in express terms or by necessary implication; and that property held and applied by one corporation for a public use cannot be appropriated by another for its use without authority clearly expressed, or which may be implied from the fact (which in this case does not exist) that the use claimed is absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose for which the claimant corporation was created.

R. Co. 78 Pa. 177; Glover v. Boston, 14 Gray, 282.'\n\n\n (1)\n In the opinion in Nos. 89 and 199 we narked a distinction between highways and railroads, against a contention which identified them in legal meaning and effect. We need not enlarge upon what we there said. Highways and railroads may be assimilated in legal contemplation to a certain extent, and considerations which apply to one within that extent apply to the other. To apply them beyond that extent would be to confound the distinctions of common speech and practice, and destroy property rights long recognized to exist. And we do not deem it necessary to follow and answer in detail the very able arguments of counsel. It is enough to say that they have carried the analogies between ordinary high- \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 598]\n\u00a0\n ways and railroads too far; indeed, have gone beyond analogy, and have contended for almost legal coincidence in attributes and effect.\n\n\n (2)\n But there is another ruld applicable to grants of eminent domain, which is also fatal to the contention of the telegraph company of the rights claimed by the telegraph company under the lease from the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company. Eminent domain cannot be delegated. Lessees cannot exercise it. 1 Lewis, Em. Dom.  243, and cases cited. It is to meet this prohibition, probably, that certain allegations of the petition are made. It is alleged that the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company entered into a 'contract to lease' with the telegraph company the 1st of April, 1864; that afterwards the former company made an agreement with the railroad company whereby the latter company granted to the said Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company permission to construct and maintain a line of telegraph wires 'along and adjacent to the line of railroad' from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, 'without limit as to term and duration,' which contract was afterwards assigned to the telegraph company (plaintiff in error), and the assignment was ratified and affirmed by the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, entitled 'An Act Supplemental to an Act Entitled 'An Act to Incorporate the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company, Approved March 24, 1849, and to Confirm Certain Agreements Executed by Said Company,' Approved May three, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, the same as if the said lease and contract had been made by virtue of express authority of law- said act of assembly also providing that said Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company should have and possess all the rights, powers, and privileges conferred by the 3d and 4th sections of the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania to incorporate the Eastern Telegraph Company, approved the 5th day of April, 1866.'\n This act, the petition alleged, gave to the telegraph company 'all the corporate rights, powers, privileges, and fran- \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 599]\n\u00a0\n chises of said Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company, including the right to appropriate, on inability to agree with the owner, all lands necessary for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the said lines of telegraph from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, with any and all such branches therefrom as it may think proper.'\n The acts cited affirmed agreements or leases theretofore made. Subsequent agreements were provided for, if at all, by  3 and 4 of the act incorporating the Eastern Telgraph Company, as follows:\n'Sec. 3. That the said corporation shall have power to connect by contract with other persons or corporations having other telegraphic lines within or out of this state, for the purpose aforesaid; and it may also form a union with or lease to other corporations, associations, or individuals incorporated by this commonwealth or any other state, its own lines, with their fixtures and apparatus, or lease from any individuals, associations, or corporations incorporated by this commonwealth, or any other state, their lines, fixtures, and apparatus; and when such unions as aforesaid are formed the stock may form a common stock upon such terms and conditions as the said companies or associations respectively shall agree upon; and that as soon as such union shall be effected and a true copy of the agreement made for that purpose, duly certified under the corporate seal of the said companies, shall have been filed in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth, the stockholders of the said companies shall become one body, corporate and politic, under such name and style as they shall adopt and agree upon and embody in their certificate, with all the rights and privileges incident to a corporation and with all the rights, powers, and privileges which, by virtue of this act, are vested in the company hereby incorporated.\n\n'Sec. 4. That the said corporation shall have power to purchase, make, use, and maintain any connecting or side lines.'\n\n Under those sections the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Com- \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 600]\n\u00a0\n pany was authorized to lease its lines to the telegraph company. A lease had already been made, as we have seen. Those sections also authorized the companies to 'form a union' and 'become a body corporate and politic, under such name and style' as they should adopt. That was not done. The telegraph company, therefore, is the simple lessee of the Atlantic & Ohio Company, and has only the powers of a lessee, and as such cannot exercise the right of eminent domain conferred on the Atlantic & Ohio Company.\n It is, however, further alleged that the telegraph company, by the power vested in it by the lease from the Atlantic & Ohio Company and the acts of the Pennsylvania legislature confirming the same, and 'in the exercise of all and every other power enabling it in anywise to do so,' duly located a single line of telegraph along and upon the right of way of the railroad company, and attempted to agree with the latter company upon the prices of compensation therefor; and 'that the aforesaid corporate action of the Western Union Telegraph Company has been duly ratified and approved by corporate action in that behalf by the said Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company.'\n It will be observed that the location, so called, was made by the telegraph company and in its own name. It was not made by the Atlantic & Ohio Company and in its name. And the Atlantic & Ohio Company is not a party to this action. The action was commenced and is prosecuted by the telegraph company alone. The prayer is that, upon the payment of the compensation which shall be directed to be paid for the 'rights and interests acquired thereby (that is, by the statutes and proceedings set out in the petition) by the said Western Union Telegraph Company, possession be adjudged to the Western Union Telegraph Company by this court of the said use, right, and interests according to law, and that the title to the said rights and interests, as against the defendant, thereby vest in the said Western Union Telegraph Company for the purposes aforesaid; . . .' \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 601]\n\u00a0\n If it can be said that under the allegations of the petition the Atlantic & Ohio Company retains its rights as the lessor of the telegraph company, still as to such rights it is a necessary party. To have made it a party might have precluded jurisdiction in the circuit court.\n But the telegraph company contends for eminent domain in its own right as lessee of the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company, and in its own name, and combats the view that it cannot receive a delegation of that power. The following cases are relied on: California C. R. Co. v. Hooper, 76 Cal. 404, 18 Pac. 599; Crolley v. Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. 30 Minn. 541, 16 N. W. 422; Chicago & W. I. R. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 113 Ill. 156; Kip v. New York & H. R. Co. 6 Hun. 24, 67 N. Y. 227; Abbott v. New York & N. E. R. Co. 145 Mass. 450, 15 N. E. 91.\n These cases do not sustain the contention. In the case in 76 Cal. a corporation commenced proceedings in eminent domain. It afterwards consolidated with other corporations. The new corporation thus created was held to be entitled to continue the proceedings in its own name and for its benefit, because it had acquired that right in the manner provided by the statutes of the state.\n In 30 Minn. a railroad corporation condemned, paid for, and took certain land for its right of way. Without constructing its road, it transferred the right of way to another railroad corporation. The owner of the land taken brought ejectment for it, alleging the invalidity of the transfer. It was held that his interests were not affected by the transfer, and he could not question the capacity of the first company to make, nor the second company to receive, the transfer.\n In 113 Ill. the facts are somewhat complicated, but the point decided relevant to our present discussion is that it mattered not that the necessity for an increase of a right of way of a railroad company for additional tracks was caused by the use of the road by other companies acting under lease or by contract, nor by what company or companies the road \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 602]\n\u00a0\n was operated. It was still a public use, and (to quote the court) 'the needs of the lessees are as those of the lessor company, and any condemnation for their wants may proceed in such latter company's name, and it all the while stands responsible for the running of the road.' Kip v. New York & H. R. Co. 6 Hun, 24, and 67 N. Y. 227, were cited.\n If this case supports one contention of the telegraph company, it destroys another. It establishes that, if the right of eminent domain is given to the telegraph company by the lease from the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company, that right can only be exercised in the name of the latter company. And such is also the effect of the cited cases, or, rather, the cited case, for it is only one case appearing at different stages in the reports. The plaintiff in the case, who was appellant in the court of appeals (67 N. Y. 227), brought suit against the defendant company to restrain it from prosecuting proceedings to condemn certain lands owned by him in the city of New York. He had leased them to the company for twenty- one years, and his contention was that the condemnation proceedings would impair the obligation of the lease and should be enjoined.\n The plaintiff alleged also a lease by the defendant of its road and property to the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company for 401 years, and claimed that the lease abrogated the proceedings to condemn the land, and terminated and removed all necessity for its acquisition for the use of the defendant. It was held (1) that the relation created by the lease was no impediment to the exercise of eminent domain conferred upon the company by the statute of the state; and (2) that the proceedings to condemn were not affected by the lease. The court observed that the same necessity existed in favor of the defendant after as before the lease, and if the necessity was only in favor of the lessee it was competent for 'the lessee to continue the proceedings in the name of the defendant.' (Italics ours.) \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 603]\n\u00a0\n In Abbott v. New York & N. E. R Co. the questions involved were whether the power to take land by eminent domain may be given to a foreign corporation, and whether a corporation by the consent of the legislature may take the power as a quasi successor of another corporation to which it was originally granted. Under the statutes of the state those questions were answered in the affirmative, and it was in regard to those questions and statutes that Chief Justice Holmes, now a justice of this court, said that the reasons which have led some courts and judges to doubt the necessity of the consent of the legislature to a transfer of the right of eminent domain from one corporation to another 'show that the delectus personarum is of little more than theoretical importance, and is the least determining element in the more common cases where the power is conferred.' The case is not like that at bar, and need not be further analyzed.\n A case more applicable to the case at bar is Worcester v. Norwich & W. R. Co. 109 Mass. 103. In that case the railroad company was required to unite with others in establishing a passenger station. Resisting the proceedings which were brought to appoint commissioners to select a location, it was urged that it might become necessary to exercise the right of eminent domain, and against that the railroad pleaded a lease to the Boston, Hartford, & Erie Railroad Company, which had been confirmed by the legislature. There were other transfers of interests, and of them and the lease the court said: 'Yet none of these leases or assignments can be construed to extend to the lessees or assignees the power to exercise the right of eminent domain, or to restrict the right of the legislature to alter or repeal the charters.' And again: 'The lease by the Norwich & Worcester Railroad Company did not make the lessees, or their representatives, parties to the grant of power to exercise the right of eminent domain. That right remained in the original corporation, and the legislature might properly deal with it exclusively in amending their (its) charter.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[195 U.S. 594, 604]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissenting:\n The judgment of the circuit court in this case rests mainly upon the same grounds as the judgment in cases Nos. 89 and 199. For the reasons stated in my opinion in those cases, I dissent from the opinion and judgment in this case. \n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL CO v. PENNSYLVANIA R CO(1904)\nNo. 199\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n This is a bill in equity filed in the circuit court of the District of New Jersey by the appellant against the appellee, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to prevent the latter from removing from various railroad companies' rights of way the telegraph lines of the appellant. The bill was filed in aid of a petition on the law side of the court, praying the court to issue its process or take such modes of procedure as might be \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n agreeable to the principles and usages of law, to determine the amount of compensation to be paid by appellant to appellee for the use of the right of way of the appellee, and its branches and connecting lines, to construct, maintain, and operate a line of telegraph over and along such railways, subject to the conditions and provisions named in the act of Congress of July 24, 1866. 14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230, Rev. Stat.  5263 et seq. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3579\n\n\n The construction of this act of Congress is the main question in the case.\n The appellant, which we shall designate the telegraph company, contends that under certain acts of Congress the roads of the railroad company and all other railroads in the United States are made post roads, and that by the act of July 24, 1866, the telegraph company has the right to construct, maintain, and operate lines of telegraph along said roads upon the payment of compensation to the railroad company. In other words, the contention is that by the act of 1866 the telegraph company is given the power of eminent domain to acquire the right to occupy with its telegraph lines the rights of way of the railroad company.\n A summary of the bill is as follows: The telegraph company is a New York corporation; the railroad company is a Pennsylvania corporation. The New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, and is the owner of a railroad extending from Jersey City, in the state of New Jersey, to the Delaware river at the city of Trenton, in said state, with certain branches, which the bill describes. The railroad company is the owner of a line of railroad extending from the city of Philadelphia to the city of Pittsburg, in the state of Pennsylvania, and in possession and control of the railroads of the New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company in New Jersey, under a lease or leases for a period of 999 years from the 1st of July, 1871. By the laws of New Jersey the said railroads were created and made and are now public highways, and hence are subject to occupation and use of telegraph companies \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n under the provisions and conditions of the act of Congress of July 24, 1866.\n The telegraph company was organized in 1851, and began then to construct and has constructed and acquired a continuous system of telegraph lines, which extends through all of the states and territories of the United States, and connects with telegraph lines in the Dominion of Canada, and with lines also in the Republic of Mexico and South American Republics, and with and by submarine cables with the systems of all telegraph lines of foreign countries.\n The system operated directly by the telegraph company consists of over 192,000 miles of poles and cables, and over 900,000 miles of wire; and an important part of the system and connected with its main office in New York city, and with other lines leading to the important cities of the West, is the lines of telegraph over and along the lines of railway operated by the railroad company, connecting Jersey City with Philadelphia, and connecting with other lines of the system.\n The lines of telegraph along the railways in New Jersey were originally constructed by the American Telegraph Company, a corporation of the state of New Jersey, with the consent of, or under contracts and arrangement with the railway company then owning the said lines of railway, and were constructed more than forty years ago; and since the 20th of September, 1881, the telegraph lines over the right of way of said railroads have been maintained and operated and compensation paid therefor under the provisions of a contract between the telegraph company and the railroad company. The contract granted to the telegraph company the rigth to place, maintain, and use upon the line of the right of way of the railroad company, and of the railroads owned, operated, or leased by it, a single line of telegraph poles (in certain cases two were authorized), with the privilege of erecting and maintaining thereon such number of wires as the telegraph company might from time to time elect, said lines \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n to be located and placed under the direction of an officer of the railroad company.\n The telegraph company agreed to pay annually for the privileges granted the sum of $75,000, in monthly instalments of $6,250, and to deliver to the railroad company certain poles and wire, which were then on certain of their roads. The telegraph company also agreed to transmit the messages of the railroad company at a compensation which was stated.\n The provisions for the termination of the agreement and in the event of its termination are as follows:\n'Thirteenth. This agreement is to continue in force for and during the term of twenty years from its date, and shall be binding upon the respective companies, their successors and assigns, and neither party shall have the right to assign the whole, or any part hereof, without the consent of the other, given in writing.\n\n ... * *\n'Fifteenth. If any monthly payment herein provided for be not made within sixty days after it shall have become due, and shall have been demanded by written notice, delivered to the treasurer, or an executive officer of the party in default, or if any other covenant herein made shall not, after sixty days' written notice of default and demand made by either party in the manner herein provided, be fulfilled by the other party, the contract may, at the option of the party demanding such fulfilment, be rescinded, and such rescission shall not relieve the party in default from liability for any amount due, or for damages for nonfulfilment of such covenant or of any other covenant.\n\n'Sixteenth. If no new agreement be made by the parties hereto, the telegraph company shall, at the termination of this contract, or at any time hereafter, upon receiving written notice from the railroad company, remove, within six months from the receipt of said notice, all of its poles and wires, and leave the property of the railroad company in good condi- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n tion and free from the encumbrance thereof to the satisfaction of the general manager or other proper officer of the railroad company, and if not so removed the railroad company may remove them at the expense of the telegraph company: Provided, however, That the payment agreed to be made by the telegraph company to the railroad company in the sixth clause hereof, and by the railroad company in the eighth clause, shall not apply to the said six months, the companies respectively hereby expressly agreeing to waive the same.'\n\n The agreement contains the following provision:\n'Any easement or right of way heretofore acquired by the telegraph company upon any of the roads embraced in this agreement, either directly by contract or by assignment of contracts or agreements made by other companies with the railroad company, or with any of the companies whose roads or property are embraced in the schedule hereto attached, is hereby relinquished and abandoned, and the rights and easements of the telegraph company upon the right of way of said railroad company shall be such only as are granted by this agreement, and shall cease with its termination.'\n\n The agreement was carried out and the payments made as provided, the last being made on the 20th of June, 1902.\n On the 14th of May, 1902, the railroad company notified the telegraph company in writing to remove its poles, wires, and other property from the right of way and property of the railroad company and of the other companies mentioned in the agreement, within six months from the 1st day of June, 1902. The notice stated that in default of compliance the railroad company would itself cause such poles, wires, and other property of the telegraph company to be removed from the right of way at the expense of the latter company.\n It is alleged in the bill that, by reason of the facts set forth, and by reason of the receipt of payments after the 21st of September, 1901, and after the notice of removal, the agreement was continued in force, and that the railroad company had no right, notwithstanding the notice of May 14, \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 545]\n\u00a0\n 1902, to remove or cause to be removed from the line of its railways the poles, wires, and telegraph property of the telegraph company at the end of six months from the 1st day of June, 1902.\n It is also alleged that the lines of telegraph have been maintained and operated over the lines of railway without interfering with the ordinary use and operation thereof, or the ordinary travel thereon, and, as now located, maintained, and operated, can be continued so as not to interfere with the future operation and maintenance of the said railways, or the ordinary travel upon them, subject only to such slight changes of some of the poles of said lines as may be incident to the construction of additional tracks upon said right of way, or shifting the tracks already existing on said railways.\n May 20, 1902, the president and general manager of the telegraph company, in a letter addressed to the president of the railroad company, acknowledged receipt of the notice of removal of May 14, and stated that he understood that negotiations had been in progress between the officers of the respective companies for a renewal of the contract of September 20, 1881, and declared that he would be glad to take up the matter actively either in New York or in Philadelphia, at the convenience of the president of the railroad company. The following day the president of the railway company replied, stating that none of the companies named 'desires to renew or extend its contract with the Western Union Telegraph Company,' and that the contract between the companies had terminated under its terms on the 20th of September, 1901, and the notice to the telegraph company to remove its poles had been given in accordance with the provisions of the contract. A willingness to discuss any temporary arrangement which might be necessary during the time allowed for the removal of the poles of the telegraph company was expressed. A somewhat lengthy reply was made, in which the telegraph company claimed that since some of the contracts referred to by the railroad company were per- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 546]\n\u00a0\n petual in their terms, or ran during the life of the parties, they could not be terminated by one party without the consent of the other; asserted a right, under the laws of Congress and the laws and Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, to maintain and operate its lines of telegraph on the railroad company's roads, subject only, at most, to make a fair and reasonable compensation for such right, which it offered to pay, and requested, if the railroad company declined to contract further with it, a meeting for the purpose of agreeing upon the amount of such compensation, or to submit the matter to arbitration. The railroad company replied that the meeting requested would be useless, as the telegraph company asserted rights upon the lines of the railroad company which could not be conceded. It was stated in the reply that the railroad company had agreed and contracted with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company covering the railroads included in the contract with the telegraph company, and that the Postal Telegraph Cable Company would immediately commence transacting a commercial telegraph business at the stations of the railroad company. The railroad company offered to permit the telegraph company to do business at the railroad stations until September 30 next ensuing (1902); and for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary loss to the telegraph company, incident to the removal of its poles, the railroad company expressed a willingness to purchase, at a fair valuation, such of the lines as it could make use of.\n It is alleged in the bill that the notice given to the telegraph company to remove its poles from the railroads, and the refusal of the railroad company to negotiate further with the telegraph company, were not induced from any compulsion or necessity to use the space occupied by the telegraph lines, but that the purpose of the railroad company is to place upon the lines of railway telegraph lines to be owned or used by another telegraph company; and it is alleged that the lines of the telegraph company will not interfere with the ordinary travel and use of the railways.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 540, 547]\n\u00a0\n The directors of the telegraph company accepted the act of July 24, 1866, and filed an acceptance with the Postmaster General of the United States June 8, 1867.\n The acts of Congress hereinafter mentioned and set out are referred to in the bill, and a full compliance therewith alleged, whereby, it is further alleged, the telegraph company became and is entitled to maintain its lines on the railroads of the railroad company upon paying just compensation, the payment of which was offered. The prayer is that the court order and decree the amount of compensation to be paid by the telegraph company, or, if the court order compensation to be ascertained at law, it then be decreed that upon payment of such compensation a perpetual injunction issue.\n A preliminary injunction was ordered. 120 Fed. 981. It was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. 59 C. C. A. 113, 123 Fed. 33.\n A controversy ensued upon the form of the decree. The circuit court of appeals simply reversed the order of the circuit court granting a preliminary injunction. The telegraph company moved that the decree be modified so as to direct the dismissal of the bill. The motion was refused, and the telegraph company took an appeal to this court. Subsequently the circuit court sua sponte entered an order dismissing the bill, and the telegraph company appealed therefrom to the circuit court of appeals. The case was then removed to this court by certiorari.\n H. D. Estabrook, Rush Taggart, John F. Dillon, and Richard Vliet Lindabury for the Western Union Telegraph Company.\n\n\n[195 U.S. 540, 555]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John G. Johnson for the railroad company.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[195 U.S. 540, 557]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.\n By an act of Congress approved July 7, 1838 [5 Stat. at L. 271, chap. 172] and by cubsequent acts (March 3, 1853, 10 Stat. at L. 225, chap. 146; Rev. Stat.  3964, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2707; June 8, 1872 [17 Stat. at L. 283, chap. 335,]) railroads within the limits of the United States were made post routes or roads.\n By act of March 1, 1884, it is provided 'that all public roads and highways, while kept up and maintained as such, are hereby declared to be post routes.' 23 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 9, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2708.\n The act of 1866 is as follows:\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 558]\n\u00a0\n the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any telegraph company now organized, or which may hereafter be organized under the laws of any state in this Union, shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate lines of telegraph through and over any portion of the public domain of the United States, over and along any of the military or post roads of the United States which have been or may hereafter be declared such by act of Congress, and over, under, or across the navigable streams or waters of the United States: Provided, That such lines of telegraph shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct the navigation of such streams and waters, or interfere with the ordinary travel on such military or post roads. And any of said companies shall have the right to take and use from such public lands the necessary stone, timber, and other materials for its posts, piers, stations, and other needful uses in the construction, maintenance, and operation of said lines of telegraph, and may pre-empt and use such portion of the unoccupied public lands subject to pre-emption, through which its said lines of telegraph may be located, as may be necessary for its stations, not exceeding forty acres for each station; but such stations shall not be within fifteen miles of each other.\n\n'Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That telegraphic communications between the several departments of the government of the United States and their officers and agents shall, in their transmission over the lines of any of said companies, have priority over all other business, and shall be sent at rates to be annually fixed by the Postmaster General.\n\n'Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That the rights and privileges hereby granted shall not be transferred by any company acting under this act, to any other corporation, association, or person: Provided, however, That the United States may at any time after the expiration of five years from the passage of this act, for postal, military, or other purposes, purchase all the telegraph lines, property, and effects of any or all of said companies at an appraised value, to be ascer- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 559]\n\u00a0\n tained by five competent, disinterested persons, two of whom shall be selected by the Postmaster General of the United States, two by the company interested, and one by the four so previously selected.\n\n'Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That before any telegraph company shall exercise any of the powers or privileges conferred by this act, such company shall file their written acceptance, with the Postmaster General, of the restrictions and obligations required by this act.'\n\n The construction of this act is the fundamental question in the case. The telegraph company contends that the necessary implication from the provisions of the act is that telegraph companies may enter and appropriate for their poles and lines a part of the rights of way of railroads in invitum upon paying just compensation. In other words, that the act invests telegraph companies with the right of eminent domain. The railroad company denies this construction, and asserts that the act gives the consent of the government to telegraph companies to construct lines through its public domain and over and along its military and post roads, which are not the property of private corporations, and across navigable streams and waters. The act gives no right, the railroad company contends, to appropriate private property, but is an exercise by Congress of the national power over interstate commerce to secure telegraph companies from 'hostile state legislation or contracts violative of an announced public policy.' In other words, the contention of the railroad company is that, after the act of 1866 was passed, it 'became impossible for the states, by any legislation, to exclude telegraph companies from the post roads.' The contentions of the parties are opposed, therefore, only as to the degree of right conferred by the act. It is asserted by one party, and unqualifiedly admitted by the other, that Congress has power to grant the power of eminent domain to corporations organized for national purposes, and the arguments of the parties are addressed only to the considerations which serve to deter- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 560]\n\u00a0\n mine the intention of Congress. Both parties also claim authority for their respective contentions.\n\n 1. \nThe act of 1866 came before this court for consideration over twenty-five years ago, in Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 U.S. 1\n, 24 L. ed. 708. The language of the court defining the rights conferred by the act has recently been repeated and sanctioned in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867. In both cases the judgment of the court was adverse to the rights claimed under that act by the telegraph company in the case at bar. A review of those cases, therefore, and a consideration of the arguments directed against them and in support of them will constitute the most appropriate discussion of the questions now presented, and apply immediately to their solution the authority of this court.\n In Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 U.S. 1\n, 24 L. ed. 708, the legislature of Florida in 1866 granted to the Pensacola Telegraph Company 'the sole and exclusive privilege and right' of maintaining and operating lines of telegraph through certain counties of the state. In 1872 the property of the Alabama & Florida Railroad Company was transferred to the Pensacola & Louisville Railroad Company. On the 14th of February, 1873, the legislature of Florida passed an act, which was amended in 1874, authorizing the last-named company to construct and maintain a telegraph line along its railroad, and to connect with lines in and out of the state. This was in the territory embraced by the exclusive grant to the Pensacola Telegraph Company.\n On the 24th of June, 1874, the Pensacola & Louisville Railroad Company granted to the Western Union Telegraph Company the right to erect a telegraph line upon its right of way, and transferred to it all the rights and privileges conferred by the act of February, 1873, and 1874. The Western Union Company immediately commenced the erection of the line, but before its completion the Pensacola Telegraph Company filed a bill to enjoin the work, on account \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 561]\n\u00a0\n of the alleged exclusive right of that company under its charter. Upon the hearing a decree was passed dismissing the bill, and an appeal was taken to this court. The Western Union Telegraph Company had accepted the act of 1866, and claimed to erect and maintain a telegraph line under its agreement with the Pensacola & Louisville Railroad Company, and under the provisions of that act. The case, therefore, presented an issue between rights asserted under a statute of Florida and rights given and protected by the act of 1866. The issue was important. The act of 1866 was presented for the first time for interpretation, and upon it depended not only the private rights of the contending companies, but the more serious conflict of powers derived from the national and state governments. The questions, therefore, which bore on these issues called for, and, it is evident from the opinion of the court, received, careful attention.\n The first of these questions was whether the act of 1866 was a grant to telegraph companies of portions of the public domain and of rights in the public domain, or a grant of rights having a broader field of exercise,- a grant of rights having operation and to be exercised throughout the whole of the United States. There was a marked difference in the rights contended for, and they depended upon different powers. In the public domain the government was proprietor as well as sovereign, elsewhere only sovereign, and on its powers as sovereign there were limitations, arising not only from the rights of the states, but arising from the ownership of private property and the necessity of a grant of eminent domain to appropriate it. These limitations were of consequence in fixing exactly the rights conferred by the act of 1866, and were regarded by the court in its construction of that act.\n The court declared, through Chief Justice Waite, that the act of 1866 was an exercise of the power of Congress over interstate commerce, and the power to establish postoffices and post roads, and, like other powers of the national government, could be exercised 'upon every foot of territory under \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 562]\n\u00a0\n its jurisdiction.' It was held, therefore, that the act was not a grant of rights only in the public domain, and the character of the rights was made unmistakable. The statute, the court said, 'in effect amounts to a prohibition of all state monopolies' in commercial intercourse by telegraph. This is expressed more than once as the fundamental idea and sole purpose of the statute. The court further said: 'It [the statute] substantially declares, in the interest of commerce and the convenient transmission of intelligence from place to place by the government of the United States and its citizens, that the erection of the telegraph lines shall, so far as state interference is concerned, be free to all who will submit to the conditions imposed by Congress, and that corporations organized under the laws of one state for constructing and operating telegraph lines shall not be excluded by another from prosecuting their business within its jurisdiction, if they accept the terms proposed by the national government for this national privilege. To this extent, certainly, the statute is a legitimate regulation of commercial intercourse among the states, and is appropriate legislation to carry into execution the powers of Congress over the postal service.'\n And this construction, making the act of 1866 merely an exercise of national power to withdraw from state control or interference commercial intercourse by telegraph, is further emphasized in the opinion and the objections to it completely answered, which were based on the ownership of the post roads by individuals or corporations, and the necessity of implying a grant of the power of eminent domain to telegraph companies to appropriate them. The court said:\n'It [the act of 1866] gives no foreign corporation the right to enter upon private property without the consent of the owner, and erect the necessary structures for its business; but it does provide that, whenever the consent of the owner is obtained, no state legislation shall prevent the occupation of post roads for telegraph purposes by such corporations as are willing to avail themselves of its privileges.' \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 563]\n\u00a0\n And again:\n\n'No question arises as to the authority of Congress to provide for the appropriation of private property to the uses of the telegraph, for no such attempt has been made. The use of public property alone is granted. If private property is required, it must, so far as the present legislation is concerned, be obtained by private arrangement with its owner. No compulsory proceedings are authorized. State sovereignty under the Constitution is not interfered with. Only national privileges are granted.'\n\n This language and the distinctions imported by it were approved in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. ct. Rep. 867. It was a bill in equity filed in the circuit court of Benzie county, Michigan, by a telegraph company against a railway company to restrain the latter from interfering with the rights of the telegraph company in a certain telegraph line along the right of way of the railroad. It was removed to the circuit court of the United States. The circuit court dismissed the bill, and its action was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 33 C. C. A. 113, 61 U. S. App. 741, 90 Fed. 379. The Western Union Telegraph Company brought the case here. The decrees of both courts were reversed, and the case remanded to the circuit court, with directions to remand the case to the state court. This was decreed on the ground that, by the statement of the complainant's (telegraph company) own case, it was not brought 'within the category of cases arising under the laws or Constitution of the United States.' We said that the bill was in effect for the specific performance of a contract. 'It is not argued,' we said, by the Chief Justice, 'by counsel for the telegraph company that the telegraph company had any right under the statute, and independently of the contract, to maintain and operate this telegraph line over the railroad company's property; and it has been long settled that that statute did not confer on telegraph compaines the rights to enter on private property without the consent of the owner, and erect the necessary structures for their busi- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 564]\n\u00a0\n ness; but it does provide that, whenever the consent of the owner is obtained, no state legislation shall prevent the occupation of post roads for telegraph purposes by such corporations as are willing to avail themselves of its privileges.'\n And further: 'As we have said, it was not asserted in argument that the telegraph company had the right, independently of the contract, to maintain its line on the railroad company's property, and, in view of the settled construction of the statute, we could not permit such a contention to be recognized as the basis of jurisdiction.' In other words, by the decision in the Pensacola Case no such Federal question remained to be based on the act of 1866.\n Counsel, however, pronounce the extracts quoted from the Pensacola Case and their repetition in the Ann Arbor Case as dicto, and urge, besides, that the irresistible logic of other cases overthrows the authority of both. Neither proposition is tenable. We have said enough to demonstrate that the language we have quoted was the deliberate resolution of the court, and we might content ourselves by observing that, as the Ann Arbor Case is the last expression of this court interpreting the act of 1866, prior cases, if not reconcilable with its exposition of that act, are superseded. We think they are so reconcilable.\n One of the cases which is relied on (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n125 U.S. 530\n, 31 L. ed. 790, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 961, asserted the very valuable right obtained by telegraph companies under the act of 1866, and vindicated it against a statute of Massachusetts, which provided for an injunction against the prosecution of business by the company as a means of enforcing the payment of taxes. This is the very essence of the effect given to the act of 1866 by the Pensacola and Ann Arbor Cases. The telegraph company was in occupation of the post roads of the state of Massachusetts, whether railroads or the ordinary highways does not appear. Its right to be there was not controverted, and how it got there was of no consequence. Its right to do business after and during such occupation was \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 565]\n\u00a0\n involved and was decided, and to this right the language of the court was addressed, and receives limitation from it. The language of the court was substantially the same as that of the act of Congress. It enforced the right given by that act, and gave to the telegraph company the protection of the national power and supremacy, and differs only in the instance, not in the principle, declared in the Pensacola Case. The telegraph company, indeed, sought for more than the mere exercise of a right. It sought to turn the act of 1866 from a mere permission to exercise a right to the creation of such an instrumentality of the national government as to be exempt from state taxation. The court rejected that view.\n So also must be limited the language in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Texas, \n105 U.S. 460\n, 26 L. ed. 1067, and United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n160 U.S. 1\n, 40 L. ed. 319, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190. In the first the distinction which was necessary to make was between intra and inter-state commerce, and to determine what rights as to the latter were conferred by the act of 1866. In the second case the efficacy of the act to prevent binding contracts against its policy was involved. The case called for that, but no more, as far as the act of 1866 was concerned. Such an agreement was set up, and under it the Western Union Telegraph Company claimed the right to exclude all other telegraph companies from the roadway of the railway company, notwithstanding the act of 1866. Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, said that such an agreement 'directly tended to make the act of July 24, 1866, ineffectual, and was, therefore, hostile to the object contemplated by Congress. Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 24 S. L. ed. 708, 711.'\n We need not dissent from these views, or qualify the general language by which they were amplified and supported. Whatever rights were granted by the act of 1866 were granted to all telegraph companies, and could not be defeated by a binding contract with some one company; nor could such an agreement be used to evade or escape the commands of the statute \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 566]\n\u00a0\n constituting the Union Pacific Railway, passed in 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 489, chap. 120], or the supplementary act of 1888 [25 Stat. at L. 382, chap. 772, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3583], which was passed by virtue of a power reserved in the act of 1862. The suit was brought to enforce the duties and obligations imposed by those statutes on the railway company. The statutes are quoted in the opinion, and the act of 1866 is referred to only as reinforcing the provisions of the statute of 1862. It was only necessary, therefore, to declare the policy of the act of 1866 as a grant of rights to all telegraph companies. The consideration of the court was not directed to anything else. The extent of the rights granted as presented in the case at bar could not have been in contemplation. They were not in issue, and it could not have been intended to anticipate and decide the controversies which might be based upon them.\n St. Louis v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n148 U.S. 93\n, 37 L. ed. 381, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485, is also urged by the telegraph company as inconsistent with the Ann Arbor Case. It is clearly not so. The case involved the validity of a charge or rental made by the city of St. Louis for the use of its streets by the telegraph company. The charge was imposed by the same ordinance that gave permission to the telegraph company to occupy the streets of the city. The telegraph company resisted the charge upon several grounds, among which were the provisions of the act of 1866, and its acceptance by the company. The charge was held to be a valid one, but on no ground which involved the consideration of the right of the telegraph company to occupy the streets. The right was not disputed. The ordinance of the city conferred it. The claim made under the act of 1866 was that it exempted the telegraph company from a payment of any compensation. But compensation was decreed on the ground that the franchise or privilege granted by the act of 1866 could only be exercised in subordination to public as well as private rights, and, as entry upon the latter could only be made upon the payment of just compensation, entry upon the former was subject to the same payment. This was all that was necessary to decide to sustain the charge made by the \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 567]\n\u00a0\n city. In other words, it was all that was necessary to decide to meet the extreme contention made by the telegraph company, that under the act of 1866 it was entitled to occupy the streets without charge, notwithstanding its occupation was exclusive and permanent, as the court said it was. It is manifest, to hold that there can be no entry upon property without payment of compensation is not to decide that such entry can be made upon tender of compensation. Certainly, as to private property or rights, the nonconsent of the owner is a factor to be dealt with. Nonconsent, if resolute, can only be overcome by power conferred by law; in other words, by the exercise of eminent domain. The act of 1866 was not considered in that regard.\n By this review of the cases it is evident that there is no inconsistency between them and the Pensacola Case and the Ann Arbor Case, and we are brought to the discussion of the general considerations urged against the latter cases. Construed as they construe the act of 1866, it becomes meaningless, counsel say. If the act grants no rights, it is urged, except by permission of the railroad companies, it confers no more than can be obtained from the railroad companies. The objection is best answered by examples. The telegraph company had such permission in the Pensacola Case. It needed, however, the act of 1866 to make its exercise effectual against the legislation of the state of Florida. In the Union Pacific Case a claim of a monopoly by one telegraph company was answered by the act construed as a grant of rights to all companies. These examples show important results achieved by the act, and the principles of the cases may come to be applied to prevent other hostile action of states or individuals.\n This court, when it came to consider the act of 1866 in the Pensacola Case, was confronted, as we are confronted now, with the serious nature of the right of eminent domain. It is indeed 'inseparable from sovereignty,' but it is accompanied and restrained by inexorable limitations. The property taken must be for a public use, and there must be com- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 568]\n\u00a0\n pensation made for it, and compensation, whether it be regarded as part of the power or a limitation upon the power, is so far essential that the absence of a provision for it has been regarded as important in determining the intention of the legislature when a grant of such power is claimed. 1 Lewis, Em. Dom.  240, and cases cited. We said in Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 U.S. 399\n, 40 L. ed. 196, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48, by Mr. Justice Harlan: 'It is a condition precedent to the exercise of such power [ eminent domain] that the statute make provision for reasonable compensation to the owner.' Many state cases were cited, and also Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 U.S. 641\n, 34 L. ed. 295, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965. The act of Congress under review in the latter case, it was contended, did not provide for compensation for the property taken. In reply, Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court, said: 'The objection to the act cannot be sustained. The Constitution declares that private property shall not be taken 'for public use without just compensation.' It does not provide or require that compensation shall be actually paid in advance of the occupancy of the land to be taken. But the owner is entitled to reasonable, certain, and adequate provision for obtaining compensation before his occupancy is disturbed. Whether a particular provision be sufficient to secure the compensation to which, under the Constitution, he is entitled, is sometimes a question of difficulty.' The requirements of the Constitution were held to be fully met because the act which was under consideration provided that, before the railway which was authorized should be constructed through any of the lands proposed to be taken, full compensation should be made to the onwer for all property taken, or damage done by reason of the construction of the road, and in the event of an appeal from the finding of the referee the railway company should pay into court double the amount of the award to abide the judgment.\n In Kohl v. United States, \n91 U.S. 367\n, 23 L. ed. 449, acts of Congress were considered, one providing for the acquisition of a site \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 569]\n\u00a0\n for a public building, the other an appropriation act. The appropriation made by the latter was 'for the purchase, at a private sale or by condemnation, of ground for a site' for the building. The real controversy in the case was whether the acts of Congress intended the site to be obtained under the authority of the state government in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, or by the United States government in its own right and by virtue of its own eminent domain. The court held the latter, and, commenting on the sufficiency of the acts to give the right, said: 'The authority here given [the first act] was to purchase. If that were all, it might be doubted whether the right of eminent domain was intended to be invoked. . . . That Congress intended more than this is evident, however, in view of the subsequent and amendatory act passed June 10, 1872 [ 17 Stat. at L. 352, chap. 415, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2457], which made an appropriation 'for the purchase, at private sale or by condemnation, of the ground for a site' for the building.'\n But in the act of July, 1866, there is not a word which provides for condemnation or compensation. The rule that when a right is given all the means of exercising it are given does not, as we have seen, apply to the extent contended for by the telegraph company. The exercise of the power of eminent domain is against common right. It subverts the usual attributes of the ownership of property. It must, therefore, be given in express terms or by necessary implication; and this was the reasoning in the Pensacola Case, and applied directly to the act of 1866. We may repeat the language of the court: 'If private property is required it must, so far as the present legislation is concerned, be obtained by private arrangement with its owner. No compulsory proceedings are authorized.'\n In Sweet v. Rechel, Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., and Kohl v. United States, the property to which the constitutional protection was applied was property in private use. Their doctrine applies as well to private property devoted to a public use. There is no difference whatever in principle arising from the difference in the uses. \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 570]\n\u00a0\n A railroad right of way is a very substantial thing. It is more than a mere right of passage. It is more than an easement. We discussed its character in New Mexico v. United States Trust Co. \n172 U.S. 171\n, 43 L. ed. 407, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 128. We there said that if a railroad's right of way was an easement it was 'one having the attributes of the fee, perpetuity and exclusive use and possession; also the remedies of the fee, and, like it, corporeal, not incorporeal, property.' And we drew support for this from a New Jersey case, in which state the rights of way in the case at bar are situated. We quoted New York, S. & W. R. Co. v. Trimmer, 53 N. J. L. 1, 3, 20 Atl. 761, as follows: 'Unlike the use of a private way,-that is, discontinuous,-the use of land condemned by a railroad company is perpetual and continuous.' And it is held in Pennsylvania 'that a railway company is a purchaser, in consideration of public accommodation and convenience, of the exclusive possession of the ground paid for to the proprietors of it.' Philadelphia & R. R. Co. v. Hummell, 44 Pa. 375, 84 Am. Dec. 457. It is 'a fee in the surface and so much beneath as may be necessary for support. . . . But whatever it may be called, it is, in substance, an interest in the land, special and exclusive in its nature.' Pennsylvania S. Valley R. Co. v. Reading Paper Mills, 149 Pa. 18, 4 Atl. 205; Philadelphia v. Ward, 174 Pa. 45, 34 Atl. 458; Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. O. R. Co. v. Peet, 152 Pa. 488, 19 L. R. A. 467, 25 Atl. 612.\n A railroad's right of way has, therefore, the substantiality of the fee, and it is private property, even to the public, in all else but an interest and benefit in its uses. It cannot be invaded without guilt of trespass. It cannot be appropriated in whole or part except upon the payment of compensation. In other words, it is entitled to the protection of the Constitution, and in the precise manner in which protection is given. It can only be taken by the exercise of the powers of eminent domain; and a condition precedent to the exercise of such power is, we said in Sweet v. Rechel, that the statute conferring it make provision for reasonable compensation to the owner of the property taken. This condition is expressed \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 571]\n\u00a0\n with even more emphasis in Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co.\n A few words more may be necessary to avoid all possible misunderstanding of the purpose for which we have cited those cases and Kohl v. United States. We have cited them, not as tests of the validity of the act of 1866, but as tests of its meaning, supporting the authority of the Pensacola Case and Ann Arbor Case. We have no occasion to consider the validity of the act of 1866 as an attempt to grant the power of eminent domain. We decide the act to be an exercise by Congress of its power to withdraw from state interference interstate commerce by telegraph. As such, of course, the act is an efficient and constitutional enactment.\n Certain cases decided at circuit are cited for our consideration, and we will close this branch of our discussion by a brief review of them.\n In Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Oregon Short Line R. Co. 104 Fed. 623, and Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Oregon Short Line R. Co. 114 Fed. 787, there were views expressed favorable to the contentions made in the case at bar by the telegraph company, but the judgments in both cases were ultimately rested upon the local statutes,-Idaho and Montana,-which granted the right of eminent domain to telegraph companies. We may also observe that the first case went to the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit. That court sustained the judgment of the circuit court, upon the statute of Idaho and upon general legal principles. It did not refer to the act of 1866. 49 C. C. A. 663, 111 Fed. 843.\n In Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Southern R. Co. 89 Fed. 190, and Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. 94 Fed. 234, the act of 1866 was more directly passed on. Both cases were proceedings in eminent domain,-one brought in the courts of North Carolina and removed to the circuit court of the United States; the other brought in the circuit court of the United States for the \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 572]\n\u00a0\n northern district of Ohio. In passing on the sufficiency of the petition in the first case, Judge Simonton said that the right of petitioner to construct its lines along the right of way of post roads of the United States was given under the act of Congress of 1866; but, he observed, the mode or method of exercising the right conferred was fixed by the laws of the several states, and it was exclusive in its character in ascertaining the amount of compensation to be allowed. The right of the telegraph company was, therefore, considered and adjudged under the North Carolina statutes.\n In the second case a motion was made to dismiss on the ground that the power of eminent domain was not conferred by any law of the United States or the state of Ohio. The motion was sustained. District Judge Ricks said: 'The act of July 24, 1866, made no provision for compensation or payment for property to be taken; hence the procedure cannot be sustained by virtue of that act.' He cited the Pensacola Case, \n96 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 24 S. L. ed. 708, 711.\n Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. 33 C. C. A. 113, 61 U. S. App. 741, 90 Fed. 379, and St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. v. western U. Teleg. Co. 55 C. C. A. 263, 118 Fed. 497, were respectively decided by the circuit court of appeals of the sixth circuit and the circuit court of appeals of the eighth circuit. It is difficult to reconcile them. In one it was decided, following the authority of the Pensacola Case, that the telegraph company could not occupy the line of the defendant's railroad without its consent or that of some predecessor in title. This was wanting. In the other it was conceded that the right of entry upon private property was not conferred by the act of 1866, without the owner's consent, yet held that, as consent had been given, no reason could be perceived why a court of equity should compel a removal of the telegraph company's lines from the railway's right of way,-'especially where it appears that no express agreement was made that they should be removed when its lines were erected.' \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 573]\n\u00a0\n 2. It is contended by the telegraph company that the charters under which the several railway companies constituting the system of the railroad company were organized expressly created them 'public highways,' and that in the acquisition of land for their purposes they were public agents, 'and the land was taken by the government, and in the eye of the law as completely subject to public uses as though it had been taken by the state itself,'-that is to say, if we understand the argument, have become highways in the full sense of that word. And counsel further say the difference between them and ordinary highways 'is not a legal difference, but is the difference of the kind of use to which the highway is subject,-in the one case, wheel vehicles drawn by horses; in the other, to steam vehicles drawn by locomotives along and upon iron rails.' They are subject, therefore, it is urged, as ordinary highways and streets of a city are subject, to the control of Congress by virtue of its power over interstate commerce.\n Counsel in advancing the argument exhibits a consciousness of taking an extreme position. It would seem, certainly if considered with other parts of their argument, to make a railroad right of way public property. To that extreme we cannot go, for the reasons which we have already indicated. The right of way of a railroad is property devoted to a public use, and has often been called a highway, and as such is subject, to a certain extent, to state and Federal control; and for this many cases may be cited. But it has always been recognized, as we have pointed out, that a railroad right of way is so far private property as to be entitled to that provision of the Constitution which forbids its taking, except under the power of eminent domain and upon payment of compensation. The right of way of a railroad was recognized as private property in the Pensacola Case, and we are brought back to the main question,-the interpretation of the act of July, 1866, and upon that we have sufficiently dilated.\n It follows from these views that the act of 1866 does not \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 574]\n\u00a0\n grant the right to telegraph companies to enter upon and occupy the rights of way of railroad companies, except with the consent of the latter, or grant the power of eminent domain. Nor does the statute of New Jersey make those rights of way public property so as to subject them to such occupation under the provisions of the act of 1866.\n It is admitted that the statutes of New Jersey do not confer the right of eminent domain upon the telegraph company.\n\n 3. \nIn view of our conclusion, it is not necessary to consider the question whether, if the power of eminent domain were granted by the act of 1866, it would be within the competency of a court of equity to ascertain compensation, or that compensation might be determined at law. That question was pertinent in Kohl v. United States. It is not pertinent in this case. The acts of Congress passed on in Kohl v. United States, as we have seen, provided for the appropriation of a site for a public building by purchase or by condemnation. By the act of 1866 power of condemnation is not given, and, of course, methods of procedure are not involved in its construction.\n It is equally unnecessary to consider the questions which might arise if the state of New Jersey gave the right of eminent domain to the telegraph company. It is conceded by counsel that such right does not exist, and it happens that under the policy of New Jersey the right of way of the railroad company enjoys in that state immunity from compulsory proceedings instituted by the telegraph company. But this has no bearing on the act of 1866, nor does it make that act, as construed by us, a grant to railroads of greater power over commercial intercourse by telegraph than the states have. Indeed, we think, a comparison between the states and railroads in that regard is misleading, and overlooks the essential difference between restraints on the legislative power of the states and the rights of property.\n On account of those restraints, it may be, and finding no \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 575]\n\u00a0\n impediment in the rights of property, interstate commerce by telegraph has marched to a splendid development, although in the acquisition of the means for its exercise it has relied on the consent of the owner of private property, or the power of eminent domain conferred by the states. We cannot but feel, therefore, that there is something inadequate in the argument which is based on the apprehension that the act of July 24, 1866, construed as we construe it gives a sinister power to railroad companies. It gives no power to those companies but that which appertains to the ownership of their property.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n In view of the importance of these cases I do not feel that any dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court should be expressed unless the grounds of such dissent be fully disclosed.\n The controlling question before the court is whether the Western Union Telegraph Company is entitled, in virtue of any existing acts of Congress, to keep and maintain its telegraph lines upon the right of way of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, assuming that the ordinary travel on that road will not be thereby interfered with.\n Congress, having power to establish postoffices and post roads, has declared all railroads in operation within the limits of the United States to be post roads and post routes. 5 Stat. at L. 283, chap. 172; 10 Stat. at L. 255, chap. 146; Rev. Stat.  3964, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2707; 23 Stat. at L. 3, chap. 9, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2708.\n There was, for many years, as all know, and therefore as the court may judicially know, a widespread belief that the government and the people of the country were at great disavantage in matters of business and intercourse as involved \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 576]\n\u00a0\n in the use of the telegraph. The conviction was strong and universal that the control of the post roads of the country was being exerted by great railroad corporations in such way as to subserve private and corporate interests at the expense of the United States and without any regard for the convenience of the general public. As a remedy for those evils Congress passed the act of July 24th, 1866, entitled 'An Act to Aid in the Construction of Telegraph Lines, and to Secure to the Government the Use of the Same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes.' 14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3579. By that act Congress conferred upon any telegraph company organized under the laws of any state 'the right to construct, maintain, and operate lines of telegraph,' not only through and over the public domain, and over, under, or across the navigable streams or waters of the United States, but 'over and along any of the military or post roads of the United States.' By the same act it is declared that on the lines of such companies telegraphic communication between the several departments of the government should be at rates to be annually fixed by the Postmaster General, and have priority over all other business.  2. To the exercise of the right thus given, Congress annexed several conditions, but the only one pertinent to the present discussion is the condition that the telegraph lines erected by any company accepting the provisions of the act should be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct the navigation of the navigable streams and waters of the United States, or 'interfere with the ordinary travel on such military or post roads.'\n The object of the act, this court has said, all its members concurring, 'was not only to promote and secure the interests of the government, but to obtain for the benefit of the people of the entire country every advantage in the matter of communication by telegraph which might come from competition between corporations of different states;' that 'it was very far from the intention of Congress, by any legislation, to so exert its power as to enable one telegraph corporation, Federal \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 577]\n\u00a0\n or state, to acquire exclusive rights over any post road;' and that 'no railroad company operating a post road of the United States over which interstate commerce is carried on can consistently with the act of July 24th, 1866, bind itself by agreement to exclude from its roadway any telegraph company incorporated under the laws of a state, which accepts the provisions of that act, and desires to use such roadway for its line in such manner as will not interfere with the ordinary travel thereon.' United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n160 \nU.S. 1, 44\n, 49 S., 40 L. ed. 319, 334, 336, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, 206, 208. Yet, by its present construction of the act of 1866 the court-if we do not misapprehend its opinion-holds that the right which that act gives to construct, maintain, and operate a telegraph line upon a post road cannot, in virtue of that act, or under any existing legislation, be exercised by the Western Union Telegraph Company, against the will of the railroad company operating such road; and this, notwithstanding it be absolutely clear that the occupancy of the post road by the telegraph lines of the particular company proposing or desiring to erect them would not, in the slightest degree, interfere with the ordinary travel on such road. It is now held, in effect, that, so far as that act is concerned, and despite its explicit provisions, even the government cannot, except with the assent of the railroad company, enjoy the advantages sought to be secured by its passage. I think it was intended by the act of 1866, in the interest of the postal service and of interstate trade and intercourse, to throw open all the post roads of the country to the use of telegraph companies accepting its provisions, subject to the condition that such use should not interfere with ordinary travel on the post roads so occupied. And that intention is in harmony with the doctrine often announced by this court, that 'a railroad is a public highway, established primarily for the convenience of the people and to subserve public ends, and therefore subject to governmental control.' Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 \nU.S. 641, 657\n, 34 S. L. ed. 295, 302, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965; Olcott v. Fon du Lac County, 16 \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 578]\n\u00a0\n Wall. 678, 694, 21 L. ed. 382, 388; United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25; Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115.\n But it is suggested that the telegraph company has not been expressly invested with the power of eminent domain. Nevertheless, it has been given, by express words, the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines on any post road of the United States; and, as it is not contended that Congress has exceeded its power in granting that right, the question is whether the right so given can be made effective by any mode of procedure known to our jurisprudence. I have always supposed it to be competent for a court of the United States having general jurisdiction of suits at law and in equity, in some efficient mode, by some process or form of procedure, to enforce and protect any right constitutionally conferred by the legislative department. The principle is illustrated in D. M. Osborne & Co. v. Missouri P. R. Co. \n147 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 37 S. L. ed. 155, 161, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299, 303, which was an action to enjoin the construction of a track along a public street, because of irreparable damage to be thereby inflicted on the plaintiff. This court, following the decision of Judge Brewer, now of this court, in McElroy v. Kansas City, 21 Fed. 257, said: 'If the defendant had an ultimate right to do the act sought to be restrained, but only upon some condition precedent, and compliance with the condition was within the power of the defendant, the injunction would almost universally be granted until the condition was complied with; but, if the means of complying with the condition were not at defendant's command, then the court would adjust its order so as to give complainant the substantial benefit of the condition while not restraining defendant from the exercise of its ultimate rights. Inasmuch as, while the statutes of Missouri provided for the assessment of damages resulting from the taking of property for public use, there existed no provision to attain that result where the property was merely damaged, an injunction was granted, with leave to the defendant to apply for the appointment of a board of commissioners to ascertain and report the damages which complainant would \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 579]\n\u00a0\n sustain, upon payment of which the injunction would be vacated.' This principle was recognized in the recent case of New York v. Pine, \n185 U.S. 93\n, 46 L. ed. 820, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592.\n It is said by counsel that the right given by the act of 1866 is necessarily subject to the condition prescribed by the constitutional provision that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation, and that the property interest of the railroad company in its right of way cannot be permanently taken from it for public purposes, against its will, without making such compensation.\n Upon the subject of compensation the court reproduces from the opinion in Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380, 399\n, 40 S. L. ed. 188, 196, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43, 48, this detached sentence: 'It is a condition precedent to the exercise of such power [eminent domain] that the statute make provision for reasonable compensation to the owner.' But the court does not apply any such rule to the present case, and holds that the act of 1866 is invalid as not making provision for compensation. Besides, the above sentence, taken in connection with the one immediately preceding it, shows clearly that what was said had reference to the taking of private property for public use without provision being made in the statute for compensation. The entire paragraph from which the above sentence was taken reads: 'When, however, the legislature provides for the actual taking and appropriation of private property for public uses, its authority to enact such a regulation rests upon its right of eminent domain,-a right vital to the existence and safety of government. But it is a condition precedent to the exercise of such power that the statute make provision for reasonable compensation to the owner.' What was said in Sweet v. Rechel plainly had no reference to property of a public or quasi public nature. The same observations may be made in reference to the quotation made from Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 U.S. 641\n, 34 L. ed. 295, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965. What was said in that case had also reference to the taking of private property. If the court were now of opinion that the act of 1866 was invalid as \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 580]\n\u00a0\n not making provision for compensation, then the object of citing Sweet v. Rechel and Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. would be both manifest and appropriate. But the court does not hold that the act of 1866 is objectionable on any such ground. On the contrary, it holds a railroad right of way to be private property, and yet, despite its citation of the above cases, recognizes the validity of the act, although it makes no provision for compensation to the owner. It may not be appropriate for me to say that I adhere to what was said in Sweet v. Sechel and Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., the opinions in both of which cases were written by myself, speaking for the court. Whether a railroad right of way over a post road of the United States-such road being a public highway established primarily for the public convenience and subject to governmental control-is private property within the rule that a statute authorizing private property to be taken for public use must make provision for compensation, is a question not wholly free from doubt, and it need not be here discussed; for the court does not hold that the act of 1866 is subject to that objection.\n But let it be granted, for the purposes of this case, that a railroad company has such a property interest in its right of way that it is entitled to compensation if such right of way be appropriated to the use of a telegraph company accepting the act of 1866; still, the question remains, In what way or by what mode may such compensation be legally ascertained? May it not be ascertained by a court of general jurisdiction, when all parties in interest are regularly being brought in? Here the telegraph company comes into the circuit court of the United States, and seeks, in virtue of the act of Congress, to enforce the right expressly granted to it, of occupying the post road in question with its lines. It expresses its readiness to make such compensation to the railroad company as the law requires, and informs the court that it has instituted an action at law to ascertain the amount of such compensation. The bill alleges: \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 581]\n\u00a0\n 'Your orator says further that it is diligently prosecuting said action on the law side of this court for the ascertainment of the amount of compensation to the said railway companies defendant herein, for the right to the use of said railroads to maintain and operate its telegraph line along and over the lines of said railways as prescribed in said act of Congress of July 24th, 1866; and that it will continue to prosecute the same to a final determination as rapidly as the business in said court will permit the said cause to be heard and determined, and without any unnecessary delay.'\n'Your orator prays that this court ascertain, order, adjudge, and decree the amount of compensation to be paid by your orator to the defendants, as their rights may severally appear, for the construction, maintenance, and operation of your orator's telegraph lines over and along the right of way of the defendants' said railroads, under the terms, provisions, and restrictions of said acts of Congress hereinbefore mentioned, or, if this court shall order and determine that the amount of such compensation to the defendants shall be such amount as shall be determined or adjudged in the said action at law, that upon due payment of such compensation by your orator to the defendants this court will order, adjudge, and decree that your orator is entitled to a perpetual injunction against the defendants herein and each of them, restraining them and each of them from in any manner interfering with the location, construction, maintenance, and operation of your orator's said lines of telegraph upon the roadway or right of way of the said defendants, under and subject to the provisions and restrictions of the said act of Congress of July 24th, 1866, and meanwhile and until the final decree of this court that a temporary injunction be issued against the defendants, prohibiting and restraining them and each of them from in any manner interfering with the use and operation of the telegraph lines of your orator upon the said roadway and right of way of the defendants pending the determination of the said action at law, or until the further order of this court in the premises. \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 582]\n\u00a0\n And for such other and further relief as the case may require and to your honors may seem just.'\n\n Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367, 375\n, 376 S., 23 L. ed. 449, 452, 453, was an application filed in pursuance of acts of Congress authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase a site for a public building. A site was selected, but the Secretary and private owners could not agree as to price, and the acts of Congress did not direct the particular mode by which the land should be condemned and the compensation to be made by the government ascertained. The Secretary of the Treasury, in order to carry out the will of Congress, did not institute formal proceedings of condemnation, as one of the acts, under which he proceeded, authorized him to do. But he instituted a suit in a circuit court of the United States to appropriate a certain parcel of land for the proposed building. It was objected that the circuit court was without jurisdiction, but that objection was overruled. It was contended in argument that, while the United States had the right of eminent domain, Congress had not given to the circuit court jurisdiction of a proceeding for the condemnation of property brought by the United States in the assertion or enforcement of that right; and that the act of Congress meant that the land for the proposed public building was to be obtained under the authority of the state government, in the exercise of its right of eminent domain. It was further contended that if the proceeding was properly instituted in the circuit court, then the act of Congress required that it should conform to the provisions of the state law in a like proceeding in the state court. This court said: 'Doubtless Congress might have provided a mode of taking the land and determining the compensation to be made, which would have been exclusive of all other modes. They might have prescribed in what tribunal or by what agents the taking and the ascertainment of the just compensation should be accomplished. The mode might have been by a commission, or it might have been referred expressly to the circuit court; but this, we think, was not necessary. The investment of the \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 583]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Treasury with power to obtain the land by condemnation, without prescribing the mode of exercising the power, gave him also the power to obtain it by any means that were competent to adjudge a condemnation . . . It is quite immaterial that Congress has not enacted that the compensation shall be ascertained in a judicial proceeding. That ascertainment is in its nature at least quasi judicial. Certainly no other mode than a judicial trial has been provided. . . . But there is no special provision for ascertaining the just compensation to be made for land taken. That is left to the ordinary processes of the law; and hence, as the government is a suitor for the property under a claim of legal right to take it, there appears to be no reason for holding that the proper circuit court has not jurisdiction of the suit under the general grant of jurisdiction made by the act of 1789.'\n In United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 518\n, 519 S., 27 L. ed. 1015, 1017, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 346, which was a proceeding to condemn property for the use of the United States, this court, referring to a certain proposition advanced by counsel, said: 'There is in this position an assumption that the ascertainment of the amount of compensation to be made is an essential element of the power of appropriation; but such is not the case. The power to take private property for public uses, generally termed the right of eminent domain, belongs to every independent government. It is an incident of sovereignty, and, as said in Mississippi & R. River Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 25 L. ed. 206, requires no constitutional recognition. The provision found in the 5th Amendment to the Federal Constitution and in the Constitutions of the several states, for just compensation for the property taken, is merely a limitation upon the use of the power. It is no part of the power itself, but a condition upon which the power may be exercised. . . . But there is no reason why the compensation to be made may not be ascertained by any appropriate tribunal capable of estimating the value of the property. There is nothing in the nature of the matter to be determined which calls for the establishment of any special tribunal by the \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 584]\n\u00a0\n appropriating power. The proceeding for theascertainment of the value of the property and consequent compensation to be made is merely an inquisition to establish a particular fact as a preliminary to the actual taking; and it may be prosecuted before the commissioners, or special boards, or the courts, with or without the intervention of a jury, as the legislative power may designate. All that is required is that it shall be conducted in some fair and just manner, with opportunity to the owners of the property to present evidence as to its value, and to be heard thereon.'\n The vital object of the present suit was to secure the recognition and enforcement of the right of the telegraph company, under the act of 1866, to keep and maintain its lines upon the railroad's right of way. If it had such a right,-the authority to confer the right is, we repeat, not disputed,-then this suit in equity was an appropriate mode by which the right could be adequately protected and compensation secured to the railroad company. To assert the right and to ask that the amount of compensation shall be ascertained made the proceeding a suit or controversy within the meaning of the judiciary acts, and made the case one-in legal effect-for condemnation. I perceive no reason why the court, in advance of a final decree recognizing and enforcing that right, could not have instituted, as it was asked to do, an inquiry in respect of the compensation which the railroad company was entitled to receive for the proposed use of its right of way, and have made the payment of such compensation a condition precedent to the exercise by the telegraph company of the right given by the act of 1866. Having all the parties interested before it, could not the court have directed a jury to be impaneled to inquire, under the direction of the court, as to the amount of compensation to be paid to the railroad company? Could it have done any more under regular proceedings of condemnation? Instead of adopting that course, the circuit court proceeded upon the ground that even if the use of the defendant's road by the telegraph company would not interfere with ordinary travel on and \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 585]\n\u00a0\n over it, it was compelled by the former decisions of this court to hold that neither in virtue of the act of 1866, nor of any other existing Federal statute, could the telegraph company occupy the railroad's right of way without the consent of the railroad company.\n The cases in this court which, it is supposed, adopted this view of the act of 1866, are Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 U.S. 1\n, 24 L. ed. 708, and Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 44 S. L. ed. 1052, 1054, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867. But the utmost ingenuity is inadequate to show that the present question was involved in either of those cases, or that the decision in either case depended in the slightest degree on its solution.\n It appears from the Pensacola Case that the Western Union Telegraph Company had the right to place and operate its lines upon the right of way of a certain railroad company between points in Alabama and points in Florida. There was no controversy in that case between the railroad company and the telegraph company as to the right of the latter to have its lines on the railroad right of way. The railroad company, as the report of the case shows, had consented to the occupancy of its right of way by the lines of the telegraph company, and that fact was not disputed. The railroad company was not even a party to the suit. It had no quarrel with the telegraph company. What need, then, had the court to consider the rights of the Western Union Telegraph Company, under the act of 1866, when it was conceded that that company had the consent of the railroad company to occupy its right of way? This view of the case was distinctly announced by this court when it said in the Pensacola Case that 'the present case is satisfied if we find that Congress has power, by appropriate legislation, to prevent the states from placing obstructions in the way of its [the telegraph's] usefulness.' The sole question in the case was as to the validity of a Florida statute, under which a Florida telegraph company was given exclusive telegraphic rights over the route to be occupied by the Western Union Telegraph Company with the consent of the railroad \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 586]\n\u00a0\n company; and the charter of the Florida company authorized it to locate and construct its lines within certain named counties of Florida, 'along and upon any public road or highway, or across any water, or upon any railroad or private property for which permission shall first have been obtained from the proprietors thereof.' This court held that the attempt of the state to exercise exclusive control over telegraphic communications between it and other states was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and that the Florida statute was void so far as it assumed to grant exclusive privileges to a particular telegraph company.\n Referring to the act of 1866 the court said: 'It substantially declares, in the interest of commerce and the convenient transmission of intelligence from place to place by the government of the United States and its citizens, that th erection of telegraph lines shall, so far as state interference is concerned, be free to all who will submit to the conditions imposed by Congress, and that corporations organized under the laws of one state for constructing and operating telegraph lines shall not be excluded by another from prosecuting their business within its jurisdiction, if they accept the terms proposed by the national government for this national privilege. To this extent, certainly, the statute is a legitimate regulation of commercial intercourse among the states, and is appropriate legislation to carry into execution the powers of Congress over the postal service. It gives no foreign corporations the right to enter upon private property without the consent of the owner, and erect the necessary structures for its business; but it does provide that, whenever the consent of the owner is obtained, no state legislation shall prevent the occupation of post roads for telegraph purposes by such corporations as are willing to avail themselves of its privileges.' What was meant by the words, 'but it [the act] does provide that, whenever the consent of the owner is obtained,' I cannot understand. The act of 1866 does not contain any such provision, nor anything like it. Not a single word is to be found in it \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 587]\n\u00a0\n that refers to the consent of the owner of the property to be taken. The court proceeds: 'It is insisted, however, that the statute extends only to such military and post roads as are upon the public domain; but this, we think, is not so. The language is, 'through and over any portion of the public domain of the United States, over and along any of the military or post roads of the United States, which have been or may hereafter be declared such by act of Congress, and over, under, or across the navigable streams or waters of the United States.' There is nothing to indicate an intention of limiting the effect of the words employed, and they are, therefore, to be given their natural and ordinary signification. Read in this way, the grant evidently extends to the public domain, the military and post roads, and the navigable waters of the United States. These are all within the dominion of the mational government to the extent of the national powers, and are, therefore, subject to legitimate congressional regulation. No question arises as to the authority of Congress to provide for the appropriation of private property to the uses of the telegraph, for no such attempt has been made. The use of public property alone is granted. If private property is required, it must, so far as the present legislation is concerned, be obtained by private arrangement with its owner. No compulsory proceedings are authorized. State sovereignty under the Constitution is not interfered with. Only national privileges are granted.'\n This language, it seems to me, has not been correctly interpreted. Undue stress has been laid upon the words 'private property without the consent of the owner,' and the words 'private property . . . obtained by private arrangement with its owner.' They have been so interpreted as to make the court decide a question not before it, not necessary to the decision, not involved in the issues made, and never suggested by counsel. The briefs of counsel in that case show that no such question was in their minds; for they as well as the court knew, from the record before them, and as we may know from an examination of that record, that the Western Union Com- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 588]\n\u00a0\n pany was entitled, so far as the consent of the railroad company was concerned, to maintain its lines on the railroad right of way. Upon the above-quoted words the contention is based that the court intended to decide that no railroad right of way could, in virtue of the act of 1866 be occupied by any telegraph company without the consent of the railroad company first obtained. I cannot believe that any such question was intended to be decised. As already shown, the court expressly said that the only question to be decided was whether Congress had power to prevent a state from obstructing interstate telegraphic communications, by granting exclusive privileges to a particular telegraph company of its own creation. It is a mistake to say that the court declared that the sole purpose of the act of 1866 was to prevent state monopolies, or that the act was merely an exercise of national power to forbid state interference with telegraphic communications. It did say that the case then before the court would be satisfied if the question as to state interference was decided, that is, that the case involved no other question. Besides, the whole context of the opinion in the Pensacola Case shows that the court did not include railroad property employed in commerce when it used the above-quoted words. It was argued in that case that the act of 1866 had reference only to the 'public domain,' that is, to the public lands owned by the United States. This view was distinctly rejected, and post roads were placed by the court, so far as the privileges granted by the act were concerned, on the same plane as the public domain, so that not even a state could interfere with the national privilege granted by Congress, if the telegraph company accepted the terms of the act. The court said that any telegraphic company accepting the provisions of the act could put its lines on any post road, if ordinary travel thereon was not interfered with, and that not even the state could stand in the way. It then added, as if out of abundant caution, and to show that Congress had no purpose to interfere with the rights of private owners, that no attempt was made by Congress to provide for \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 589]\n\u00a0\n the appropriation of private property, and that 'the use of public property alone is granted.' That meant that the act had not granted any right to telegraph companies to occupy private property with telegraph lines. Having said that the act granted the use of post roads for telegraphic purposes, that it embraced the use of such roads equally with the public domain, and that 'the use of public property alone is granted,' it is inconceivable that the court employed in the same connection the words 'private property' as embracing post roads, or the use of such roads. To relieve the minds of those who apprehended danger arising from the act of 1866 to state sovereignty and to rights that were strictly private, the court took care to say that neither state sovereignty nor private rights were interfered with; that only national privileges were granted; but that, in respect of the use of the public domain and military and post roads, Congress had power to pass the act of 1866, and in dealing with the use of post roads by telegraph companies it dealt with public property.\n When the court held in the Pensacola Case that telegraphic communications between the states could be regulated by Congress under its power to regulate commerce, and that the statute of Florida which assumed to give to a Florida telegraph company an exclusive right in respect of telegraphic communications over certain territory in that state was inconsistent with the act of 1866, that was an end of that case, and nothing remained to be done except to dismiss the suit. The court itself so declared. Nothing more was in issue between the parties. The case involved, I confidently insist, no question as to the previous assent of the railroad company being a condition of the exercise by the Western Union Telegraph Company of the rights given by the act of 1866.\n Nor is the case of Western Union Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 244 S., 44 L. ed. 1052, 1054, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867, 869, an authority for the action of the circuit court. That was a case in which the only relief sought was the specific performance of a contract under which a telegraph company claimed the right to remain in the occupancy \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 590]\n\u00a0\n of the right of way of a railroad company. The court pertinently observed in that case that it was not claimed that 'the telegraph company had any right under the statute, and independently of the contract, to maintain and operate this telegraph line over the railroad company's property.' It was, however, claimed that, as the telegraph company was in the discharge of public duties, the circuit court 'should have so framed its decree as to preserve the occupancy of the telegraph company, subject to making compensation to the railroad company, the value of the alleged easement to be ascertained by the court.' But that view was rejected because the bill 'was not framed in that aspect' and so as to protect the occupancy of the telegraph company subject to the condition of its making compensation; and the court also said that the relief asked could not be given under the prayer for general relief, because not 'agreeable to the case made by the bill.'\n Now, the present bill has been framed so that the court can protect the right given to the telegraph company by the act of 1866 to have its wires and poles on the company's right of way, upon its being ascertained that such use will not interfere with the ordinary travel on the railroad, just compensation being made for that use, and the amount of compensation to be ascertained by the court in some appropriate way.\n In my judgment, nothing involved or in judgment in the Pensacola and Ann Arbor Cases requires the affirmance of the decree of the circuit court.\n The affirmance of that decree of the circuit court will mean that the efforts of Congress, by the act of 1866, to obtain for the people of the country the advantages accruing from competition between corporations of the different states in the matter of telegraphic communications, and also to promote and secure the interests of the government as involved in the conduct of its postal and military business, will prove of but little value. Indeed, as construed, it might have been better for the country if the act of 1866 had not been passed, and the states left free to establish such regulations in refer- \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 591]\n\u00a0\n ence to telegraphic communications, within in and over its territory, as would be appropriate and valid in the absence of congressional legislation on the subject. As the matter now stands, the whole subject is practically committed to the railroad companies. The court says that the act of 1866 is an efficient enactment for the purpose of preventing state interference with interstate telegraphic communications. As now construed, it would seem to be most efficient in tying the hands of the state, and leaving railroad companies operating post roads, so far as existing legislation is concerned, absolute masters of interstate communication by telegraph.\n In the Pensacola Case it was decided, and I think rightly, that in respect at least of interstate telegraphic communications, a state could not give exclusive privileges to a particular telegraph company. But, as just stated, by the necessary operation of the judgment now rendered a railroad company operating a post road can, in effect or practically, confer exclusive privileges upon a particular telegraph company, in respect of its right of way, by simply withholding its consent for a second telegraph company to occupy any part of such right of way with its wires and poles. If the government should be of opinion that the public business imperatively required another telegraph line upon the post road now occupied by the Pennsylvania Railroad, that company need only object to other telegraph lines being placed upon its right of way, and that will be the end of the matter, so far as the act of 1866, as now construed, is concerned. If the government and a telegraph company fully equipped should jointly represent to the railroad company that an additional company can be admitted to its right of way without obstructing the ordinary travel on that road, the company need only reply that no other telegraph company than the one now there can occupy its right of way, and that will be the end of the matter, so far as the act of 1866, as now construed, is concerned. And all this is now made possible, notwithstanding the decision of this court in United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 592]\n\u00a0\n above cited. In that case we propounded this question: 'Can it be said that after the passage of the act of 1866, and while it was in force, a railway company operating a post road of the United States could, by any form of agreement, exclude from its roadway a telegraph company which had accepted the provisions of that act?' We said that this question could be answered only in one way, 'namely, that every railroad company operating a post road of the United States, over which commerce among the states is carried on, was inhibited, after the act of July 24th, 1866, took effect, from making any agreement inconsistent with its provisions or that tended to defeat its operation.' The court added that it was very far from the intention of Congress by any legislation to so exert its power as to enable one telegraph corporation, Federal or state, to acquire exclusive rights over any post road. But now a railroad corporation operating a post road, and wishing its right of way occupied only by a single company with which it may have a special business arrangement for its own purposes, need not make even a secret agreement granting exclusive privileges to that company. It need only keep silence and withhold its assent to the occupancy of its right of way by another company, and in that way give exclusive privileges to the company with which it has a special arrangement; it may be to one organized wholly in the interest of the railroad company. In the Pensacola Case it was said that one of the objects of the act of 1866 was to prevent state monopolies in telegraphic communication, and that the privilege granted by that act was a national privilege. Now, although state monopolies cannot exist, railroad monopolies in telegraphic communications may exist; and the national privilege granted by the act of 1866 is left at the mercy of railroad companies operating the post roads of the United States.\n Practically, the railroad corporations operating post roads-looking to their own interests and perhaps caring little for the general welfare- are recognized as now having more power \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 593]\n\u00a0\n than a state. I cannot assent to any interpretation of the act of 1866 from which such a result can follow. No such result is, in my opinion, consistent either with the words of the act or with the objects which Congress, as this court has said, intended to accomplish by its passage. The act, reasonably interpreted, was, I think, intended to give a telegraph company accepting its provisions the absolute right to put its wires and poles upon any post road,-a public highway established primarily for the public convenience,-if the ordinary travel on such road was not thereby interfered with.\n For these reasons, I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n\n Brewer, J., concurring:\n I concur in the judgments in these cases, but do so distinctly on the ground that the questions have been settled in prior cases. If the matter was res integra, the views expressed by Mr. Justice Harlan would be very persuasive. Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 U.S. 1\n, 24 L. ed. 708, and Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867, seem to me controlling. In the first of these cases the scope of the power and authority granted by the act of 1866 was distinctly presented. It was within the proper limits of inquiry, and the opinion of the court shows that it was fully considered. The declarations in that opinion are clear and precise, and cannot be considered in any just sense obiter dicta. The decision was announced in 1877, and was reaffirmed in 1890 in the Ann Arbor case. If the court erred in its construction of the act, Congress has had twenty-seven years in which to correct the mistake. Its omission to take any action must be considered as an acquiescence on its part in that construction. And I am of the opinion that when this court has construed a statute of Congress, and that construction has remained for more than a \n\n[195 U.S. 540, 594]\n\u00a0\n quarter of a century, neither ther changed by any judicial decisions nor set aside by any congressional legislation, it ought not to be disturbed except for the most cogent reasons. \n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWETMORE v. MARKOE(1904)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1904\n\n\n\n On June 12, 1890, an action for divorce and alimony was begun by Annette B. W. Wetmore, wife of the plaintiff in error, in the supreme court of the state of New York, and on April 1, 1892, at special term, the plaintiff in error was found guilty of adultery as charged in the complaint, and a divorce was granted upon that ground to the defendant in error. The divorce was absolute, and awarded to the wife the custody and care of the three minor children of the marriage, and also, as alimony, the sum of $3,000 per annum so long as she should live, to be paid in quarterly instalments of $750 each on the first day of the months of July, October, January, and April of each year. There was also granted to the wife the sum of $3,000 annually, being $1,000 for the education and maintenance of each of the three minor children, to be paid in quarterly instalments, until such children should arrive at the age of twenty-one years respectively. Plaintiff in error was also re- \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 69]\n\u00a0\n quired to give security for the payment of the alimony awarded. The decree did not reserve any right of subsequent modification or amendment. On January 13, 1899, there was due to the wife from the plaintiff in error, for arrears in alimony and allowance under the decree, the sum of $19,221. 60. Upon that day, upon application to the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, the plaintiff in error was adjudicated a bankrupt. The defendant in error made no proof of her claim for alimony in the bankrupt proceedings. On June 21, 1900, the plaintiff in error was granted a discharge from all debts and claims provable under the bankruptcy act. On December 12, 1901, plaintiff in error sued out a writ in the supreme court of the state of New York for an order enjoining and restraining all proceedings on behalf of the defendant in error for the collection of the arrears of alimony and allowance aforesaid. This application was denied, upon the ground, as it appears from the memorandum of the judge who rendered the decision, that the arrears of alimony were not discharged in bankruptcy. From the order denying the application an appeal was taken by the plaintiff in error to the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of New York, where the order below was affirmed. The plaintiff in error thereupon appealed to the court of appeals of the state of New York, and on June 27, 1902, the appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, without any judgment of affirmance or reversal upon the merits. A writ of error was sued out seeking in this court a reversal of the judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York.\n Mr. William A. Keener and Messrs. Hatch, Keener, and Clute for plaintiff in error.   \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 70]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Flamen B. Candler, William Jay, and Robert W.

Shufeldt, \n181 U.S. 577\n, 45 L. ed. 1010, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, if the judgment for alimony had been rendered in a court having control over the decree with power to amend or alter the same. It is insisted, however, that, there being in this case no reservation of the right to change or modify the decree, it has become an absolute judgment, beyond the power of the court to alter or amend, and is therefore discharged by the bankruptcy proceedings. \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 72]\n\u00a0\n Walker v. Walker, 155 N. Y. 77, 49 N. E. 663; Livingston v. Livingston, 173 N. Y. 377, 61 L. R. A. 800, 93 Am. St. Rep. 600, 66 N. E. 123. It may be admitted to be the effect of these decisions of the New York court of appeals that, in the absence of any reservation of the right to modify or amend, the judgment for alimony becomes absolute. The question presented for decision, in view of this state of the law, is, Has the decree become a fixed liability evidenced by a judgment, and therefore provable against the estate of the bankrupt, within the protection of the discharge in bankruptcy? Section 63 of the act of 1898 provides:\n'Sec. 63. Debts which may be proved:--\n\n'Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that date, or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest.' [ 30 Stat. at L. 562, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3447.]\n\n It is not contended that this section includes instalments of alimony becoming due after the adjudication, but the contention is that prior instalments have become an existing liability, evidenced by the judgment, and therefore a provable debt. While this section enumerates under separate paragraphs the kind and character of claims to be proved and allowed in bankruptcy, the classification is only a means of describing 'debts' of the bankrupt which may be proved and allowed against his estate.\n The precise question, therefore, is, Is such a judgment as the one here under consideration a debt within the meaning of the act? The mere fact that a judgment has been rendered does not prevent the court from looking into the proceedings with a view of determining the nature of the liability which has been reduced to judgment. Boynton v. Ball, \n121 \nU.S. 457, 466\n, 30 S. L. ed. 985, 987, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 981. The question presented is not altogether new in this court. In the case of Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 U.S. 577\n, 45 L. ed. 1010, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 736, Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 73]\n\u00a0\n 'Alimony does not arise from any business transaction, but from the relation of marriage. It is not founded on contract, express or implied, but on the natural and legal duty of the husband to support the wife. The general obligation to support is made specific by the decree of the court of appropriate jurisdicrion. Generally speaking, alimony may be altered by that court at any time, as the circumstances of the parties may require. The decree of a court of one state, indeed, for the present payment of a definite sum of money as alimony, is a record which is entitled to full faith and credit in another state, and may, therefore, be there enforced by suit. Barber v. Barber (1858) 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226; Lynde v. Lynde (1901) \n181 U.S. 183\n, 45 L. ed. 810, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 555. But its obligation in that respect does not affect its nature. In other respects, alimony cannot ordinarily be enforced by action at law, but only by application to the court which granted it, and subject to the discretion of that court. Permanent alimony is regarded rather as a portion of the husband's estate to which the wife is equitably entitled than as strictly a debt; alimony from time to time may be regarded as a protion of his current income or earnings; and the considerations which affect either can be better weighed by the court having jurisdiction over the relation of husband and wife than by a court of a different jurisdiction.'\n In the same opinion Mr. Justice Gray quoted from Barclay v. Barclay, 184 III. 375, 51 L. R. A. 351, 56 N. E. 636, in which case it was adjudged that alimony could not be regarded as a debt owing from husband to wife, which might be discharged by an order in bankruptcy, whether the alimony accrued before or after the proceedings in bankruptcy:\n'The liability to pay alimony is not founded upon a contract, but is a penalty imposed for a failure to perform a duty. It is not to be enforced by an action at law in the state where the decree is entered, but is to be enforced by such proceedings as the chancellor may determine and adopt for its enforcement. It may be enforced by imprisonment for contempt, without violating the constitutional provision pro- \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 74]\n\u00a0\n hibiting imprisonment for debt. The decree for alimony may be changed from time to time by the chancellor, and there may be such circumstances as would authorize the chancellor to even change the amount to be paid by the husband, where he is in arrears in payments required under the decree. Hence, such alimony cannot be regarded as a debt owing from husband to the wife, and, not being so, cannot be discharged by an order in the bankruptcy court.'\n\n It is true that, in the cases referred to, the decrees were rendered in courts having continuing control over them, with power to alter or amend them upon application; but this fact does not change the essential character of the liability, nor determine whether a claim for alimony is, in its nature, contractual so as to make it a debt. The court having power to look behind the judgment, to determine the nature and extent of the liability, the obligation enforced is still of the same character notwithstanding the judgment. We think the reasoning of the Audubon Case recognizes the doctrine that a decree awarding alimony to the wife or children, or both, is not a debt which has been put in the form of a judgment, but is rather a legal means of enforcing the obligation of the husband and father to support and maintain his wife and children. He owes this duty, not because of any contractual obligation, or as a debt due from him to the wife, but because of the policy of the law which imposes the obligation upon the husband. The law interferes when the husband neglects or refuses to discharge this duty, and enforces it against him by means of legal proceedings.\n It is true that in the state of New York at the time this decree was rendered there was no power to modify or alter the decree for alimony and allowance in the absence of special reservation. But this does not change the grounds upon which the courts of the state proceeded in awarding the alimony and allowances. In the case of Romaine v. Chauncey, 129 N. Y. 566, 14 L. R. A. 712, 26 Am. St. Rep. 544, 29 N. E. 826, it was held that alimony was awarded, not in the payment of a debt, but in the performance of the general duty of the \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 75]\n\u00a0\n husband to support the wife. This case was quoted with approval by Mr. Justice Gray in Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 U.S. 575\n, 45 L. ed. 1009, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735.\n In Walker v. Walker, 155 N. Y. 77, 49 N. E. 663, and Livingston v. Livingston, 173 N. Y. 377, 61 L. R. A. 800, 93 Am. St. Rep. 600, 66 N. E. 123, the effect of the holdings is that a judgment for alimony, in the absence of reservation, is a fixed and unalterable determination of the amount to be contributed to the wife's support after the decree, and is beyond the power of the court to change even under the authority of subsequent legislation. These cases do not modify the grounds upon which alimony is awarded, and recognize that an alimony decree is a provision for the support of the wife, settled and determined by the judgment of the court.\n In the case of Dunbar v. Dunbar, decided by this court at the October term, 1902 (\n190 U.S. 340\n, 47 L. ed. 1084, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757), it was held that a contract made after divorce between husband and wife, by which the former agreed to pay the latter a certain sum of money annually for her support during her life, or so long as she remained unmarried, and also to pay a certain sum of money to her annually for the support of the minor children of the marriage, whose custody was awarded to the mother, was not discharged by a subsequent proceeding and discharge in bankruptcy. It was further held that the sum agreed to be paid for the support of the minor children was but a recognition of the liability of the father for their support, and that the fact that the annual instalments were made payable to the wife made no difference in the character of the obligation. Of this feature of the contract the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Peckham, said:\n ,'In relation to that part of the husband's contract to pay for the support of his monor children until they respectively become of age, we also think that it was not of a nature to be proved in bankruptcy. At common law, a father is bound to support his legitimate children, and the obligation continues during their minority. We may assume this obligation to exist in all the states. In this case the decree of the court provided that the children should remain in the custody of \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 76]\n\u00a0\n the wife, and the contract to contribute a certain sum yearly for the support of each child during his minority was simply a contract to do that which the law obliged him to do; that is, to support his minor children . . . . We think it was not the intention of Congress, in passing a bankruptcy act, to provide for the release of the father from his obligation to support his children by his discharge in bankruptcy, and if not, then we see no reason why his contract to do that which the law obliged him to do should be discharged in that way. As his discharge would not in any event terminate his obligation to support his children during their minority, we see no reason why his written contract acknowledging such obligation and agreeing to pay a certain sum (which may be presumed to have been a reasonable one) in fulfilment thereof should be so discharged. It is true his promise is to pay to the mother; but on this branch of the contract it is for the purpose of supporting his two minor children, and he simply makes her his agent for that purpose.'\n We think this language is equally applicable to the present case in that aspect of the decree which provides for the support of the minor children. The obligation continues after the discharge in bankruptcy as well as before, and is no more than the duty devolved by the law upon the husband to support his children, and is not a debt in any just sense.\n It is urged that the amendment of the law made by the act of February 5, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487], excepting from the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy a decree for alimony due or to become due, or for the maintenance and support of the wife and minor children, is a legislative recognition of the fact that, prior to the passage of the amendment, judgments for alimony would be discharged. InDunbar v. Dunbar, \n190 U.S. 340\n, 47 L. ed. 1084, 23 sup. Ct. Rep. 757, it was said that this amendment, while it did not apply to prior cases, may be referred to for the purpose of showing the legislative trend in the direction of not discharging an obligation of the bankrupt for the support and maintenance of wife and children. The amendment may also have been passed \n\n[196 U.S. 68, 77]\n\u00a0\n with a view to settling the law upon this subject, and to put at rest the controversies which had arisen from the conflicting decisions of the courts, both state and Federal, upon this question. Indeed, in view of the construction of the act in this court in Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 U.S. 575\n, 45 L. ed. 1009, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, it may be said to be merely declaratory of the true meaning and sense of the statute. United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 11 L. ed. 724; Bailey v. Clark, 21 Wall. 284, 288, 22 L. ed. 651, 653; Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 34 S. L. ed. 832, 834, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222. The bankruptcy law should receive such an interpretation as will effectuate its beneficent purposes, and not make it an instrument to deprive dependent wife and children of the support and maintenance due them from the husband and father, which it has ever been the purpose of the law to enforce. Systems of bankruptcy are designed to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of indebtedness which has become oppressive, and to permit him to have a fresh start in business or commercial life, freed from the obligation and responsibilities which may have resulted from business misfortunes. Unless positively required by direct enactment the courts should not presume a design upon the part of Congress, in relieving the unfortunate debtor, to make the law a means of avoiding enforcement of the obligation, moral and legal, devolved upon the husband to support his wife and to maintain and educate his children. While it is true in this case the obligation has become fixed by an unalterable decree so far as the amount to be contributed by the husband for the support is concerned, looking beneath the judgment for the foundation upon which it rests, we find it was not decreed for any debt of the bankrupt, but was only a means designed by the law for carrying into effect, and making available to the wife and children, the right which the law gives them as against the husband and father.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and the same is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWINOUS POINT SHOOTING CLUB v. CASPERSEN(1904)\nNo. 153\nArgued: February 24, 1904Decided: March 7, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. S. H. Holding, Harvey D. Goulder, and Frank S. Masten for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. George A. True for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit brought by the Winous Point Shooting Club against Caspersen and others in the court of common pleas, Ottawa county, Ohio, to enjoin defendants from fishing on certain premises alleged to be parts of Sandusky river and Mud creek, and to belong to plaintiff.\n The court found that the waters in dispute formed part of a public bay, which defendants had the right to navigate and to fish in; and dismissed the petition.\n The case was then carried to the circuit court of Ottawa \n\n[193 U.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n county and there tried de novo. That court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law; held that the waters in question were not parts of Sandusky river and Mud creek, and formed part of a public bay, in whose waters defendants, as members of the public, had the right of navigation and fishing; and the petition was again dismissed. Plaintiff then took the case on error to the supreme court of Ohio, and, with other alleged errors not material here, assigned as error that 'the judgment of the court is in contravention of  19, article 1, of the Constitution of Ohio, and article 5 of the Constitution of the United States, in that by said judgment the private property of the plaintiff in error is taken for public use without just compensation.' There was no suggestion that any right under the Constitution, or any statute of, or authority exercised under, the United States, had been specially set up or claimed, and decided against. The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court and entered an order certifying as 'part of the record in this case and of the judgment and entry of affirmance heretofore rendered and made herein, that in the prosecution of error to this court from the circuit court of Ottawa county, and in the arguments made in this court, in behalf of plaintiff in error, it was insisted and relied upon by said plaintiff that the waters in dispute had been surveyed and meandered by the United States as those of Sandusky river and Muddy creek, and the lands mentioned and described in said case had been surveyed, sold, and patented by the United States to plaintiff's predecessors in title as lands bordering upon said river and creek, all of which acts had been done under authority of acts of Congress; that plaintiff had and possessed the sole and exclusive right of fishing in said waters; that the judgment and decree of the said circuit court, that said waters are not those of Sandusky river and Muddy creek, but those of an open and public bay, in which the public had the rights of fishing, was in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, in that plaintiff was deprived of its private property, and the same was taken for a public use, without just \n\n[193 U.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n compensation to it; and it became material to the determination of said case in this court to determine said question so made by plaintiff in error, which was determined adversely to plaintiff in error, as appears in the entry and judgment of affirmance heretofore made herein.'\n The certificate in itself would not confer jurisdiction, but may properly be referred to, and it appears therefrom, as well as from the terms of the assignment of error in the supreme court, that plaintiff's contention was that the judgment of the circuit court was in violation of the 5th Amendment. But that amendment is a restriction on Federal power, and not on the power of the states. The supreme court of Ohio gave no affirmative expression of its views in that regard, or, indeed, in respect of  19 of article 1 of the Constitution of Ohio, treating of taking private property for public use on compensation made.\n The judgment was affirmed on the authority of Bodi v. Winous Point Shooting Club, 57 Ohio St. 226, 48 N. E. 944. In that case the same waters were in dispute as in this case, and it was held that they formed 'part of a public bay, and not parts of the Sandusky river and Mud creek,' and the ruling in Sloan v. Biemiller, 34 Ohio St. 492, sustaining the public rights of navigation and fishing, in such circumstances, was followed and approved.\n Federal questions cannot be raised here which did not arise below, and as the 5th Amendment had no application, the averment of its violation created no real Federal question.

CO.(1904)\nNo. 20\nArgued: October 25, 1904Decided: November 14, 1904\n\n\n\n Messrs. Boykin Wright and John C. Hart for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joseph B. Cumming, Alexander C. King, Bryan Cumming, and King Spalding, & Little for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here on certiorari to the circuit court of appeals, that court haing affirmed, per curiam, a decree of the circuit court enjoining the comtroller general of Georgia from collecting a tax for the year 1900. 116 Fed. 669, 54 C. C. A. 672, 117 Fed. 1007. In view of the conclusion to which we have been driven, it is enough to say that the question presented is whether shares of stock in the Western Railway of Alabama, an Alabama corporation, held by the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company, a Georgia corporation, are taxable as property of the latter, by the state of Georgia, under its Constitution and statutes. The defendants in error, the plaintiffs below, are lessees of the Georgia corporation, and are bound to reimburse the latter for the tax, if it has to be paid. Taking into account the decision in kidd v. Alabama, \n188 U.S. 730\n, 47 L. ed. 669, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401 \n\n[195 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n the power of the state to tax the shares is not denied, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, but it is argued that the state has not attempted to use that power by its present Constitution and laws.\n The Constitution of Georgia provides that 'all taxation shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.' Code of 1895,  5883. The words 'within the territorial limits' plainly qualify 'subject to be taxed.' The Constitution further makes void all laws exempting property from taxation, other than the property therein enumerated, which does not include this stock.  5886. Following these requirements the general tax act for 1899 and 1900, Laws of 1898, No. 150 ,  1, 2, p. 22, authorizes a tax on all of the taxable property of the state.\n The natural inference from the foregoing language is that the comptroller general was bound to collect this tax. It is true that it was said, in a case decided before the date of the present Constitution, that stock in railroads outside the state was not taxable in Georgia, the reason offered being that such stock is really but so many shares of the railroad's property, and that that property is real estate, for the most part at least, and taxable by the state in which the road lies. Wright v. Southwestern R. Co. 64 Ga. 783, 799. This reason is shown by later decisions to be an insufficient ground for a claim of constitutional right, and the language of the case probably does not represent adequately the present opinion of the supreme court, although the passage is cited in the later of the two following cases: Georgia State Bldg. & L. Asso. v. Savannah, 109 Ga. 63, 69, 35 S. E. 67; People's Nat. Bank v. Cleveland, 117 Ga. 908, 913, 915, 44 S. E. 20.\n If we look to the construction adopted by the legislature, there is no doubt as to that. The Code, after defining personalty as property movable in its nature, continues: 'Stocks representing shares in an incorporated company holding lands, \n\n[195 U.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n or a franchise in or over lands, are personalty.'  3070. The act of 1884- 1885, touching returns of property for taxation, No. 457,  2, p. 30, enacted in terms 'that personal property shall be construed, for purposes of taxation, to include . . . all stocks and securities, whether in corporations within this state or in other states, owned by citizens of this state, unless exempt,' etc. It is argued on one side and denied on the other that this section was repealed by the Code; but whether it was or not, it equally may be invoked for the purpose of interpretation, at least. We do not understand and cannot believe that the supreme court of the state would deny the power of the legislature under the present Constitution to tax stock.\n The argument against the tax is that the Constitution of Georgia is satisfied if all the lands and goods in the state are taxed once, and that the appearance of the same capital in two forms, technically distinct, ought not to be laid hold of as an excuse for two taxes. It is admitted that no such double taxation is enforced with regard to corporations of which the property is taxed within the state, and it hardly would be contended that this wise moderation is unconstitutional. It even has been thought that a similar constitution forbade taxation of both capital and stock. People ex rel. Burke v. Badlam, 57 Cal. 594, 601. But, from the point of view of the taxpayer, it does not matter whether all of his double taxation is done in one state or half in one and half in another. He suffers the same injustice. And, as manifestly the clearest right to tax belongs to the state where the railroad has its tracks, every principle of justice and patriotism would require the same abstinence from taxing stocks of the railroads of neighboring states that is practised with regard to those of the taxing state-in this case Georgia-itself.\n The difficulty with this argument is that the Georgia Constitution requires the taxation of all property subject to be taxed in Georgia. And while it may be that the constitutional requirement is sufficiently complied with when the land and \n\n[195 U.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n chattels which give value to the stock pay a tax, without another tax on the stock, there is much more difficulty in saying that the words are satisfied if stock is left untaxed when the land and chattels cannot be reached. Probably the Constitution does not go further than to require one tax on all attainable sources of value, even if it permits more. People ex rel. Burke v. Badlam, 57 Cal. 594, 601. But it certainly seems intended to tax once, at least, all property which can be come at in any way. San Francisco v. Fry, 63 Cal. 470. A tax in another state is no tax for the purposes of the state of Georgia. Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 47 S. L. ed. 669, 672, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401; Dwight v. Boston, 12 Allen, 316; Seward v. Rising Sun, 79 Ind. 351; Dyer v. Osborne, 11 R. I. 321, 23 Am. Rep. 460; McKeen v. Northampton, 49 Pa. 519, 88 Am. Dec. 515.\n Putting the case at the lowest, the above cited section of the Constitution was adopted in the interest of the state as a tax-collector, and authorizes, if it does not require, a tax on the stock. In pursuance of the Constitution, the law of 1898, under which this tax is demanded, contains the following: 'In addition to the questions now propounded to taxpayers by the tax-receivers, questions shall be framed by the comptroller general to reach all property upon which a tax is imposed by this act, and especially the following questions: . . . Thirtieth-How many shares of stock did you own on the day fixed for the return of property for taxation issued by corporations located without this state? Thirty- first-What was the gross nominal value thereof? Thirty-second-What was the fair market value thereof?' Laws of 1898, No. 150,  16, p. 36. This plainly contemplates that the mandate of the Constitution shall be carried out, and in view of  1, 2, of the same act, referred to above, and of the facts that legislation could not make the requirement to tax more explicit, and that the Constitution seems to be regarded by the supreme court of the state as self-executing (Georgia State Bldg. & L. Asso. v. Savannah, 109 Ga. 63, 35 S. E. 67), we think it impossible to escape from the words. The distinction in- \n\n[195 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n tended between stock in corporations of which the property is taxed by the state and that in corporations otherwise untaxed is emphasized by the thirty-third question: 'How many shares of stocks did you own, . . . issued by corporations within this state, the capital stock of which or the property of which is not returned by such corporation for taxation?' We think the distinction consistent with the Constitution, if not required by it, as held in People ex rel. Burke v. Badlam, 57 Cal. 594, 601.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWRIGHT v. MINNESOTA MUT. LIFE INS. CO.(1904)\nNo. 178\nArgued: March 15, 1904Decided: April 4, 1904\n\n\n\n\n This case originated in a bill filed in the circuit court seeking to declare a dissolution of the insurance company, the sequestration of its assets, and have a receiver appointed with a view to winding up the affairs of the association. On the 6th of August, 1880, an insurance association was organized under the laws of Minnesota, known as the Bankers' Association; afterwards, in 1884, its name was changed to the Bankers' Life Association of Minnesota. The general purposes of the association were to secure benevolent and fraternal co-operation between its members, and pecuniary assistance to the families of its deceased members and other designated beneficiaries. Its \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 658]\n\u00a0\n general plan of operation was declared to be to assess and collect from its members and to pay over to the beneficiaries certain stipulated sums, to be secured to them by sufficient pledges of money, which should be kept invested in United States registered bonds. Male persons, not less than eighteen years nor over fifty-five years of age, approved by the medical director, were eligible to membership upon a deposit of as many dollars as such person was years of age, as a part of the 'guaranty trust fund,' which fund was to be a pledge to secure payment to be made by the association upon the death of members, and was to belong to the association; also a membership fee equal to half the guaranty deposit, and the proportion of the annual expense assessment for the year was required. It was provided:\n'Each member of this corporation shall pay thereto, on the last secular day of September, in each year, an assessment equal to 15 per cent on his contribution to the 'guaranty trust fund,' to meet the operating expenses, and to be known as his 'annual dues;' and upon the death of any member each surviving member shall also pay to said corporation, on demand, an assessment equal to 2 per cent on his contribution to said 'guaranty trust fund,' and out of this sum, obtained from said last-named assessment, which shall be known as the 'mortuary assessment,' there shall be paid to such beneficiary as is designated in the membership certificate the sum of money in the said certificate named.\n\n'All assessments upon members of this corporation shall be apportioned among all members thereof pro rata,-that is to say, in proportion to the amount that each member has paid into said guaranty trust fund. All assessments due or to be paid to this corporation shall be paid to such officers or persons and at such places as the said board of trustees shall name and specify. In order to secure prompt payment of all losses occasioned by death of its members, and to avoid unreasonable expense incident to the making and collection of assessments, and to promote the convenience of all parties, said assessments \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n need not be made on account of such death loss separately, but may be made at stated intervals as said board of trustees may direct, to provide for all or any death losses of said corporation that have taken place prior to the making of any such assessment or assessments. Any assessment for the purpose of paying any death losses shall uniformly be 2 per cent of each surviving member's contribution to said 'guaranty trust fund' for each such death loss, and in case any such assessment shall produce a gross amount in excess of the amount needed to pay such death losses, then such excess may be used to discharge death losses subsequently occurring.'\n\n Article 10 provides as follows:\n'All amounts pledged to this company to secure payment of assessments occasioned by death of the members shall be used only for that purpose and meanwhile the same shall be and remain invested in United States registered bonds, and shall constitute and be known as 'the guaranty trust fund.' Such bonds shall be made payable to this company, and shall be transferable or convertible only upon resolution of its board of trustees, and such board shall have the exclusive charge and control thereof.\n\n'All interest realized from such bonds shall meanwhile be used to defray the company's operating expenses.\n\n'This article shall never be amended, or in any way at all changed, without the consent of every member of this company, to be given in writing signed by him, and filed with the company's secretary, and reciting in full the proposed amendment or change.'\n\n It was provided that amounts payable to beneficiaries should be collected by the company from its members, and in case of death or default on the part of any member in payment of his assessments, the association might use his deposit in the guarantee fund to pay death losses in such manner as it might deem best, such use not to work a payment of any assessment as against the defaulting member.\n Upon the death of a member the beneficiary was to receive \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n a sum equal to 2 per cent of the then subsisting guaranty trust fund, not exceeding, however, $2,000 upon each full membership, and not exceeding in any case $6,000. Power to amend the articles was vested in the trustees ( except as therein otherwise provided), and they were to direct, manage, and control the business of the company.\n Wright became a member of the company on December 10, 1892, and Truby on March 13, 1893. On December 24, 1898, the board of trustees adopted amended articles of association and by-laws. The amended articles declared that the by-laws shall contain provisions which shall operate to preserve, continue, guard, and protect all of the existing rights and privileges of, and promises and pledges to, persons who were members at the time the amended articles became operative.\n Under the new articles a form of policy was issued, known as the 'guaranteed option policy.' These policies were issued to new holders, and members under the assessment plan were permitted to transfer their membership so as to receive such policies, which required the payment by the insured of a stipulated annual premium in advance. The premiums were figured upon certain tables of mortality, and approximate those which would have been charged by an old line company on the legal reserve basis. This form of policy contained a condition providing that if the fund derived from such policies shall be reduced below the amount of the reserve, the company may require the insured to pay his just proportion of the deficiency within sixty days after written request therefor; or, at the option of the company, such proportion, with compound interest thereon at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, may be charged as a lien against the policy and any sum which may become payable thereunder. And in another form of policy it was stipulated that if unexpected losses and expenses shall be found to have reduced the funds derived from such policies below the amount of the reserve, the company shall have the right to apportion the deficiency ratably against it and each similar \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n policy in proportion to its reserve, and the amount so proportioned against each policy to be an indebtedness thereon, bearing interest at 4 per cent per annum thereon until paid by dividends or otherwise.\n Afterwards, at a regular meeting and as provided in the laws of Minnesota (General Laws of Minnesota of 1901, chapter 143), the company, on August 5, 1901, accepted the provisions of the statute making the company a regular reserve company, with a policy on which a stated premium is paid and a fixed sum is payable at death to the beneficiaries of the insured. The name of the company was changed to the Minnesota Life Insurance Company.\n Section 21 of the act provides, among other things, 'Any insurance company, not excepting companies transacting life or casualty business on the mortuary assessment or stipulated premium plan or either thereof, may qualify and be governed by this chapter, anything in its special charter to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided, that nothing herein contained shall impair, or operate to impair, the obligation of any contract; and provided further, that after such qualification the company qualifying shall be governed solely by the act; and provided further, that nothing in this act contained shall apply to any town insurance, mortuary assessment, or stipulated premium company, unless and until it shall accept and qualify under the provisions hereof; and provided further, that notice of the acceptance of said act be filed with the insurance commissioner.'\n Section 1 of the by-laws of the reorganized company provides:\n'Sec. 1. To the extent necessary to protect and continue the rights and privileges of any member holding a mortuary assessment certificate, and to preserve and secure the fulfilment of all contract obligations to him, and to continue and perpetuate in the company the power and authority to levy assessments and to do and perform all and cverything necessary or expedient to enable it to carry out the mortuary assessment con- \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n tracts in accordance with the terms thereof and with the law and present bylaws in such case made and provided, the present and existing by-laws shall continue in full force and effect.'\n\n A large amount of business has been done on the new plan, and the record discloses that the company has kept its contracts, is solvent, and doing business in many states.\n Mr. John F. Byers and Messrs. Dillon & Goetz for appellants.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Jared How, Carl Taylor, and Timothy R. Palmer for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill on the part of two dissatisfied holders of certificates, issued while the company was doing business on the assessment plan, to wind up the affairs and distribute the assets of what appears, so far as the record discloses, to be a solvent and prosperous mutual insurance company with which others in interest are apparently satisfied. The Federal right alleged to be invaded, and the one adjudicated upon, which gives a right of direct appeal from the decree dismissing the bill to this court, is the constitutional guaranty against the impairment of the obligation of a contract contained in  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. The complaining certificate holders allege that the laws of Minnesota, under which the changes in the plan of the insurance business done by the defendant company were made, from the assessment to the legal reserve, flat premium plan of 'old line' insurance, work a violation of that provision. As this is the groundwork of the bill in the Federal court, it becomes necessary to make a case duly invoking protection of rights secured by the Federal Constitution. The statute in question expressly \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n provides that it shall not operate to impair the obligation of any contract. In view of the argument that the act must necessarily have that effect, we inquire whether there was a contract with the certificate holders that the plan of insurance should never be changed. It is to be observed that the right of amendment of the articles of association, except in one particular, was reserved in the original articles of association. In article 10 it was provided that the amounts pledged to secure payment of assessments occasioned by the death of members should be used only for that purpose, and the same should remain invested in United States registered bonds. This article, it was expressly provided, should never be amended or in any way changed, without the written consent of every member of the company. It appears that in the changes through which this company has passed this article has not been amended, and the fund has remained intact for the uses and purposes stated. It is not every change in the charter or articles of associations of a corporation that will work such a departure from the purposes of its creation as to forfeit obligations incurred to it or prevent the carrying on of the modified business. A radical departure affecting substantial rights may release those who had come into the corporation on the basis of its original charter.\n There is much discussion in the authorities as to when a charter amendment is of that fundamental character that a majority of the members or stockholders cannot bind the minority by agreeing to a change in the nature of the business to be carried on or the purposes and objects for which the corporation was created. Each case depends upon its own circumstances, and how far the right of amendment has been impliedly or expressly reserved in the creation of corporate rights. It would be unreasonable and oppressive to require a member or stockholder to remain in a corporation whose fundamental purposes have been changed against his will. On the other hand, where the right of amendment is reserved in the statute or articles of association, it is because the right to make changes \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n which the business may require is recognized, and the exercise of the privilege may be vested in the controlling body of the corporation. In such cases, where there is an exercise of the power in good faith, which does not change the essential character of the business, but authorizes its extension upon a modified plan, both reason and authority support the corporation in the exercise of the right. Nugent v. Putnam County, 19 Wall. 241, 251, 22 L. ed. 83, 89; Picard v. Hughey, 58 Ohio St. 577, 51 N. E. 133; Miller v. American Mut. Acci. Ins. Co. 92 Tenn. 167-185, 20 L. R. A. 765, 21 S. W. 39; Supreme Lodge K. of P. v. Knight, 117 Ind. 489, 3 L. R. A. 409, 20 N. E. 479.\n In the present case we have, by express stipulation, the right to amend the articles, with the reservation noted as to article 10. Nor does it appear that the changes were arbitrarily made without good and substantial reason. The testimony in this record discloses that the experience of this assessment insurance company was not anomalous or unusual. It was a case of history repeating itself. Insurance payable from assessments upon members may begin with fine prospects, but the lapse of time, resulting in the maturing of certificates, and the abandonment of the plan for other insurance by the better class of risks, has not infrequently resulted in so increasing assessments and diminishing indemnity as to result in failure. The testimony that such was the history of this enterprise is ample. The changes of 1898 to a plan of issuing, in exchange for certificates and upon new business, a policy having some of the features of old line insurance, seems to have been fully justified by the state of the company's business. And the subsequent change to a policy with straight premiums and fixed indemnity was approved by the majority of the members upon proceedings had under the Minnesota statute, and has resulted in a successful business and a considerable change of the members to the new and more stable plan. It does not appear that any certificate has been unpaid, nor is any failure shown to levy assessments required under the original articles.\n It is doubtless true that the assessments have increased owing to the lesser number subject to assessment, and the death of \n\n[193 U.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n members. What would have been realized from assessments had there been no change of plan is matter of conjecture. The business is still that of mutual insurance, notwithstanding changed methods of operation. The new plan has been legally adopted and approved by the insurance commissioner of the state. The argument for appellants is that, having begun as an assessment company, the plan can never be changed without the consent of all interested. But we have seen that the right of amendment was given in the original articles of association. There was no contract that the plan of insurance should never be changed. On the contrary, it was recognized that amendments might be necessary. There was no vested right to a continuation of a plan of insurance which experience might demonstrate would result disastrously to the company and its members. We are cited to the statutes of many states authorizing similar changes and transfer of membership, but to no case holding legislative authorization of a change of this character to work the impairment by the state of the obligation of a contract.\n The courts are slow to interfere with the management of societies, such as this mutual insurance company. While the rights of members will be protected against arbitrary action, such organizations will ordinarily be left to their own methods of action and management. The changes under consideration were made in good faith and have been accepted by many of the old members as well as those who have taken policies since the changes in plan have been made. In our view of the case the law of Minnesota did not impair the obligation of any contract, nor were the changes in the method and plan of this company beyond its corporate powers. There is much testimony in the record as to the good faith of this proceeding and the motives of the complainants in bringing it, which we do not deem it necessary to consider, as the conclusions announced dispose of the case in favor of an affirmance of the judgment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWYNN-JOHNSON v.

Where a creditor has a claim for a balance due against an insolvent debtor afterwards adjudicated a bankrupt, upon an open account for goods sold and delivered four months before the adjudication in bankruptcy, and during said period makes a number of sales of merchandise on credit to the insolvent debtor, which becomes a part of the debtor's estate, and during the same period receives payments of sums on account, from time to time, which payments are received in good faith, without knowledge of the debtor's insolvency on the part of the creditor, the sales exceeding in amount during said period the payments made during the same time,-has the creditor, under such circumstances, received a preference which he is obliged to surrender before his claim shall be allowed under the bankrupt act?\n\n'2. If each of such payments is a preference under the act, is it to be set off under  60c1 of the act by deducting subsequent sales therefrom, carrying forward to the next payment any excess of preferences, but not of sales, treating any excess of preferences as thus ascertained as a sum to be surrendered before the allowance of the creditor's claim?'\n\n The first question is answered in the negative on the authority of Jaquith v.
