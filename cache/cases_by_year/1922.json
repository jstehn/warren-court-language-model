States Supreme Court\nADKINS v. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(1922)\nNo. 795\nArgued: March 14, 1923Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n In addition to the cases cited above, there are decisions of this court dealing with laws especially relating to hours of labor for women. Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 U.S. 671\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 469; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 U.S. 373\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 U.S. 385\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 345.\n In the Muller Case the validity of an Oregon statute, forbidding the employment of any female in certain industries more than 10 hours during any one day was upheld. The decision proceeded upon the theory that the difference between the sexes may justify a different rule respecting hours of labor in the case of women than in the case of men. It is pointed out that these consist in differences of physical structure, especially in respect \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 553]\n\u00a0\n of the maternal functions, and also in the fact that historically woman has always been dependent upon man, who has established his control by superior physical strength. The Cases of Riley, Miller, and Bosley follow in this respect the Muller Case. But the ancient inequality of the sexes, otherwise than physical, as suggested in the Muller Case (\n208 U.S. 421\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 327, 13 Ann. Cas. 957) has continued 'with diminishing intensity.' In view of the great-not to say revolutionary- changes which have taken place since that utterance, in the contractual, political, and civil status of women, culminating in the Nineteenth Amendment, it is not unreasonable to say that these differences have now come almost, if not quite, to the vanishing point. In this aspect of the matter, while the physical differences must be recognized in appropriate cases, and legislation fixing hours or conditions of work may properly take them into account, we cannot accept the doctrine that women of mature age, sui juris, require or may be subjected to restrictions upon their liberty of contract which could not lawfully be imposed in the case of men under similar circumstances. To do so would be to ignore all the implications to be drawn from the present day trend of legislation, as well as that of common thought and usage, by which woman is accorded emancipation from the old doctrine that she must be given special protection or be subjected to special restraint in her contractual and civil relationships. In passing, it may be noted that the instant statute applies in the case of a woman employer contracting with a woman employee as it does when the former is a man.\n The essential characteristics of the statute now under consideration, which differentiate it from the laws fixing hours of labor, will be made to appear as we proceed. It is sufficient now to point out that the latter, as well as the statutes mentioned under paragraph (3), deal with incidents of the employment having no necessary effect upon \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 554]\n\u00a0\n the heart of the contract; that is, the amount of wages to be paid and received. A law forbidding work to continue beyond a given number of hours leaves the parties free to contract about wages and thereby equalize whatever additional burdens may be imposed upon the employer as a result of the restrictions as to hours, by an adjustment in respect of the amount of wages. Enough has been said to show that the authority to fix hours of labor cannot be exercised except in respect of those occupations where work of long continued duration is detrimental to health. This court has been careful in every case where the question has been raised, to place its decision upon this limited authority of the Legislature to regulate hours of labor and to disclaim any purpose to uphold the legislation as fixing wages, thus recognizing an essential difference between the two. It seems plain that these decisions afford no real support for any form of law establishing minimum wages.\n If now, in the light furnished by the foregoing exceptions to the general rule forbidding legislative interference with freedom of contract, we examine and analyze the statute in question, we shall see that it differs from them in every material respect. It is not a law dealing with any business charged with a public interest or with public work, or to meet and tide over a temporary emergency. It has nothing to do with the character, methods or periods of wage payments. It does not prescribe hours of labor or conditions under which labor is to be done. It is not for the protection of persons under legal disability or for the prevention of fraud. It is simply and exclusively a price-fixing law, confined to adult women (for we are not now considering the provisions relating to minors), who are legally as capable of contracting for themselves as men. It forbids two parties having lawful capacity-under penalties as to the employer-to freely contract with one another in respect of the price for \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 555]\n\u00a0\n which one shall render service to the other in a purely private employment where both are willing, perhaps anxious, to agree, even though the consequence may be to oblige one to surrender a desirable engagement and the other to dispense with the services of a desirable employee. \n1\n The price fixed by the board need have no relation to he capacity or earning power of the employee, the number of hours which may happen to constitute the day's work, the character of the place where the work is to be done, or the circumstances or surroundings of the employment, and, while it has no other basis to support its validity than the assumed necessities of the employee, it takes no account of any independent resources she may have. It is based wholly on the opinions of the members of the board and their advisers-perhaps an average of their opinions, if they do not precisely agree-as to what will be necessary to provide a living for a woman, keep her in health and preserve her morals. It applies to any and every occupation in the District, without regard to its nature or the character of the work.\n The standard furnished by the statute for the guidance of the board is so vague as to be impossible of practical application with any reasonable degree of accuracy. What is sufficient to supply the necessary cost of living for a woman worker and maintain her in good health and protect her morals is obviously not a precise or unvarying sum-not even approximately so. The amount will depend upon a variety of circumstances: The individual temperament, habits of thrift, care, ability to buy necessaries intelligently, and whether the woman live alone or with her family. To those who practice economy, a given sum will afford comfort, while to those or contrary habit the same sum will be wholly inadequate. The co-operative economies of the family group are not taken into account, \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 556]\n\u00a0\n though they constitute an important consideration in estimating the cost of living, for it is obvious that the individual expense will be less in the case of a member of a family than in the case of one living alone. The relation between earnings and morals is not capable of standardization. It cannot be shown that well-paid women safeguard their morals more carefully than those who are poorly paid. Morality rests upon other considerations than wages, and there is, certainly, no such prevalent connection between the two as to justify a broad attempt to adjust the latter with reference to the former. As a means of safeguarding morals the attempted classification, in our opinion, is without reasonable basis. No distinction can be made between women who work for others and those who do not; nor is there ground for distinction between women and men, for, certainly, if women require a minimum wage to preserve their morals men require it to preserve their honesty. For these reasons, and others which might be stated, the inquiry in respect of the necessary cost of living and of the income necessary to preserve health and morals presents an individual and not a composite question, and must be answered for each individual considered by herself and not by a general formula prescribed by a statutory bureau.\n This uncertainty of the statutory standard is demonstrated by a consideration of certain orders of the board already made. These orders fix the sum to be paid to a woman employed in a place where food is served or in a mercantile establishment, at $16.50 per week; in a printing establishment, at $15.50 per week; and in a laundry, at $15 per week, with a provision reducing this to $9 in the case of a beginner. If a woman employed to serve food requires a minimum of $16.50 per week, it is hard to understand how the same woman working in a printing establishment or in a laundry is to get on with an income lessened by from $1 to $7.50 per week. The board probably \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 557]\n\u00a0\n found it impossible to follow the indefinite standard of the statute, and brought other and different factors into the problem; and this goes far in the direction of demonstrating the fatal uncertainty of the act, an infirmity which, in our opinion, plainly exists.\n The law takes account of the necessities of only one party to the contract. It ignores the necessitie of the employer by compelling him to pay not less than a certain sum, not only whether the employee is capable of earning it, but irrespective of the ability of his business to sustain the burden, generously leaving him, of course, the privilege of abandoning his business as an alternative for going on at a loss. Within the limits of the minimum sum, he is precluded, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, from adjusting compensation to the differing merits of his employees. It compels him to pay at least the sum fixed in any event, because the employee needs it, but requires no service of equivalent value from the employee. It therefore undertakes to solve but one-half of the problem. The other half is the establishment of a corresponding standard of efficiency, and this forms no part of the policy of the legislation, although in practice the former half without the latter must lead to ultimate failure, in accordance with the inexorable law that no one can continue indefinitely to take out more than he puts in without ultimately exhausting the supply. The law is not confined to the great and powerful employers but embraces those whose bargaining power may be as weak as that of the employee. It takes no account of periods of stress and business depression, of crippling losses, which may leave the employer himself without adequate means of livelihood. To the extent that the sum fixed exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of a partially indigent person, for whose condition there \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 558]\n\u00a0\n rests upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect, arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.\n The feature of this statute, which perhaps more than any other, puts upon it the stamp of invalidity, is that it exacts from the employer an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with his business, or the contract or the work the employee engages to do. The declared basis, as already pointed out, is not the value of the service rendered, but the extraneous circumstance that the employee needs to get a prescribed sum of money to insure her subsistence, health, and morals. The ethical right of every worker, man or woman, to a living wage may be conceded. One of the declared and important purposes of trade organizations is to secure it. And with that principle and with every legitimate effort to realize it in fact, no one can quarrel; but the fallacy of the proposed method of attaining it is that it assumes that every employer is bound at all events to furnish it. The moral requirement implicit in every contract of employment, viz. that the amount to be paid and the service to be rendered shall bear to each other some relation of just equivalence, is completely ignored. The necessities of the employee are alone considered, and these arise outside of the employment, are the same when there is no employment, and as great in one occupation as in another. Certainly the employer, by paying a fair equivalent for the service rendered, though not sufficient to support the employee, has neither caused nor contributed to her poverty. On the contrary, to the extent of what he pays, he has relieved it. In principle, there can be no difference between the case of selling labor and the case of selling goods. If one goes to the butcher, the baker, or grocer to buy food, he is morally entitled to obtain the worth of his money; but he is not entitled to more. If what he gets is worth what he pays, he is not justified in demanding \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 559]\n\u00a0\n more, simply because he needs more; and the shopkeeper, having dealt fairly and honestly in that transaction, is not concerned in any peculiar sense with the question of his customer's necessities. Should a statute undertake to vest in a commission power to determine the quantity of food necessary for individual support, and require the shopkeeper, if he sell to the individual at all, to furnish tha quantify at not more than a fixed maximum, it would undoubtedly fall before the constitutional test. The fallacy of any argument in support of the validity of such a statute would be quickly exposed. The argument in support of that now being considered is equally fallacious, though the weakness of it may not be so plain. A statute requiring an employer to pay in money, to pay at prescribed and regular intervals, to pay the value of the services rendered, even to pay with fair relation to the extent of the benefit obtained from the service, would be understandable. But a statute which prescribes payment without regard to any of these things, and solely with relation to circumstances apart from the contract of employment, the business affected by it, and the work done under it, is so clearly the product of a naked, arbitrary exercise of power that it cannot be allowed to stand under the Constitution of the United States.\n We are asked, upon the one land, to consider the fact that several states have adopted similar statutes, and we are invited, upon the other hand, to give weight to the fact that three times as many states, presumably as well informed and as anxious to promote the health and morals of their people, have refrained from enacting such legislation, We have also been furnished with a large number of printed opinions approving the policy of the minimum wage, and our own reading has disclosed a large number to the contrary. These are all proper enough for the consideration of the lawmaking bodies, since their tendency is to establish the desirability or undesirability of the \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 560]\n\u00a0\n legislation; but they reflect no legitimate light upon the question of its validity, and that is what we are called upon to decide. The elucidation of that question cannot be aided by counting heads.\n It is said that great benefits have resulted from the operation of such statutes, not alone in the District of Columbia but in the several states where they have been in force. A mass of reports, opinions of special observers and students of the subject, and the like, has been brought before us in support of this statement, all of which we have found interesting, but only mildly persuasive. That the earnings of women are now greater than they were formerly, and that conditions affecting women have become better in other respects, may be conceded; but convincing indications of the logical relation of these desirable changes to the law in question are significantly lacking. They may be, and quite probably are, due to other causes. We cannot close our eyes to the notorious fact that earnings everywhere in all occupations have greatly increased-not alone in states where the minimum wage law obtains but in the country generally- quite as much or more among men as among women, and in occupations outside the reach of the law as in those governed by it. No real test of the economic value of the law can be had during periods of maximum employment, when general causes keep wages up to or above the minimum; that will come in periods of depression and struggle for employment, when the efficient will be employed at the minimum rate, while the less capable may not be employed at all.\n Finally, it may be said that if, in the interest of the public welfare, the police power may be invoked to justify the fixing of a minimum wage, it may, when the public welfare is thought to require it, be invoked to justify a maximum wage. The power to fix high wages connotes, by like course of reasoning, the power to fix low wages. If, in the face of the guaranties of the Fifth \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 561]\n\u00a0\n Amendment, this form of legislation shall be legally justified, the field for the operation of the police power will have been widened to a great and dangerous degree. If, for example, in the opinion of future lawmakers, wages in the building trades shall become so high as to preclude people of ordinary means from building and owning homes, an authority which sustains the minimum wage will be invoked to support a maximum wage or building laborers and artisans, and the same argument which has been here urged to strip the employer of his constitutional liberty of contract in one direction will be utilized to strip the employee of his constitutional liberty of contract in the opposite direction. A wrong decision does not end with itself; it is a precedent, and, with the swing of sentiment, its bad influence may run from one extremity of the arc to the other.\n It has been said that legislation of the of contract in the opposite direction. A of social justice, for whose ends freedom of contract may lawfully be subjected to restraint. The liberty of the individual to do as he pleases, even in innocent matters, is not absolute. It must frequently yield to the common good, and the line beyond which the power of interference may not be pressed is neither definite nor unalterable, but may be made to move, within limits not well defined, with changing need and circumstance. Any attempt to fix a rigid boundary would be unwise as well as futile. But, nevertheless, there are limits to the power, and, when these have been passed, it becomes the plain duty of the courts in the proper exercise of their authority to so declare. To sustain the individual freedom of action contemplated by the Constitution is not to strike down the common good, but to exalt it; for surely the good of society as a whole cannot be better served than by the preservation against arbitrary restraint of the liberties of its constituent members. \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 562]\n\u00a0\n It follows, from what has been said, that the act in question passes the limit prescribed by the Constitution, and accordingly the decrees of the court below are\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT, dissenting.\n I regret much to differ from the court in these cases.\n The boundary of the police power beyond which its exercise becomes an invasion of the guaranty of liberty under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitutions is not easy to mark. Our court has been laboriously engaged in pricking out a line in successive cases. We must be careful, it seems to me, to follow that line as well as we can, and not to depart from it by suggesting a distinction that is formal rather than real.\n Legislatures in limiting freedom of contract between employee and employer by a minimum wage proceed on the assumption that employees, in the class receiving least pay, are not upon a full level of equality of choice with their employer and in their necessitous circumstances are prone to accept pretty much anything that is offered. They are peculiarly subject to the overreaching of the harsh and greedy employer. The evils of the sweating system and of the long hours and low wages which are characteristic of it are well known. Now, I agree that it is a disputable question in the field of political economy how far a statutory requirement of maximum hours or minimum wages may be a useful remedy for these evils, and whether it may not make the case of the oppressed employee worse than it was before. But it is not the function of this court to hold congressional acts invalid simply because they are passed to carry out economic views which the court believes to be unwise or unsound. \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 563]\n\u00a0\n Legislatures which adopt a requirement of maximum hours or minimum wages may be presumed to believe that when sweating employers are prevented from paying unduly low wages by positive law they will continue their business, abating that part of their profits, which were wrung from the necessities of their employees, and will concede the better terms required by the law, and that while in individual cases, hardship may result, the restriction will inure to the benefit of the general class of employees in whose interest the law is passed, and so to that of the community at large.\n The right of the Legislature under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to limit the hours of employment on the score of the health of he employee, it seems to me, has been firmly established. As to that, one would think, the line had been pricked out so that it has become a well formulated rule. In Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 383, it was applied to miners and rested on the unfavorable environment of employment in mining and smelting. In Lochner v. New York, \n198 U.S. 45\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 539, 3 Ann. Cas. 1133, it was held that restricting those employed in bakeries to 10 hours a day was an arbitrary and invalid interference with the liberty of contract secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Then followed a number of cases beginning with Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957, sustaining the validity of a limit on maximum hours of labor for women to which I shall hereafter allude, and following these cases came Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 U.S. 426\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 435, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1043. In that case, this court sustained a law limiting the hours of labor of any person, whether man or woman, working in any mill, factory, or manufacturing establishment to 10 hours a day with a proviso as to further hours to which I shall hereafter advert. The law covered the whole field of industrial employment and certainly covered the case of persons employed in bakeries. Yet the opinion in the Bunting Case does not mention the Lochner Case. No one can \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 564]\n\u00a0\n suggest any constitutional distinction between employment in a bakery and one in any other kind of a manufacturing establishment which should make a limit of hours in the one invalid, and the same limit in the other permissible. It is impossible for me to reconcile the Bunting Case and the Lochner Case, and I have always supposed that the Lochner Case was thus overruled sub silentio. Yet the opinion of the court herein in support of its conclusion quotes from the opinion in the Lochner Case as one which has been sometimes distinguished but never overruled. Certainly there was no attempt to distinguish it in the Bunting Case.\n However, the opinion herein does not overrule the Bunting Case in express terms, and therefore. I assume that the conclusion in this case rests on the distinction between a minimum of wages and a maximum of hours in the limiting of liberty to contract. I regret to be at variance with the court as to the substance of this distinction. In absolute freedom of contract the one term is as important as the other, for both enter equally into the consideration given and received, a restriction as to one is not any greater in essence than the other, and is of the same kind. One is the multiplier and the other the multiplicand.\n If it be said that long hours of labor have a more direct effect upon the health of the employee than the low wage, there is very respectable authority from close observers, disclosed in the record and in the literature on the subject quoted at length in the briefs that they are equally harmful in this regard. Congress took this view and we cannot say it was not warranted in so doing.\n With deference to the very able opinion of the court and my brethren who concur in it, it appears to me to exaggerate the importance of the wage term of the contract of employment as more inviolate than its other terms. Its conclusion seems influenced by the fear that the \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 565]\n\u00a0\n concession of the power to impose a minimum wage must carry with it a concession of the power to fix a maximum wage. This, I submit, is a non sequitur. A line of distinction like the one under discussion in this case is, as the opinion elsewhere admits, a matter of degree and practical experience and not of pure logic. Certainly the wide difference between prescribing a minimum wage and a maximum wage could as a matter of degree and experience be easily affirmed.\n Moreover, there are decisions by this court which have sustained legislative limitations in respect to the wage term in contracts of employment. In McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 539\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 206, 53 L. d. 315, it was held within legislative power to make it unlawful to estimate the graduated pay of miners by weight after screening the coal. In Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 U.S. 13\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 1, it was held that stores orders issued for wages must be redeemable in cash. In Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 U.S. 169\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 821, a law forbidding the payment of wages in advance was held valid. A like case is Strathearn S. S. Co. v. Dillon, \n252 U.S. 348\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 350. While these did not impose a minimum on wages, they did take away from the employee the freedom to agree as to how they should be fixed, in what medium they should be paid, and when they should be paid, all features that might affect the amount or the mode of enjoyment of them. The first two really rested on the advantage the employer had in dealing with the employee. The third was deemed a proper curtailment of a sailor's right of contract in his own interest because of his proneness to squander his wages in port before sailing. In Bunting v. Oregon, supra, employees in a mill, factory, or manufacturing establishment were required if they worked over 10 hours a day to accept for the 3 additional hours permitted not less than 50 per cent, more than their usual wage. This was sustained as a mild penalty imposed on the employer to enforce the limitation as to hours; but it necessarily \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 566]\n\u00a0\n curtailed the employee's freedom to contract to work for the wages he saw fit to accept during those 3 hours. I do not feel, therefore, that either on the basis of reason, experience, or authority, the boundary of the police power should be drawn to include maximum hours and exclude a minimum wage.\n Without, however, expressing an opinion that a minimum wage limitation can be enacted for adult men, it is enough to say that the case before us involves only the application of the minimum wage to women. If I am right in thinking that the Legislature can find as much support in experience for the view that a sweating wage has as great and as direct a tendency to bring about an injury to the health and morals of workers, as for the view that long hours injure their health, then I respectfully submit that Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957, controls this case. The law which was there sustained forbade the employment of any female in any mechanical establishment or factory or laundry for more than 10 hours. This covered a pretty wide field in women's work, and it would not seem that any sound distinction between that case, and this can be built up on the fact that the law before us applies to all occupations of women with power in the board to make certain exceptions. Mr. Justice Brewer, who spoke for the court in Muller v. Oregon, based its conclusion on the natural limit to women's physical strength and the likelihood that long hours would therefore injure her health, and we have had since a series of cases which may be said to have established a rule of decision. Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 U.S. 671\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 469; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 U.S. 373\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 U.S. 385\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 345. The cases covered restrictions in wide and varying fields of employment and in the later cases it will be found that the objection to the particular law was based, not on the ground that it had general application, but because it left out some employments. \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 567]\n\u00a0\n I am not sure from a reading of the opinion whether the court thinks the authority of Muller v. Oregon is shaken by the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment. The Nineteenth Amendment did not change the physical strength or limitations of women upon which the decision in Muller v. Oregon rests. The amendment did give women political power and makes more certain that legislative provisions for their protection will be in accord with their interests as they see them. But I do not think we are warra ted in varying constitutional construction based on physical differences between men and women, because of the amendment.\n But for my inability to agree with some general observations in the forcible opinion of Mr. Justice HOLMES, who follows me, I should be silent and merely record my concurrence in what he says. It is perhaps wiser for me, however, in a case of this importance separately to give my reasons for dissenting.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n The question in this case is the broad one, Whether Congress can establish minimum rates of wages for women in the District of Columbia with due provision for special circumstances, or whether we must say that Congress had no power to meddle with the matter at all. To me, notwithstanding the deference due to the prevailing judgment of the Court, the power of Congress seems absolutely free from doubt. The end, to remove conditions leading to ill health, immorality and the deterioration of the race, no one would deny to be within the scope of constitutional legislation. The means are means that have the approval of Congress, of many States, and of those governments from which we have learned our greatest \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 568]\n\u00a0\n lessons. When so many intelligent persons, who have studied the matter more than any of us can, have thought that the means are effective and are worth the price it seems to me impossible to deny that the belief reasonably may be held by reasonable men. If the law encountered no other objection than that the means bore no relation to the end or that they cost too much I do not suppose that anyone would venture to say that it was bad. I agree, of course, that a law answering the foregoing requirements might be invalidated by specific provisions of the Constitution. For instance it might take private property without just compensation. But in the present instance the only objection that can be urged is found within the vague contours of the Fifth Amendment, prohibiting the depriving any person of liberty or property without due process of law. To that I turn.\n The earlier decisions upon the same words in the Fourteenth Amendment began within our memory and went no farther than an unpretentious assertion of the liberty to follow the ordinary callings. Later that innocuous generality was expanded into the dogma, Liberty of Contract. Contract is not specially mentioned in the text that we have to construe. It is merely an example of doing what you want to do, embodied in the word liberty. But pretty much all law consists in forbidding men to do some things that they want to do, and contract is no more exempt from law than other acts. Without enumerating all the restrictive laws that have been upheld I will mention a few that seem to me to have interfered with liberty of contract quite as seriously and directly as the one before us. Usury laws prohibit contracts by which a man receives more than so much interest for the money that he lends. Statutes of frauds restrict many contracts to certain forms. Some Sunday laws prohibit practically all contracts during one-seventh of our whole life. Insurance rates may be regulated. German Alliance Ins. Co. \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 569]\n\u00a0\n v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189. (I concurred in that decision without regard to the public interest with which insurance was said to be clothed. It seemed to me that the principle was general.) Contracts may be forced upon the companies. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 U.S. 71\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 32, 67 L. Ed. --, November 13, 1922. Employers of miners may be required to pay for coal by weight before screening. McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 539\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 206. Employers generally may be required to redeem in cash store orders accepted by their employees in payment. Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 U.S. 13\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 1. Payment of sailors in advance may be forbidden. Patterson v. The Eudora, \n90 U.S. 169\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 821. The size of a loaf of bread may be established. Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 U.S. 578\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 182, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 284. The responsibility of employers to their employees may be profoundly modified. New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537. Finally women's hours of labor may be fixed, Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671, 679\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 469; Hawley v. Walker, \n232 U.S. 718\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 479; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 U.S. 373\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 U.S. 385\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 345; and the principle was extended to men with the allowance of a limited overtime to be paid for 'at the rate of time and one-half of the regular wage,' in Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 U.S. 426\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 435, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1043\n\n\n I confess that I do not understand the principle on which the power to fix a minimum for the wages of women can be denied by those who admit the power to fix a maximum for their hours of work. I fully assent to the proposition that here as elsewhere the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree, but I perceive no difference in the kind or degree of interference with liberty, the only matter with which we have any concern, between the one case and the other. The bargain is equally affected whichever half you regulate. Muller v. Oregon, I take it, is as good law today as it was in 1908. It will \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 570]\n\u00a0\n need more than the Nineteenth Amendment to convince me that there are no differences between men and women, or that legislation cannot take those differences into account. I should not hesitate to take them into account if I thought it necessary to sustain this Act. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 192. But after Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 U.S. 426\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 435, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1043, I had supposed that it was not necessary, and that Lochner v. New York, \n198 U.S. 45\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 539, 3 Ann. Cas. 1133, would be allowed a deserved repose.\n This statute does not compel anybody to pay anything. It simply forbids employment at rates below those fixed as the minimum requirement of health and right living. It is safe to assume that women will not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed unless they earn them, or unless the employer's business can sustain the burden. In short the law in its character and operation is like hundreds of so-called police laws that have been upheld. I see no greater objection to using a Board to apply the standard fixed by the Act than there is to the other commissions with which we have become familiar or than there is to the requirement of a license in other cases. The fact that the statute warrants classification, which like all classifications may bear hard upon some individuals, or in exceptional cases, notwithstanding the power given to the Board to issue a special license, is no greater infirmity than is incident to all law. But the ground on which the law is held to fail is fundamental and therefore it is unnecessary to consider matters of detail.\n The criterion of constitutionality is not whether we believe the law to be for the public good. We certainly cannot be prepared to deny that a reasonable man reasonably might have that belief in view of the legislation of Great Britain, Victoria and a number of the States of this Union. The belief is fortified by a very remarkable collection of documents submitted on behalf of the appellants, material here, I conceive, only as showing that the \n\n[261 U.S. 525, 571]\n\u00a0\n belief reasonably may be held. In Australia the power to fix a minimum for wages in the case of industrial disputes extendi g beyond the limits of any one State was given to a Court, and its President wrote a most interesting account of its operation. 29 Harv. Law Rev. 13. If a legislature should adopt what he thinks the doctrine of modern economists of all schools, that 'freedom of contract is a misnomer as applied to a contract between an employer and an ordinary individual employee,' Ibid. 25, I could not pronounce an opinion with which I agree impossible to be entertained by reasonable men. If the same legislature should accept his further opinion that industrial peace was best attained by the device of a Court having the above powers, I should not feel myself able to contradict it, or to deny that the end justified restrictive legislation quite as adequately as beliefs concerning Sunday or exploded theories about usury. I should have my doubts, as I have them about this statute-but they would be whether the bill that has to be paid for every gain, although hidden as interstitial detriments, was not greater than the gain was worth: a matter that it is not for me to decide.\n I am of opinion that the statute is valid and that the decree should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is the exact situation in the Lyons Case, as is shown by the statement in the first part of this opinion. \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAKTIESELSKABET FIDO v.

AMERICAN SURETY CO. OF NEW YORK(1922)\nNo. 118\nArgued: November 24, 1922Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry Uttal, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullett, of Louisville, Ky., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a question of procedure and turns on the construction of equity rule 30 (33 Sup. Ct. xxvi). An understanding of the point at issue requires a statement of the facts and the course of the litigation.\n In September, 1918, the Hartenfeld Bag Company, which was in a failing condition, owed the American Mills Company, the petitioner, about $ 22,000, which it was unable to pay. The Mills Company and the Bag Company made a contract, the performance of which by the Bag Company the American Surety Company guaranteed. The contract recited that the Mills Company had paid in advance to the Bag Company $22,100 for which the Bag Company was to deliver certain merchandise within 75 days, and in default of this delivery, the money was to be returned. The Bag Company delivered only $1, 500 worth of goods and then went into bankruptcy. The fact was that the Mills Company had never made the advance payment of $22,000 recited in the contract, but instead of that, some days after the execution of the contract, the Mills Company and the Bag Company exchanged checks for a little less than this amount in order to create the appearance of a genuine transaction. The effect of what was done was that the Mills Company received a guaranty from the Surety Company of a bad debt, while the latter company thought it was insuring the performance of a bona fide contract of sale and delivery of goods by the Bag Company for which that company had received the full purchase price in advance. In December, 1918, after demand for payment \n\n[260 U.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n and refusal, the Mills Company, a corporation of Georgia, sued the Surety Company, a corporation of New York, on its guaranty in a state court in Georgia and in a state court in Illinois. In March, 1919, the Surety Company, before appearing in the Georgia or Illinois courts, filed the suit at bar in a state court in New York against the Mills Company seeking to cancel the guaranty on the ground of fraud and to enjoin its enforcement. The Mills Company removed the cause to the equity side of the District Court below, and then filed an answer and counterclaim in which it denied the alleged fraud and pleaded as a separate and distinct defense that the Surety Company had an adequate remedy at law by setting up the alleged fraud as an answer to the suits in Georgia and Illinois, and second, 'as a separate and distinct counterclaim to the cause of action alleged in the complaint,' set up the execution of the guaranty, the default thereunder, notice to the Surety Company, demand for payment, refusal thereof, and a prayer 'for judgment against the plaintiff on defendant's counterclaim for the sum of $21,050 with interest.' Thereafter the Mills Company twice moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law and these motions were denied without prejudice to such action as the trial court might deem advisable. When the cause came on for hearing the Surety Company introduced proof of the fraud. The Mills Company introduced no evidence on the issue of fraud, but made proof of the execution of the guaranty and the facts subsequent thereto to show the liability of the Surety Company and put the contract of guaranty in evidence. The court directed that it be delivered to the clerk and impounded. After both sides had rested in the case, the court called for an argument on the law of the case, announcing with emphasis that the fraud had been clearly shown. The court entered a decree canceling the guaranty, holding \n\n[260 U.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n that the defendant had waived his defense that there was an adequate remedy at law and had thereby given the court of equity jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for by cancellation of the guaranty. American Surety Co. v. American Mills Co., 262 Fed. 691. On appeal, the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 273 Fed. 68.\n It is conceded by the respondent that its bill in equity in the District Court should have been dismissed because it had an adequate remedy at law. The cases of Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616, 622, and Cable v. U. S. Life Insurance Co., \n191 \nU.S. 288, 306\n, 307 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 74, settle that. Respondent therefore relies solely on the waiver of this defect by the Mills Company in doing what it did in the District Court. A defendant in a bill of equity may waive such a defect. McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 543; Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90, 109\n, 110 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 219; Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 380\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 127; Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 486; 1 Daniell's Ch. Pr. (4th Am. Ed.) 555.\n Did petitioner waive it? It made the objection seasonably both by answer and by motions to dismiss. The motions were denied without prejudice to their renewal when the cause should come on for hearing before the trial court. The defendant, instead of renewing its motion to dismiss or insisting on the sufficiency of the first defense of its answer, introduced proof of its right to an affirmative judgment for the full amount of the guaranty, putting the written instrument in evidence. This certainly constituted a waiver unless the contention of the defendant, the petitioner here, that equity rule 30 required it to put in proof of its claim on penalty of being barred from prosecuting it at law, is sound.\n The relevant part of rule 30 is as follows:\n'The answer must state in short and simple form any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the \n\n[260 U.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n subject-matter of the suit, and may, without cross-bill, set out any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiffs which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him, and such set- off or counterclaim so set up shall have the same effect as a cross- suit, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment in the same suit both on the original and cross claims.' (Italics mine.)\n\n The petitioner argues that must any may are here set over against one another for the purpose of enforcing the intention and effect of the rule to require the defendant in an action in equity to set out any counterclaim arising out of the subject-matter of the bill, but to leave it to the option of the defendant whether a counterclaim or set-off not arising out of the same transaction shall be interposed or shall be prosecuted by independent bill. The respondent contends that, while this may be correct, the counterclaim growing out of the same transaction must be an equitable claim, and not a legal one, as here. We concur in this view.\n The new equity rules were intended to simplify equity pleading and practice by limiting the pleadings to a statement of ultimate facts without evidence and by uniting in one action as many issues as could conveniently be disposed of. But they normally deal with subjects-matter of which, under the dual system of law and equity, courts of equity can properly take cognizance. They certainly were not drawn to change in any respect the line between law and equity as made by the federal statutes, practice and decisions when the rules were promulgated. By the construction which petitioner would put upon rule 30, it is an attempt to compel one who has a cause of action at law to bring it into a court of equity and then try it without a jury whenever the defendant in that cause can find some head of equity jurisdiction under which he can apply for equitable relief in respect of the subject-matter. The order of procedure as between the law and equity \n\n[260 U.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n sides in such cases always has been that the equity issue is first disposed of by the chancellor and then, unless that ends the litigation, the original plaintiff may have his action at law and his trial by jury secured him by the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, \n260 U.S. 235\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 118, 67 L. Ed. --, decided November 26, 1922. Petitioner's construction of rule No. 30 would deny the successful defendant in the equity action this right. Petitioner seeks to avoid the dilemma by the suggestion that the rule would be satisfied by merely pleading the action at law without proving it, but this would be futile. The counterclaim referred to in the first part of the paragraph must therefore be an equitable counterclaim, one which like the set-off or counterclaim referred to in the next clause could be made the subject of an independent bill in equity. The counterclaim and the set- off and counterclaim in the two clauses are in pari materia except that the first grows out of the subject-matter of the bill and the other does not. That which grows out of the subject-matter of the bill must be set up in the interest of an end of litigation. That which does not may be set up if the defendant wishes in one proceeding in equity quickly to settle all equitable issues capable of trial between them in such a proceeding, even though they are not related. Buffalo Specialty Co. v. Vancleef (D. C.) 217 Fed. 91. The formality of cross-bills is not required, and the rule goes as far as possible to facilitate the prompt disposition of equitable controversies between the same litigants. The rule should be liberally construed to carry out its evident purpose of shortening litigation, but the limitation of counterclaims to those which are equitable is imperative. Equity rule 30 was evidently suggested by order XIX, rule 3, of the English Practice, but, as the division between equity and law jurisdictions does not now obtain in the English courts, the England rule applies to all actions either at law or in \n\n[260 U.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n equity (Hopkins' Federal Equity Rules [3d Ed.] p. 195), and consideration of it does not aid us in the question we are discussing.\n The result is that the petitioner as defendant was not obliged to set up and prove its action at law under rule 30, and when it did so, by its affirmative action, it waived its previous objection to the equitable jurisdiction and also its right of trial by jury. An analogous effect of such affirmative action in pressing a counterclaim is seen in Merchants Heat & Light Co. v. J. B. Clow & Sons, \n204 \nU.S. 286, 289\n, 290 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 285, where a nonresident corporation, having saved its right to object to the service of summons, lost it, not by answer, but by a counterclaim.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN SMELTING & REFINING CO. v. U S(1922)\nNo. 221\nArgued: April 25, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 75, 76]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. B. King and Geo. A. King, both of Washington, D. C., and Charles Earl, of New York City, for appellant.\n Wm. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim for $512,515.50, being the price of 20,500,620 pounds of copper at 26 cents a pound less payments received at 23 1\/2 cents. The petition was dismissed by the Court of Claims on demurrer. The facts alleged are as follows. The Government had some correspondence with the United Metals Selling Company ending in an order or proposal for 30,000 metric tons of copper for the French Government to be delivered on or before June 1, 1918. To this the Company replied on March 26, 1918, that the Copper Producers Committee had divided the handling of copper and had given the export business to the American Smelting and Refining Company. The letter requested that the order be changed to apply to the last-named company and concluded 'they tell us that it will quite fit in with their operations to handle this present order along \n\n[259 U.S. 75, 77]\n\u00a0\n with the other shipments.' Thereupon, on March 28, 1918, a letter was written by the Ordnance Department to the American Smelting & Refining Company, 'to advise you that the Procurement Division is prepared to procure from you 30,000 metric tons (66,138,000 pounds) of copper at a price of 23 1\/2 c. per pound net, f. o. b. New York basis. Deliveries are to be completed on or before June 1, 1918'; shipping instructions to be taken up with the Supply Division, Ordnance Department; with further particulars not material and ending, 'Your acceptance of this letter is requested pending issuance of formal contract which will go forward in a few days.' The representative of the claimant seems to have delayed an answer in the hope of adjusting one or two details but on April 11, wrote:\n'We have your favor March 28th ... and take pleasure in accepting your letter as above pending issuance of formal contract which we hope to receive in the near future.'\n\n The copper except the 20,500,620 pounds, was delivered before July 2, 1918, has been paid for and no question is raised about it. But it was practically impossible to deliver this last amount until after that date and no shipping orders for it were received until a later time. It was delivered finally and the claim for the advanced price is based upon the facts and arguments that we shall state.\n At the time when the order was accepted the Price-Fixing Committee of the War Industries Board, an agency of the Council of National Defence, had fixed the price of copper at 23 1\/2 cents per pound f. o. b. New York, under the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418,  2, 39 Stat. 619, 649 (Comp. St .  3115a-3115e), and the authority of the President. On July 2, 1918, the price was advanced to 26 cents per pound. The National Defence Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134,  120, 39 Stat. 166, 213 (Comp. St.  3115f-3115h), had author ized the President in time of war 'in addition to the present authorized methods of purchase or procurement, to place an order' for material required, \n\n[259 U.S. 75, 78]\n\u00a0\n made compliance with such orders obligatory under a penalty, and gave them precedence. The compensation paid was to be fair and just. The position of the claimant is that although the language of contract was used, it was yielding to the requirements of the statute and is entitled to the fair price that the statute promised. The fair price, it contends, for copper delivered after the change of July 2, is 26 cents, because the delay is alleged to have been due to the failure of the Government to send shipping orders and to the fact that further deliveries were made impossible for the time by the Government's appropriating all the copper available to other uses. It also argues that there was no valid contract, since the agreement was not made by advertising and was not within the exception when the public exigencies require immediate delivery. Rev. St.  3709 ( Comp. St.  6832).\n We may lay the latter objection on one side. There can be no question that the war created a public exigency and it would be going far to deny that the contract was for a delivery as immediate as was practicable for the subject-matter. Moreover the statutory requirements were for the protection of the United States, not to the seller. United States v. New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co., \n239 U.S. 88\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 41. Of course the expressed contemplation of a more formal document did not prevent the letters from having the effect that otherwise they would have had. The only serious argument is the supposed duress. But that can not prevail. It may be true that the claimant was yielding to the statute in a general way and did not discriminate between what it was required to yield and what it could reserve. But if it had desired to stand upon its legal rights it should have saved the question of the price. It did not do so, but on the contrary so far as appears was willing to contract and was content in the main with what was offered. As was pointed out by the Court of Claims, the acceptance was sent because \n\n[259 U.S. 75, 79]\n\u00a0\n the claimant was advised by the Government that no payment could be made until the claimant had accepted in writing the Government's proposal, whereas no acceptance was necessary if the order was a compulsory requisition. We are of opinion that the claimant must stand upon the letters of March 28 and April 11.\n The claimant argues that under its contract it was set free by the delay in shipping orders, and that although it did not refuse to proceed on that account, the omission should be credited to patriotism, not to a waiver of legal rights. But whatever the motives for its conduct the claimant kept the contract on foot. It even is said to have requested to be allowed to continue deliveries after June 1. Its claim if any must be for damages on the ground that the United States did not perform its part of the contract on time. Such a claim is not necessarily waived by completing performance. St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 159, 164\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 47. But the petition is framed on the theory that there was no contract but a requisition under the above mentioned Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134,  120, and that the claimant is entitled to just compensation by that section and by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. This we hold to be a mistake. Whether any claim for damages could be urged is not before us; the petition discloses grounds for doubt at least. Our judgment excludes any remedy under the Act of March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15a-3115 14\/15e), providing for supplies and services furnished under agreements not executed in the manner prescribed by law. We have said nothing about repeated requests that the claimant should sign a formal contract, its refusals, and its ultimate signing under protest, because these facts in no way modify the relation of the parties under the contract by letters already made.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHAFALAYA LAND CO. v.

Pharr and Frank B. Williams, of which the F. B. Williams Cypress Company became grantee May 23, 1903, and that the lands of the patents be adjudged to have been included in the grant of the state to the Board of Commissioners of the Atchafalaya \n\n[258 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n Basin Levee District anterior to the patent to Pharr and Williams, and by the Board of Commissioners transferred to Edward Wisner and J. M. Dresser, under a contract dated July, 1900, confirmed April 11, 1904, and by them to the Land Company.\n It was prayed that the Board of Commissioners be cited to join in the vindication of the Land Company's rights. The Board responded to the citation by intervening, answering and joining in the prayer of the bill. The other plaintiff in error also intervened.\n The answer of the Cypress Company brought into the case a statute of limitations of the state approved July 5, 1912 (Act. La. 1912, No. 62), that prescribes the time of bringing suits which attack patents from the state, or any transfer of property by any subdivision of the state. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This suit was not brought within the time prescribed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The following are the other facts, stated narratively:\n The state of Louisiana is the grantee under the acts of Congress of 1849 (9 Stat. 352) and 1850 (9 Stat. 519, Comp. St.  4958-4960) of the swamp and overflowed lands in the state.\n The state in 1890 (Acts La. 1890, No. 97) created the Board of Commissioners of the Atchafalaya Basin Levee District \n\n[258 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n and constituted it a corporate body. The Act created the Levee District and declared that all lands in the District then belonging to the state or that might thereafter be acquired, were thereby granted to the Board of Commissioners of the District. And it was further provided, to accommodate the time for redemption of the lands sold for taxes, even those forfeited for nonpayment, after the expiration of six months from the passage of the Act, that it should be the duty of the state auditor and the register of the state land office to convey the lands to the Board of Commissioners whenever requested to do so by the Board or its president, and that after the recording of the instruments of conveyance the title and possession of the lands should vest absolutely in the Board, its successors or grantees.\n This request was not made, but the Board nevertheless sold to Edward Wisner and John M. Dresser, the lands in controversy and bound itself in the instrument of conveyance 'to lend itself, with all its rights, powers and privileges and prerogatives to perfect its title, or the title acquired under this agreement to all lands to which it could have, and Wisner and Dresser can now justly lay claim to, and to do so whenever so requested. ...'\n The Land Company has become the assignee and representatives of Wisner and Dresser with their rights. The Lumber Company has acquired rights to the timber on the land and to that extent claims to be entitled to call for a conveyance.\n The Board of Commissioners, in view of having bound itself to make deed to Wisner and Dresser, unites with the Land Company and the Lumber Company, as we have said, to seek the relief desired by them, which includes the cancellation of patents issued to the partnership composed of John N. Pharr and F. B. Williams (of which the Williams Cypress Company is grantee) and the recognition of title in the land and the Lumber Companies. \n\n[258 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n To the cause of action thus stated, the Cypress Company pleaded the statute of the state heretofore referred to limiting the time of suit.\n In reply to the plea of the statute the Land Company and interveners averred that its application would violate the Constitution of the United States in that it would deprive them of their property without due process of law, and would impair the obligation of the contract entered into between the state and the Board of Commissioners of the Levee District and Wisner and Dresser and their assignees.\n The specification of this effect is that the grant from the state to the Board of Land Commissioners took from the state the right to otherwise dispose of the lands, and further, that the right to acquire by transfer from the state was perpetual, and that this right constituted a contract, and the right to demand perfection of the title was in the Board of Commissioners or its assignees, and that these rights were the obligation of the contract, and would be violated by the prescription act.\n The trial court (Nineteenth judicial district court in and for the parish of Iberia) accepted this view and adjudged to the Land Company and interveners, the relief and judgment prayed for.\n Upon appeal of the Cypress Company the Supreme Court reversed the decree and adjudged that the plea of prescription should have been sustained, and that the demands of the Land Company and interveners should have been denied and rejected.\n The court recited the facts, as we have stated them, and that within six months after the statute was passed (July 8, 1890) granting the lands to the Board of Commissioners, Pharr and Williams made cash purchases of the lands now in controversy and obtained the patents in contest which were promptly recorded. The court stated further that Pharr sold his interest in the lands to Williams in 1892 \n\n[258 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n and Williams sold the lands to the Cypress Company in 1903 and the deed was duly recorded, and that company immediately went into possession of the lands and exercised ownership upon them, and has ever since exercised ownership in various ways to the date of filing its answer, and it and its grantors have since 1890 paid the taxes on the lands. The court pointed out that no instrument of conveyance was ever made to the Board of Commissioners nor was there any request made for the same as provided for in the act of 1890.\n The court decided these were indispensable conditions and, they not having been performed, no indefeasible title passed or could pass to the board or its assignees. Or to quote the court, it quoting a state decision, 'the Board of Commissioners of the Levee District could not convey a perfect title, or a title indefeasible at the instant of the state for any land in the district before the board had obtained and recorded an instrument of conveyance of the land, in the manner required by the statute creating the levee district,' and that until such time 'the lands remained under legislative control by the state, as well after as before the Board of Commissioners contracted with Wisner and Dresser.' The conclusion of the court was that 'the Legislature, therefore, had power, at any time, to limit the time within which the Board of Commissioners of the Levee District could lay claim to the lands that had been disposed of by the state directly in favor of individuals or private corporations,' and that this power was exercised by the act of prescription. It was the decision of the court, therefore, that plaintiffs in error's predecessors, Wisner and Dresser, did not acquire a vested interest in the lands as plaintiffs in error contend.\n Plaintiffs in error vigorously contest the conclusions of the court and contend that they are contrary to prior decisions. The exigencies of the case do not call for an arbitration of the contest. We are concerned alone with the \n\n[258 U.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n power of the state to pass the statute of limitations of 1912, and we agree with the Supreme Court that such statutes are valid if they allow a reasonable time after their enactment, for the assertion of an existing right or the enforcement of an existing obligation, and certainly the condition was satisfied by the statute of 1912. Besides, having over six years after its enactment to assert their rights, plaintiffs in error, adding their time and that of their predecessors, had nearly a quarter of a century to confirm and fix whatever rights they had to the lands in controversy.\n Passing, however, all considerations of details and local aspects of the case, we are of the opinion that none of the invoked provisions of the Constitution of the United States are offended even under the construction plaintiffs in error give to the asserted grant to the Board of Commissioners and its conveyance to Wisner and Dresser. The act of prescription was a proper exercise of sovereignty. The state could recognize, as it did recognize, that there might be claims derived from it, asserted or to be asserted, rightfully or wrongfully, involving conflicts which should be decided and quieted in the public interest, and therefore, enacted the statute. And such is the rationale of statutes of limitations. They do not necessarily lessen rights of property or impair the obligation of contracts.

Wm. P. Bynum, of Greensboro, N. C., Wm. Hendren, of Winston- Salem, N.

The bill averred that Johnston, the son, was a minor between the ages of 14 and 16 years, that Johnston, the father, supporting his son, was entitled to his earnings until he attained his majority, that the son was in the employ of the defendant, that by the terms of the so-called Child Labor Tax Act, approved February 24, 1919, section 1200, 40 Stat. 1057, 1138 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 7\/8a), the defendant was subjected to a tax of one- tenth of its annual profits if it employed a child within the ages of 14 and 16 for more than 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, or before the hour of 6 a. m. or after the hour of 7 p. m.; that the defendant was unwilling to arrange a schedule of working hours to comply with this requirement for the minor complainant, and was about to discharge him because of the act, thus depriving the son and father of all of the son's earnings. On the ground that the act was invalid because beyond the powers of Congress, and that the discharge would injure both complainants by a serious deprivation of earnings, which but for the law they would enjoy, and that the granting of an injunction would prevent a multiplicity of suits, they prayed for an injunction against the defendant from discharging the complainant son or in any manner curtailing his employment to eight hours a day or otherwise. The defendant answered admitting all the substantial averments of the bill except the invalidity of the Child Labor Tax Act. It specifically admitted its intention to discharge the complainant son when the act went into effect and solely because of the act. On April 23, 1919, a motion for a preliminary injunction was heard. The United States attorney for the Western district of North Carolina not entering an appearance, but speaking as amicus curiae, suggested 'the want of jurisdiction because there is no allegation in the bill of a contract preventing the defendant \n\n[259 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n from discharging the employe for any reason that might seem fit to it, and also because the case is not one arising under the internal revenue or other federal laws so as to give the court jurisdiction to pass on the validity of the law.' The court granted the temporary injunction and made it permanent by order of May 2, 1919\n\n\n The defendant appealed directly to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), assigning error (1) to the failure to dismiss the bill; (2) to the holding that the Child Labor Tax Act was invalid; (3) to the injunction.\n The record shows that the pleadings were framed to bring this case within that of Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 38\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; but it differs from that case in that the sole defendant here is the employer, while in that case there was joined with the employer, the state officer who threatened to enforce the alleged invalid law against his codefendant and compel him to end the contract against his will and to the complainant's irreparable damage. The record further raises the doubt whether on its face this is a real case within the meaning of the Constitution upon which the judgment of this court upon the validity of an act of Congress under the Constitution can be invoked, and whether it does not violate the principle and ignore the caution of the words of Mr. Justice Brewer in Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 400, which are quoted in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 359\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 250. These are scrious questions requiring full consideration. We only state them in order that it may not be thought by our conclusion that we here decide them.\n The lapse of time since the case was heard and decided in the District Court has brought the minor, whose employment was the subject- matter of the suit, to an age which is not within the ages affected by the act. The act, even if valid, cannot affect him further. The case for an injunction has, therefore, become moot and we cannot \n\n[259 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n consider it. Mills v.

DREXEL FURNITURE CO.(1922)\nNo. 657\nArgued: March 8, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. P. Bynum, of Greensboro, N. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 20, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the constitutional validity of the Child Labor Tax Law. The plaintiff below, the Drexel Furniture Company, is engaged in the manufacture of furniture in the Western district of North Carolina. On September 20, 1921, it received a notice from Bailey, United States collector of internal revenue for the district, that it had been assessed $6,312.79 for having during the taxable year 1919 employed and permitted to work in its factory a boy under 14 years of age, thus incurring the tax of 10 per cent. on its net profits for that year. The company paid the tax under protest, and, after rejection of its claim for a refund, brought this suit. On demurrer to an amended complaint, judgment was entered for the company against the collector for the full amount, with interest. The writ of error is prosecuted by the collector direct from the District Court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n The Child Labor Tax Law is title No. XII of an act entitled 'An act to provide revenue and for other purposes,' approved February 24, 1919, 40 Stat. 1057, 1138 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 7\/8 a to 6336 7\/8 h). The heading of the title is 'Tax on Employment of Child Labor.' It begins with section 1200 and includes eight sections. Section 1200 is as follows:\n'Sec. 1200. That every person (other than a bona fide boys' or girls' canning club recognized by the agricultural department of a state and of the United States) operating (a) any mine or quarry situated in the United States in which children under the age of sixteen years have been employed or permitted to work during any portion of the taxable year; or (b) any mill, cannery, workshop, factory, or manufacturing establishment situated in the United States in which children under the age of fourteen years have been employed or permitted to \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 35]\n\u00a0\n work, or children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen have been employed or permitted to work more than eight hours in any day or more than six days in any week, or after the hour of seven o'clock post meridian, or before the hour of six o'clock ante meridian, during any portion of the taxable year, shall pay for each taxable year, in addition to all other taxes imposed by law, an excise tax equivalent to 10 per centum of the entire net profits received or accrued for such year from the sale or disposition of the product of such mine, quarry, mill, cannery, workship, factory, or manufacturing establishment.'\n\n Section 1203 relieves from liability to the tax any one who employs a child, believing him to be of proper age relying on a certificate to this effect issued by persons prescribed by a board consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the Secretary of Labor, or issued by state authorities. The section also provides in paragraph (b) that--\n'The tax imposed by this title shall not be imposed in the case of any person who proves to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the only employment or permission to work which but for this section would subject him to the tax, has been of a child employed or permitted to work under a mistake of fact as to the age of such child and without intention to evade the tax.'\n\n Section 1206 gives authority to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, or any other person authorized by him 'to enter and inspect at any time any mine, quarry, mill, cannery, workshop, factory or manufacturing establishment.' The Secretary of Labor, or any person whom he authorizes, is given like authority in order to comply with a request of the Commissioner to make such inspection and report the same. Any person who refuses entry or obstructs inspection is made subject to fine or imprisonment or both. \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 36]\n\u00a0\n The law is attacked on the ground that it is a regulation of the employment of child labor in the states-an exclusively state function under the federal Constitution and within the reservations of the Tenth Amendment. It is defendant on the ground that it is a mere excise tax levied by the Congress of the United States under its broad power of taxation conferred by section 8, article 1, of the federal Constitution. We must construe the law and interpret the intent and meaning of Congress from the language of the act. The words are to be given their ordinary meaning unless the context shows that they are differently used. Does this law impose a tax with only that incidental restraint and regulation which a tax must inevitably involve? Or does it regulate by the use of the so- called tax as a penalty? If a tax, it is clearly an excise. If it were an excise on a commodity or other thing of value, we might not be permitted under previous decisions of this court to infer solely from its heavy burden that the act intends a prohibition instead of a tax. But this act is more. It provides a heavy exaction for a departure from a detailed and specified course of conduct in business. That course of business is that employers shall employ in mines and quarries, children of an age greater than 16 years; in mills and factories, children of an age greater than 14 years, and shall prevent children of less than 16 years in mills and factories from working more than 8 hours a day or 6 days in the week. If an employer departs from this prescribed course of business, he is to pay to the government one-tenth of his entire net income in the business for a full year. The amount is not to be proportioned in any degree to the extent or frequency of the departures, but is to be paid by the employer in full measure whether he employs 500 children for a year, or employs only one for a day. Moreover, if he does not know the child is within the named age limit, he is not to pay; \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 37]\n\u00a0\n that is to say, it is only where he knowingly departs from the prescribed course that payment is to be exacted. Scienters are associated with penalties, not with taxes. The employer's factory is to be subject to inspection at any time not only by the taxing officers of the Treasury, the Department normally charged with the collection of taxes, but also by the Secretary of Labor and his subordinates, whose normal function is the advancement and protection of the welfare of the workers. In the light of these features of the act, a court must be blind not to see that the so- called tax is imposed to stop the employment of children within the age limits prescribed. Its prohibitory and regulatory effect and purpose are palpable. All others can see and understand this. How can we properly shut our minds to it?\n It is the high duty and function of this court in cases regularly brought to its bar to decline to recognize or enforce seeming laws of Congress, dealing with subjects not intrusted to Congress, but left or committed by the supreme law of the land to the control of the states. We cannot avoid the duty, even though it require us to refuse to give effect to legislation designed to promote the highest good. The good sought in unconstitutional legislation is an insidious feature, because it leads citizens and legislators of good purpose to promote it, without thought of the serious breach it will make in the ark of our covenant, or the harm which will come from breaking down recognized standards. In the maintenance of local self-government, on the one hand, and the national power, on the other, our country has been able to endure and prosper for near a century and a half.\n Out of a proper respect for the acts of a co-ordinate branch of the government, this court has gone far to sustain taxing acts as such, even though there has been ground for suspecting, from the weight of the tax, it was intended to destroy its subject. But in the act before \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 38]\n\u00a0\n us the presumption of validity cannot prevail, because the proof of the contrary is found on the very face of its provisions. Grant the validity of this law, and all that Congress would need to do, hereafter, in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number of subjects of public interest, jurisdiction of which the states have never parted with, and which are reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment, would be to enact a detailed measure of complete regulation of the subject and enforce it by a socalled tax upon departures from it. To give such magic to the word 'tax' would be to break down all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congress and completely wipe out the sovereignty of the states.\n The difference between a tax and a penalty is sometimes difficult to define, and yet the consequences of the distinction in the required method of their collection often are important. Where the sovereign enacting the law has power to impose both tax and penalty, the difference between revenue production and mere regulation may be immaterial, but not so when one sovereign can impose a tax only, and the power of regulation rests in another. Taxes are occasionally imposed in the discretion of the Legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive. But there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty, with the characteristics of regulation and punishment. Such is the case in the law before us. Although Congress does not invalidate the contract of employment or expressly declare that the employment within the mentioned ages is illegal, it does exhibit its intent practically to achieve the latter result by adopting the criteria of wrongdoing and imposing its principal consequence on those who transgress its standard. \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 39]\n\u00a0\n The case before us cannot be distinguished from that of Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 U.S. 251\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. A. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918 E, 724. Congress there enacted a law to prohibit gransportation in interstate commerce of goods made at a factory in which there was employment of children within the same ages and for the same number of hours a day and days in a week as are penalized by the act in this case. This court held the law in that case to be void. It said:\n'In our view the necessary effect of this act is, by means of a prohibition against the movement in interstate commerce of ordinary commercial commodities, to regulate the hours of labor of children in factories and mines within the states, a purely state authority.'\n\n In the case at the bar, Congress in the name of a tax which on the face of the act is penalty seeks to do the same thing, and the effort must be equally futile.\n The analogy of the Dagenhart Case is clear. The congressional power over interstate commerce is, within its proper scope, just as complete and unlimited as the congressional power to tax, and the legislative motive in its exercise is just as free from judicial suspicion and inquiry. Yet when Congress threatened to stop interstate commerce in ordinary and necessary commodities, unobjectionable as subjects of transportation, and to deny the same to the people of a state in order to coerce them into compliance with Congress' regulation of state concerns, the court said this was not in fact regulation of interstate commerce, but rather that of state concerns and was invalid. So here the so-called tax is a penalty to coerce people of a state to act as Congress wishes them to act in respect of a matter completely the business of the state government under the federal Constitution. This case requires as did the Dagenhart Case the application of the principle announced by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423 (4 L. Ed. 579), in a much-quoted passage: \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 40]\n\u00a0\n 'Should Congress, in the execution of its powers, adopt measures which are prohibited by the Constitution; or should Congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the government; it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a decision come before it, to say that such an act was not the law of the land.'\n But it is pressed upon us that this court has gone so far in sustaining taxing measures the effect and tendency of which was to accomplish purposes not directly within congressional power that we are bound by authority to maintain this law.\n The first of these is Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533. In that case, the validity of a law which increased a tax on the circulating notes of persons and state banks from one per centum to 10 per centum was in question. The main question was whether this was a direct tax to be apportioned among the several states 'according to their respective numbers.' This was answered in the negative. The second objection was stated by the court:\n'It is insisted, however, that the tax in the case before us is excessive, and so excessive as to indicate a purpose on the part of Congress to destroy the franchise of the bank, and is, therefore, beyond the constitutional power of Congress.'\n\n To this the court answered:\n'The first answer to this is that the judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative departments of the government limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons, but the responsibility of the Legislature is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its members are elected. So if a particular tax bears heavily upon a corporation, or a class of corporations, it cannot, for that reason only, be pronounced contrary to the Constitution.' \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 41]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that the sole objection to the tax here was its excessive character. Nothing else appeared on the face of the act. It was an increase of a tax admittedly legal to a higher rate and that was all. There were no elaborate specifications on the face of the act, as here, indicating the purpose to regulate matters of state concern and jurisdiction through an exaction so applied as to give it the qualities of a penalty for violation of law rather than a tax.\n\n It should be noted, too, that the court, speaking of the extent of the taxing power, used these cautionary words (8 Wall. 541):\n'There are, indeed, certain virtual limitations, arising from the principles of the Constitution itself. It would undoubtedly be an abuse of the power if so exercised as to impair the separate existence and independent self-government of the states, or if exercised for ends inconsistent with the limited grants of power in the Constitution.'\n\n But more than this, what was charged to be the object of the excessive tax was within the congressional authority, as appears from the second answer which the court gave to the objection. After having pointed out the legitimate means taken by Congress to secure a national medium or currency, the court said (8 Wall. 549):\n'Having thus, in the exercise of undisputed constitutional powers, undertaken to provide a currency for the whole country, it cannot be questioned that Congress may, constitutionally, secure the benefit of it to the people by appropriate legislation. To this end, Congress has denied the quality of legal tender to foreign coins, and has provided by law against the imposition of counterfeit and base coin on the community. To the same end, Congress may restrain, by suitable enactments, the circulation as money of any notes not issued under its own authority. Without this power, indeed, its attempts to secure \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 42]\n\u00a0\n a sound and uniform currency for the country must be futile.'\n\n The next case is that of McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561. That, like the Veazie Bank Case, was the increase of an excise tax upon a subject properly taxable in which the taxpayers claimed that the tax had become invalid because the increase was excessive. It was a tax on oleomargarine, a substitute for butter. The tax on the white oleomargarine was one-quarter of a cent a pound, and on the yellow oleomargarine was first 2 cents and was then by the act in question increased to 10 cents per pound. This court held that the discretion of Congress in the exercise of its constitutional powers to levy excise taxes could not be controlled or limited by the courts because the latter might deem the incidence of the tax oppressive or even destructive. It was the same principle as that applied in the Veazie Bank Case. This was that Congress, in selecting its subjects for taxation, might impose the burden where and as it would, and that a motive disclosed in its selection to discourage sale or manufacture of an article by a higher tax than on some other did not invalidate the tax. In neither of these cases did the law objected to show on its face as does the law before us the detailed specifications of a regulation of a state concern and business with a heavy exaction to promote the effecicacy of such regulation.\n The third case is that of Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. It involved the validity of an excise tax levied on the doing of business by all corporations, joint-stock companies, associations organized for profit having a capital stock represented by shares, and insurance companies, and measured the excise by the net income of the corporations. There was not in that case the slightest doubt that the tax was a tax, and a tax for revenue, but it was attacked on the ground that such a tax could be made excessive and thus used by Congress to destroy the existence \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 43]\n\u00a0\n of state corporations. To this, this court gave the same answer as in the Veazie Bank and McCray Cases. It is not so strong an authority for the government's contention as they are.\n The fourth case is United States v. Doremus, \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 214. That involved the validity of the Narcotic Drug Act ( 38 Stat. 785 [Comp. St.  6287g et seq.]), which imposed a special tax on the manufacture, importation and sale or gift of opium or cocoa leaves or their compounds or derivatives. It required every person subject to the special tax, to register with the collector of internal revenue his name and place of business and forbade him to sell except upon the written order of the person to whom the sale was made on a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The vendor was required to keep the order for two years, and the purchaser to keep a duplicate for the same time and all were to be subject to official inspection. Similar requirements were made as to sales upon prescriptions of a physician and as to the dispensing of such drugs directly to a patient by a physician. The validity of a special tax in the nature of an excise tax on the manufacture, importation, and sale of such drugs was, of course, unquestioned. The provisions for subjecting the sale and distribution of the drugs to official supervision and inspection were held to have a reasonable relation to the enforcement of the tax and were therefore held valid.\n The court said that the act could not be declared invalid just because another motive than taxation, not shown on the face of the act, might have contributed to its passage. This case does not militate against the conclusion we have reached in respect to the law now before us. The court, there, made manifest its view that the provisions of the so-called taxing act must be naturally and reasonably adapted to the collection of the tax and not solely to the achievement of some other purpose plainly within state power. \n\n[259 U.S. 20, 44]\n\u00a0\n For the reasons given, we must hold the Child Labor Tax Law invalid and the judgment of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissents. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAILEY v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 7\/8 a]), they were under its terms assessed the sum of $2,098.06; that they filed a claim for abatement of the same, which was denied, that the collector was about to make the exaction by distraining complainants' property, levying on it and selling it, that the act of Congress purporting to authorize the assessment was invalid under the Constitution of the United States, and on these grounds permanently enjoined the collector from proceeding to collect the assessment.\n An examination of the bill shows no other ground for equitable relief than as stated in the order. The bill does aver 'that these your petitioners have exhausted all legal remedies and it is necessary for them to be given \n\n[259 U.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n equitable relief in the premises'; but there are no specific facts set forth sustaining this mere legal conclusion. Section 3224, R. S. (Comp. St .  5947), provides that 'no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.' The averment that a taxing statute is unconstitutional does not take this case out of the section. There must be some extraordinary and exceptional circumstance not here averred or shown to make the provisions of the section inapplicable. Dodge v. Brady, \n240 \nU.S. 122, 126\n, 36 S. Sup.

They might have paid the amount assessed under protest and then brought suit against the collector to recover the amount paid with interest.

CO. v. SETTLE(1922)\nNo. 83\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 166, 167]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. Hoadley, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Harry C. Barnes, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad has freight stations at Oakley and at Madisonville, both within the city limits of Cincinnati. It duly published, in connection with other carriers, interstate carload rates on lumber from Southern points to Oakley and to Madisonville. It also duly published intrastate carload rates from Oakley to Madisonville. The interstate rates to Madisonville were higher than the interstate rates to Oakley plus the local rate from Oakley to Madisonville. W. H. Settle & Co., who are lumber dealers, with a place of business at Madisonville, had lumber shipped from the South to Oakley, paid the freight to that point, received at that station delivery of the loaded cars on the team tracks or in the bulk yard, and, without unloading any of the cars, reshipped them within a few days to Madisonville on local bills of lading, paying the local freight rate. Thus the shippers secured transportation of the lumber to Madisonville by paying less in freight charges than would have been payable according to the interstate tariff, if the cars had been billed through to Madisonville. At the time these cars were shipped from points of origin, and continuously thereafter, it had been the intention of the shippers that the cars should go to Madisonville. They were billed to Oakley, and physical possession was \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 168]\n\u00a0\n taken by the shipper there, in order to get the benefit of the lower freight charges resulting from the combination of rates. The railroad insisted that, in view of this fact, the through rate to Madisonville applied, and it brought an action against the shippers, in the federal District Court for Southern Ohio, Western Division, to recover the difference between the amounts actually received and the through rate to Madisonville. A demurrer to the petition, which set up the above facts, was overruled by the trial court, judgment entered thereon was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the case was remanded to the District Court. Settle v. Baltimore & O. S. W. R. Co., 249 Fed. 913, 162 C. C. A. 111. The railroad then discontinued that suit and brought this one in the same court. The action was tried before a jury, the facts above stated were shown, the shippers got the verdict, and judgment entered for them was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 272 Fed. 675. The case is here on writ of error.\n It is admitted that, if the reshipment from Oakley to Madisonville was part of a through interstate movement, the railroad was entitled to recover. The question is presented whether, in view of the undisputed facts, the original and continuing intention so to reship made the reshipment, as matter of law, part of a through interstate movement. The following instruction, given and excepted to, shows sufficiently how the question arose:\n'As a matter of law, the existence of an original and continuing intention in the minds of the defendants Settle and Clephane to reship this lumber from Oakley to Madisonville, for the purpose of saving expense, is not, of itself, sufficient to convert the shipments into through shipments, if there was otherwise a good faith delivery at Oakley. ... If there was a good faith delivery of this lumber at Oakley to Settle and Clephane, the fact they always had an intention in their mind, and persevered in that intention, of reshipping it to Madisonville \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 169]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of saving money on freight, that would not necessarily constitute a through shipment in interstate commerce.'\n\n No material fact, evidential or ultimate, had been left in dispute. There was no room for any issue of good faith to be determined by the jury. Physical delivery of the cars to the shippers had been made at Oakley, after payment of the freight and other charges. The shippers had no place of business at Oakley. The delivery there was the completion of one stage in the contemplated movement to Madisonville. After a brief interval the second stage was begun under the local bill of lading. It was conceivable that the shippers might find a customer who would take the lumber at Oakley, and in that event the rail movement would have ended there. But that was not probable or expected, nor was it the reason for shipping to Oakley. The movement had been divided by the shippers into two stages- instead of using through billing-because they believed that by so doing they could secure transportation to Madisonville at less than the through interstate rate. Whether under the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) lower intermediate rates can be so used in combination is the precise question for decision.\n The contention of the shippers is that the character of a movement, as intrastate or interstate, and hence what the applicable rate is, depends solely upon the contract of transportation entered into between shipper and carrier at the point of origin of the traffic; that when an interstate shipment reaches the destination named in this contract, and after payment of charges delivery is taken there by the consignee, the contract for interstate transportation is ended; that any subsequent movement of the commodity is, of necessity, under a new contract with the carrier, and at the published rate; and that, since this lumber came to rest at Oakley before that new movement, the reshipment from there to Madisonville (both \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 170]\n\u00a0\n stations being within the state of Ohio) was an intrastate movement. This contention gives to the transportation contract an effect greater than is consistent with the purposes of the Act to Regulate Commerce. The rights of shipper against carrier are determined by law through the provisions of the tariff which are embodied in the applicable published rate. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 U.S. 173\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 556; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Steve Bros. & Co., \n256 U.S. 566\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 584. And whether the interstate or the intrastate tariff is applicable depends upon the essential character of the movement. That the contract between shipper and carrier does not necessarily determine the character was settled by a series of cases in which the subject received much consideration. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 498\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 279; Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 653; Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 U.S. 111\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 229; Railroad Commission of Louisiana v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n229 U.S. 336\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 837. And in Baer Bros. Mercantile Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co ., \n233 \nU.S. 479, 490\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 641, this court held that a carrier cannot, by separating the rate into its component parts, charging local rates, and issuing local waybills, convert an interstate shipment into intrastate transportation, and thereby deprive a shipper of the benefit of an appropriate rate for a through interstate movement.\n If the intention with which the shipment was made had been actually in issue, the fact that possession of the cars was taken by the shipper at Oakley, and that they were not rebilled for several days, would have justified the jury in finding that it was originally the intention to end the movement at Oakley, and that the rebilling to Madisonville was an afterthought. But the defendant Clephane admitted at the trial that it was intended from the beginning that the cars should go to Madisonville, \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 171]\n\u00a0\n and this fact was assumed in the instructions complained of. In other words, Madisonville was at all times the destination of the cars, Oakley was to be merely an intermediate stopping place, and the original intention persisted in was carried out. That the interstate journey might end at Oakley was never more than a possibility. Under these circumstances, the intention as it was carried out determined, as matter of law, the essential nature of the movement, and hence that the movement through to Madisonville was an interstate shipment; for neither through billing, uninterrupted movement, continuous possession by the carrier, nor unbroken rulk is an essential of a through interstate shipment. These are common incidents of a through shipment, and when the intention with which a shipment was made is in issue, the presence, or absence, of one or all of these incidents may be important evidence bearing upon that question. But where it is admitted that the shipment made to the ultimate destination had at all times been intended, these incidents are without legal significance as bearing on the character of the traffic. For instance, in many cases involving transit or reconsignment privileges in blanket territory, most or all of these incidents are absent, and yet the through interstate tariffs apply. See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Harold, \n241 U.S. 371\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 665; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 49; Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey v. United States, \n257 U.S. 247\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 80. Compare Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. Hancock, \n253 U.S. 284\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 512.\n Through rates are ordinarily made lower than the sum of the intermediate rates. This practice is justified, in part, on the ground that operating costs of a through movement are less than the agregate costs of the two independent movements covering the same route. But there may be traffic or commercial conditions which compel, or justify, giving exceptionally low rates to movements \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 172]\n\u00a0\n which are intermediate. The mere existence of such intermediate rates confers no right upon the shipper to use them in combination to defeat the applicable through rate. Here there had been published interstate rates for the transportation from the Southern points to Madisonville. For such transportation the interstate rates to Madisonville were the only lawful rates. To permit the applicable through interstate rate to be defeated by use of a combination of intermediate rates would open wide the door to unjust discrimination, and it would unjustly deplete the revenues of the carrier. The sole question, therefore, which could arise in this case was whether the movement actually entered upon at point of origin, and persisted in, was transportation of the lumber to Madisonville.\n Before the decisions above referred to it was commonly assumed that, while a carrier, or one of its employees, might not act as a reconsigning agent for a shipper, in order to enable him to use a combination of lower intermediate rates, and thus avoid the higher charges incident to the through interstate movement, the shipper might so use the combination, provided he consigned the car to himself at the intermediate point, there paid the charges, took possession, and then reshipped the car on the local rate to its real destination. \n1\n The distinction made was without basis in reason. To permit carriers' revenues from interstate rates to be depleted by such misuse of a comination of intermediate by such misuse of a combination of intermediate with the provisions and purposes of the Act to Regulate Commerce than to permit them to be used as a means of discrimination. And, since the decisions cited \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 173]\n\u00a0\n above were rendered, the principle there declared has been steadfastly applied by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the purpose of protecting revenues of railroads against such attacks. \n2\n See, also, McFadden v. Alabama Great Southern R. R. Co., 241 Fed. 562, 154 C. C. A. 338. The decision in Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n204 U.S. 403\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 360, relied upon by defendants in error, is entirely consistent with these later decisions of this court, although some expressions in the opinion are not.\n The mere fact that cars received on interstate movement are reshipped by the consignee, after a brief interval, to another point, does not, of course, establish an essential continuity of movement to the latter point. The reshipment, although immediate, may be an independent intrastate movement. The instances are many where a local shipment follows quickly upon an interstate shipment and yet is not to be deemed part of it, even though some further shipment was contemplated when the original movement began. Shipments to and from distributing points often present this situation, if the applicable tariffs do not confer reconsignment or transit privileges. \n3\n The distinction is clear between cases of that character and the one at bar, where the essential nature of \n\n[260 U.S. 166, 174]\n\u00a0\n the traffic as a through movement to the point of ultimate destination is shown by the original and persisting intention of the shippers which was carried out.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See D.

PEOPLE OF PORTO RICO(1922)\nNo. 178\nArgued: March 20, 1922Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jackson H. Ralston, of Washington, D. C. for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Grant T. Trent, of Washington, D. C., for the People of Porto Rico.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two prosecutions for criminal libel, brought against the same defendant, Jesus M. Balzac, on informations filed in the district court for Arecibo, Porto Rico, by the district attorney for that district. Balzac was the editor of a daily paper published in Arecibo, known as 'El Baluarte,' and the articles upon which the charges of libel were based were published on April 16 and April 23, 1918, respectively. In each case the defendant demanded a jury. The Code of Criminal Procedure of Porto Rico grants a jury trial in cases of felony, but not in misdemeanors. The defendant, nevertheless, contended that he was entitled to a jury in such a case, under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, and that the language of the alleged libels was only fair comment, and their publication was protected by the First Amendment. His contentions were overruled; he was tried by the court, and was convicted in both cases and sentenced to five months' imprisonment in the district jail in the first, and to four months in the second, and to the payment of the costs in each. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Porto Rico. That court affirmed both judgments. People v. Balzac, 28 P. R. R. 139; second case, 28 P. R. R. 141.\n The first question in these cases is one of jurisdiction of this court. By section 244 of the Judicial Code, approved March 3, 1911 (36 Stat. 1157), it was provided that writs of error and appeals from the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico might be prosecuted to this court in any case in which was drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or authority exercised under, the United States or wherein the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress was brought in question and the right claimed thereunder was denied, and this without regard to the \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n amount involved. By the Act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 803), section 244 of the Judicial Code was repealed, but section 246 (Comp. St.  1223) was amended and made to apply to the appellate jurisdiction of this court in respect to the decisions of the Supreme Court, not only of Hawaii, as before, but also Porto Rico, and it was provided that writs of error to those courts from this court could be prosecuted in the same class of cases as those in which this court was authorized under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214) to review decisions of state courts of last resort. Section 237 at that time allowed a writ of error to final decisions in state courts of last resort where was drawn in question the validity of a treaty, or a statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States and the decision was against its validity, or where was drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States and the decision was in favor of its validity, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity was claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision was against the title, right, privilege or immunity especially set up or claimed by either party under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission or authority. By Act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 803, 804, amending section 246), this court was given power by certiorari to bring up for review all final judgments or decrees in civil or criminal cases in the supreme courts of Porto Rico and Hawaii, other than those reviewable here by writ of error because in the class similar to that described in section 237 of the Judicial Code. By Act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726), the jurisdiction of this court to review by writ of error, under section 237, final judgments and decrees of state courts of last resort was cut down by omitting cases (other than those involving the validity of \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n a treaty, statute or authority exercised under the United States or any state) wherein a title, right, privilege, or immunity, was claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision was against such title, right, privilege or immunity, and such cases, it was provided, could only be examined on review in this court by certiorari.\n The question now presented is whether the amendment to section 237 of the Judicial Code by the Act of 1916 applies to, and affects, the appellate jurisdiction of this court in reviewing decisions of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico. We think it does. We think that the manifest purpose of the Act of 1915, amending section 246 of the Code, in its reference to section 237 of the Judicial Code was to assimilate the appellate jurisdiction of this Court over the Supreme Courts of Porto Rico and Hawaii to that over state courts of last resort, and that the reference in amended section 246, to section 237 may be fairly construed to embrace subsequent changes in section 237 that are not obviously inapplicable.\n This brings us to the question whether there was drawn in question in these cases the validity of a statute of Porto Rico under the Constitution of the United States. The Penal Code of Porto Rico divides crimes into felonies and misdemeanors. Rev. Stat. and Codes of Porto Rico 1911, Penal Code,  13. A felony is described as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the penitentiary. Every other crime is declared to be a misdemeanor. Penal Code,  14. Section 178 of the Porto Rican Code of Criminal Procedure provided that issues of fact in cases of felony should be tried by a jury when the defendant so elected, but gave no such right in the case of misdemeanors. This was construed by the Supreme Court to deny such right. People v. Bird, 5 P. R. R. 387.\n By section 244 (5676) of the Penal Code (as amended by Act of March 9, 1911, p. 71), the publication of a libel is made \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment in jail for a term not exceeding two years, or both such fine and imprisonment, and also the costs of the action in the discretion of the court. It is, therefore, plain that libel under the Porto Rican law is a misdemeanor, and a jury trial was not required therein. By the Act of July 22, 1919 (Laws of Porto Rico 1919, No. 84, p. 684), a jury trial is now given in misdemeanors, but that did not come into force until after these libels were published and these trials had.\n When the Penal Code, and the Code of Criminal Procedure were first passed in 1901, they both contained the provision that in all cases of libel the jury should determine the law and the fact. It was held, however, by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico in People v. Bird, 5 P. R. R. 387, 405, that this did not give a jury trial, but only made provision that if and when a right of jury trial was given in such cases, the jury should have the power to determine the law and the fact. Thereafter the Act of March 10, 1904 (Laws of Porto Rico 1904, p. 130), expressly repealed all reference to trials for libel in the Jury Act.\n The effect of the Penal Code of Procedure, as construed by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, and of the Act of March 10, 1904, repealing the jury act as to libel cases, was a statutory denial of the right of jury trial in such cases. A demand for a jury trial in this case, therefore, drew in question the validity of the statutes upon which the court relied in denying the demand. This necessarily leads to the conclusion that these cases are in the same class as those which come to this court by writ of error under section 237, as amended by the Act of 1916, and that jurisdiction by writ of error exists.\n Was the issue properly saved in the record by the defendant? We think it was. The demand for a jury trial, the statute to the contrary notwithstanding, was made at the trial. It was renewed in the assignments of error in \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n the Porto Rican Supreme Court and here. Those assignments did not mention the statutes whose validity was involved, but merely averred that the defendant had been denied his right as an American citizen under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. While this is informal, we think that it is sufficient when the record discloses the real nature of the controversy and the specification of the assignment leaves no doubt that it is directed to that controversy.\n We have now to inquire whether that part of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, applies to Porto Rico. Another provision on the subject is in article 3 of the Constitution providing that the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed. The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution provides that in suits at common law, when the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. It is well settled that these provisions for jury trial in criminal and civil cases apply to the Territories of the United States. Webster v. Reid, 11 How. 437, 460; Reynolds v. United States, \n98 U.S. 145\n, 167; Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 556\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1301; American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, \n166 U.S. 464\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 618; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 347\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 620; Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 580; Black v. Jackson, \n177 U.S. 349\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 648; Rasmussen v.

But it is just as clearly settled that they do not apply to territory belonging to the \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n United States which has not been incorporated into the Union. Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 787; Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138, 145\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 808, 1 Ann. Cas. 697. It was further settled in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 770, and confirmed by Dorr v. United States, \n195 U.S. 138\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 808, 1 Ann. Cas. 697, that neither the Philippines nor Porto Rico was territory which had been incorporated in the Union or become a part of the United States, as distinguished from merely belonging to it; and that the acts giving temporary governments to the Philippines, 32 Stat. 691 (Comp. St.  3804 et seq.), and to Porto Rico, 31 Stat. 77 (Comp. St.  3748 et seq.), had no such effect. The Insular Cases revealed much diversity of opinion in this Court as to the constitutional status of the territory acquired by the Treaty of Paris ending the Spanish War, but the Dorr Case shows that the opinion of Mr. Justice White of the majority, in Downes v. Bidwell, has become the settled law of the court. The conclusion of this court in the Dorr Case, \n195 U.S. 149\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 813, 1 Ann. Cas. 697, was as follows:\n'We conclude that the power to govern territory, implied in the right to acquire it, and given to Congress in the Constitution in article 4 ,  3, to whatever other limitations it may be subject, the extent of which must be decided as questions arise, does not require that body to enact for ceded territory, not made part of the United States by congressional action, a system of laws which shall include the right of trial by jury, and that the Constitution does not, without legislation and of its own force, carry such right to territory so situated.'\n\n The question before us, therefore, is: Has Congress, since the Foraker Act of April 12, 1900 (31 Stat. 77), enacted legislation incorporating Porto Rico into the Union? Counsel for the plaintiff in error give, in their brief, an extended list of acts, to which we shall refer later, which they urge as indicating a purpose to make the island a part of the United States, but they chiefly rely on the Organic Act of Porto Rico of March 2, 1917 (38 Stat. 951 [Comp. St.  3803a-3803z]), known as the Jones Act. \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n The act is entitled 'An act to provide a civil government for Porto Rico and for other purposes.' It does not indicate by its title that it has a purpose to incorporate the island into the Union. It does not contain any clause which declares such purpose or effect. While this is not conclusive, it strongly tends to show that Congress did not have such an intention. Few questions have been the subject of such discussion and dispute in our country as the status of our territory acquired from Spain in 1899. The division between the political parties in respect to it, the diversity of the views of the members of this court in regard to tis constitutional aspects, and the constant recurrence of the subject in the Houses of Congress, fixed the attention of all on the future relation of this acquired territory to the United States. Had Congress intended to take the important step of changing the treaty status of Porto Rico by incorporating it into the Union, it is reasonable to suppose that it would have done so by the plain declaration, and would not have left it to mere inference. Before the question became acute at the close of the Spanish War, the distinction between acquisition and incorporation was not regarded as important, or at least it was not fully understood and had not aroused great controversy. Before that, the purpose of Congress might well be a matter of mere inference from various legislative acts; but in these latter days, incorporation is not to be assumed without express declaration, or an implication so strong as to exclude any other view.\n Again, the second section of the act is called a 'Bill of Rights,' and included therein is substantially every one of the guaranties of the federal Constitution, except those relating to indictment by a grand jury in the case of infamous crimes and the right of trial by jury in civil and criminal cases. If it was intended to incorporate Porto Rico into the Union by this act, which would ex proprio vigore make applicable the whole Bill of Rights \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution to the island, why was it thought necessary to create for it a Bill of Rights and carefully exclude trial by jury? In the very forefront of the act is this substitute for incorporation and application of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. This seems to us a conclusive argument against the contention of counsel for the plaintiff in error.\n The section of the Jones Act which counsel press on us is section 5. This in effect declares that all persons who under the Foraker Act were made citizens of Porto Rico and certain other residents shall become citizens of the United States, unless they prefer not to become such, in which case they are to declare such preference within six months, and thereafter they lose certain political rights under the new government. In the same section the United States District Court is given power separately to naturalize individuals of some other classes of residents. We set out the section in full in the margin. \n1\n Unaffected by the considerations \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 308]\n\u00a0\n already suggested, perhaps the declration of section 5 would furnish ground for an inference such as counsel for plaintiff in error contend, but under the circumstances we find it entirely consistent with nonincorporation. When Porto Ricans passed from under the government of Spain, they lost the protection of that government as subjects of the king of Spain, a title by which they had been known for centuries. They had a right to expect, in passing under the dominion of the United States, a status entitling them to the protection of their new sovereign. In theory and in law, they had it as citizens of Porto Rico, but it was an anomalous status, or seemed to be so in view of the fact that those who owed and rendered allegiance to the other great world powers were given the same designation and status as those living in their respective home countries so far as protection against foreign injustice went. It became a yearning of the Porto Ricans to be American citizens, therefore, and this act gave them the boon. What additional rights did it give them? It enabled them to move into the continental United States and becoming residents of any State there to enjoy every right of any other citizen of the United States, civil, social and political. A citizen of the Philippines must be naturalized before he can settle and vote in this country. Act of June 29, 1906,  30, 34 Stat. 606 (Comp. St.  4366). Not so the Porto Rican under the Organic Act of 1917. \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 309]\n\u00a0\n In Porto Rico, however, the Porto Rican can not insist upon the right of trial by jury, except as his own representatives in his legislature shall confer it on him. The citizen of the United states living in Porto Rico cannot there enjoy a right of trial by jury under the federal Constitution, any more than thePorto Rican. It is locality that is determinative of the application of the Constitution, in such matters as judicial procedure, and not the status of the people who live in it.\n It is true that in the absence of other and countervailing evidence, a law of Congress or a provision in a treaty acquiring territory, declaring an intention to confer political and civil rights on the inhabitants of the new lands as American citizens, may be properly interpreted to mean an incorporation of it into the Union, as in the case of Louisiana and Alaska. This was one of the chief grounds upon which this court placed its conclusion that Alaska had been incorporated in the Union, in Rasmussen v. United States, \n197 U.S. 516\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 514. But Alaska was a very different case from that of Porto Rico. It was an enormous territory, very sparsely settled, and offering opportunity for immigration and settlement by American citizens. It was on the American continent and within easy reach of the then United States. It involved none of the difficulties which incorporation of the Philippines and Porto Rico presents, and one of them is in the very matter of trial by jury. This court refers to the difficulties in Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138, 148\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 808, 812 (49 L. Ed. 128, 1 Ann. Cas. 697):\n'If the right to trial by jury were a fundamental right which goes wherever the jurisdiction of the United States extends, or if Congress, in framing laws for outlying territory, ... was obliged to establish that system by affirmative legislation, it would follow that, no matter what the needs or capacities of the people, trial by jury, and in no other way, must be forthwith established, although the result may be to work injustice \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 310]\n\u00a0\n and provoke disturbance rather than to aid the orderly administration of justice. ... Again, if the United States shall acquire by treaty the cession of territory having an established system of jurisprudence, where jury trials are unknown, but a method of fair and orderly trial prevails under an acceptable and long-established code, the preference of the people must be disregarded, their established customs ignored, and they themselves coerced to accept, in advance of incorporation into the United States, a system of trial unknown to them and unsuited to their needs. We do not think it was intended, in giving power to Congress to make regulations for the territories, to hamper its exercise with this condition.'\n\n The jury system needs citizens trained to the exercise of the reponsibilities of jurors. In common-law countries centuries of tradition have prepared a conception of the impartial attitude jurors must assume. The jury system postulates a conscious duty of participation in the machinery of justice which it is hard for people not brought up in fundamentally popular government at once to acquire. One of its greatest benefits is in the security it gives the people that they, as jurors, actual or possible, being part of the judicial system of the country, can prevent its arbitrary use or abuse. Congress has thought that a people like the Filipinos, or the Porto Ricans, trained to a complete judicial system which knows no juries, living in compact and ancient communities, with definitely formed customs and political conceptions, should be permitted themselves to determine how far they wish to adopt this institution of Anglo-Saxon origin, and when. Hence the care with which, from the time when Mr. McKinley wrote his historic letter to Mr. Root in April of 1900 (Public Laws Philippine Commission, 6-9-Act of July 2, 1902, 691, 692), concerning the character of government to be set up for the Philippines by the Phillippine Commission, until the Act \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 311]\n\u00a0\n of 1917, giving a new Organic Act to Porto Rico, the United States has been liberal in granting to the islands acquired by the Treaty of Paris most of the American constitutional guaranties, but has been sedulous to avoid forcing a jury system on a Spanish and civillaw country until it desired it. We cannot find any intention to depart from this policy in making Porto Ricans American citizens, explained as this is by the desire to put them as individuals on an exact equality with citizens from the American homeland, to secure them more certain protection against the world, and to give them an opportunity, should they desire, to move into the United States proper, and there without naturalization to enjoy all political and other rights.\n We need not dwell on another consideration which requires us not lightly to infer, from acts thus easily explained on other grounds, an intention to incorporate in the Union these distant ocean communities of a different origin and language from those of our continental people. Incorporation has always been a step, and an important one, leading to statehood. Without, in the slightest degree, intimating an opinion as to the wisdom of such a policy, for that is not our province, it is reasonable to assume that, when such a step is taken, it will be begun and taken by Congress deliberately, and with a clear declaration of purpose, and not left a matter of mere inference or construction.\n Counsel for the plaintiff in error also rely on the organization of a United States District Court in Porto Rico, on the allowance of review of the Porto Rican Supreme Court in cases when the Constitution of the United States is involved, on the statutory permission that Porto Rican youth can attend West Point and Annapolis Academies, on the authorized sale of United States stamps in the island, on the extension of revenue, navigation, immigration, \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 312]\n\u00a0\n national banking, bankruptcy, federal employers' liability, safety appliance, extradition, and census laws in one way or another to Porto Rico. With the background of the considerations already stated, none of these, nor all of them put together, furnish ground for the conclusion pressed on us.\n The United States District Court is not a true United States court established under article 3 of the Constitution to administer the judicial power of the United States therein conveyed. It is created by virtue of the sovereign congressional faculty, granted under article 4,  3, of that instrument, of making all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The resemblance of its jurisdiction to that of true United States courts, in offering an opportunity to nonresidents of resorting to a tribunal not subject to local influence, does not change its character as a mere territorial court. Nor does the legislative recognition that federal constitutional questions may arise in litigation in Porto Rico have any weight in this discussion. The Constitution of the United States is in force in Porto Rico as it is wherever and whenever the sovereign power of that government is exerted. This has not only been admitted, but emphasized, by this court in all its authoritative expressions upon the issues arising in the Insular Cases, especially in the Downes v. Bidwell and the Door Cases. The Constitution, however, contains grants of power, and limitations which in the nature of things are not always and everywhere applicable and the real issue in the Insular Cases was not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or Porto Rico when we went there, but which ones of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements. The guaranties of certain fundamental personal rights declared in the Constitution, as, for instance, \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 313]\n\u00a0\n that no person could be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, had from the beginning full application in the Philippines and Porto Rico, and, as this guaranty is one of the must fruitful in causing litigation in our own country, provision was naturally made for similar controversy in Porto Rico. Indeed, provision is made for the consideration of constitutional questions coming on appeal and writs of error from the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which are certainly not incorporated in the Union. Judicial Code,  248 (Comp. St. 1225a).\n On the whole, therefore, we find no features in the Organic Act of Porto Rico of 1917 from which we can infer the purpose of Congress to incorporate Porto Rico into the United States with the consequences which would follow.\n This court has passed on substantially the same questions presented here in two cases, People of Porto Rico v. Tapia, \n245 U.S. 639\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 192, and People v. Muratti, \n245 U.S. 639\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 192. In the former, the question was whether one who was charged with committing a felonious homicide some 12 days after the passage of the Organic Act in 1917, could be brought to trial without an indictment of a grand jury as required by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The United States District Court of Porto Rico, on a writ of habeas corpus, held that he could not be held to answer and discharged him. In the other case, the felony charged was alleged to have been committed before the passage of the Organic Act, but prosecution was begun afterwards. In that, the Supreme Court of Porto Rico held that an indictment was not rendered necessary by the Organic Act. This court reversed the District Court in the Tapia Case and affirmed the Supreme Court in the Muratti Case, necessarily holding the Organic Act had not incorporated Porto Rico into the United States. These cases were disposed of by a per curiam. Counsel have urged us in the cases \n\n[258 U.S. 298, 314]\n\u00a0\n at the bar to deal with the questions raised more at length in exposition of the effect of the Organic Act of 1917 upon the issue, and we have done so.\n A second assignment of error is based on the claim that the alleged libels here did not pass the bounds of legitimate comment on the conduct of the Governor of the island, against whom they were directed, and that its prosecution is a violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, securing free speech and a free press. A reading of the two articles removes the slightest doubt that they go far beyond the 'exuberant expressions of meridional speech,' to use the expression of this court in a similar case in Gandia v. Pittingill, \n222 \nU.S. 452, 458\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 127. Indeed, they are so excessive and outrageous in their character that they suggest the query whether their superlative vilification has not overleaped itself and become unconsciously humorous. But this is not a defense.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico are\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr, Justice HOLMES concurs in the resuit. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 5.

FIRST NAT BANK OF ROME, GA(1922)\nNo. 73\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n (Nos. 73, 74): \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm.

Clark, both of Jacksonville, Fla., for respondents.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were argued and submitted together. They involve the same questions of law, and the essential facts are the same in each. Reference will therefore be made only to No. 76.\n The First National Bank of Rome, Ga., indorsee of five certificates of deposit made by the Bank of Jasper, a Florida corporation, sued the maker at law in the federal court for the Southern district of that state. The defendant pleaded in bar seven decrees of the circuit court for Hamilton county, Fla., entered in suits in which the Georgia bank had been named as one of the respondents. The plaintiff replied that the suits in which these decrees were entered were in personam; that it was and is a nonresident of Florida, had not been found within the state, and had not appeared in those suits except specially to move to quash the pretended constructive service upon it by publication; and that the decrees are as to it of no legal effect. The District Court sustained the plea of res judicata and entered judgment for defendant. The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. See First National Bank of Rome, Ga., v. First National Bank of Jasper, Fla., 264 Fed. 83. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n254 U.S. 622\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 7. Whether on the facts hereinafter set forth the state court acquired jurisdiction and the legal effect of the decrees are the matters presented for our consideration.\n The Rome Insurance Company of Georgia wished to raise capital by selling shares of its stock. To aid it in so doing the American Bank & Trust Company, also of Rome, was appointed agent or trustee. These two companies selected Jasper, Fla., as the field of operations for the stock- selling campaign; and they secured the Bank of Jasper as an ally. Then, to facilitate sales, the \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n three devised the following plan: Purchasers of the stock were enabled to discount at the Jasper bank their one-year notes for an amount equal to the purchase price, giving the stock as collateral; and the American Company, as trustee for the insurance company, agreed to deposit with the Jasper bank an amount equal to each discount, taking that bank's negotiable certificate of deposit in the usual form, payable in one year, with interest at 4 per cent. Thus the stock purchased was paid for; the Jasper bank made discounts and received deposits; the insurance company raised capital and had it paid up-all without anybody parting with a cent in cash. Under this arrangement many citizens of Jasper bought stock in the insurance company. In time their notes, and likewise the corresponding certificates of deposit, matured. The purchasers of the stock discovered that it was worthless, and that they had been defrauded; the Bank of Jasper that it also had been defrauded, and that its certificates of deposit had been transferred to the First National Bank of Rome. There was default on the certificates of deposit; and the First National Bank brought this action against the Bank of Jasper in the federal District Court. But a few days before it did so each purchaser of stock had filed a bill in equity in the state Circuit Court against the Jasper bank and the three Rome corporations. It is the final decrees entered in these suits 18 months later which are pleaded in bar of this action on the certificates of deposit.\n Each bill recited, in substance, the above facts and alleged that the note given by the complainant was in the hands of the Jasper bank; that the proceeds (of the discount) were deposited with it; that the certificate of deposit issued to the American Company covers such proceeds; and that they have ever since remained in the bank. The bill prayed that these proceeds be impressed with a trust in favor of the complainant; that the First National \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n Bank of Rome be declared not to have any interest therein; that the certificate of deposit, the note, and the contract to purchase the stock be declared void; that the American Company, the insurance company, and the Jasper bank be restrained from bringing suit against the complainant; that the Jasper bank be restrained from making any payment to the First National Bank out of the proceeds of complainant's note; and that the latter bank be restrained from withdrawing any part of such proceeds.\n None of the three Rome corporations was domiciled or found in the state of Florida. Constructive service by publication in a newspaper was made under the Florida law. General Statutes,  1866. Then the three corporations entered their 'appearance specially, solely and only for the purpose' of moving to quash the service. The motion was overruled. The defendants were given time to plead, but did not do so, and again, appearing 'specially, solely, and only' for that purpose, entered their appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida from the order overruling the motion to quash the pretended service by publication, and, also appearing 'specially, solely, and only' for that purpose, they applied to the Circuit Court for an order fixing the terms of the supersedeas on the appeal. That the notice of this application given counsel for complainant 'shall in no sense operate as a general appearance' was stipulated by them; and thereupon, the order of supersedeas was made and the required bond given. It was suggested in the Supreme Court that the appeal operated as a general appearance, and therefore rendered the question submitted moot; but the court did not pass upon this objection. It declared that 'the purpose of the statute authorizing constructive service by publication [is] to notify residents of the pending suit [in equity] so that they may, if they care to do so, come into the case, and, if the statute be followed, there is no right in the nonresident to quash this notice; he has \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n his right, if not waived, to object should the court thereafter commit an error against him'; and it affirmed the order of the lower court. Rome Insurance Co. et al. v. Corbett, 66 Fla. 438, 63 South. 833.\n The three Rome corporations took no further part in the suits in the state courts. But in the Circuit Court a decree pro confesso was entered as against all the respondents, which declared that the sale and purchase of the stock was void; that the proceeds of the complainant's note 'included in said certificate of deposit No. 319 now held by the First National Bank of Rome are hereby decreed to be impressed with a trust in favor of the complainant and the same are adjudged to belong to him'; that the Bank of Jasper be enjoined from paying any part of these proceeds to the First National Bank; and that the certificate of deposit, 'in so far as it covers and includes the proceeds derived from the said note,' was void. The Bank of Jasper insists that these decrees are res judicata of its alleged liability to the First National Bank on the certificates of deposit: First, because they are valid judgments in personam against the latter bank; and, secondly, because the certificates of deposit represent the proceeds of the notes, and these proceeds were a res within the jurisdiction of the court, and there was thus jurisdiction in rem to adjudicate the alleged liability on the certificates of deposit.\n The contention that the decrees constitute personal judgments against the First National Bank rests upon the assertion that under the law of Florida an appeal operates necessarily as a general appearance, although the appeal is taken solely from an interlocutory order asserting jurisdiction, and although in taking it the appellant declares in terms that his appearance is special, and solely for the purpose of the appeal. It may be assumed that, if such were the settled law of Florida, it would be accepted by this Court as controlling. York v. Texas, \n137 U.S. 15\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 9. But our attention has not been called to any Florida \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n statute or rule of court or decision which so declares. There is confessedly no statute or rule of court to that effect; and none of the cases relied upon support the proposition that such is the common law of Florida. This contention seems to have been made in the equity suits here under consideration; but the Supreme Court did not there pass upon the question. Rome Insurance Co. et al. v. Corbett, supra, 66 Fla. 439, 63 South. 833. It is clear that in Florida an appearance entered in the trial court specially for the purpose of moving to quash a summons does not operate as a general appearance (Standley v. Arnow, 13 Fla. 361, 368), but that if, after such a motion is made and overruled, the cause proceeds to final decree, a defendant who prosecutes an appeal therefrom will be held to have appeared generally. The appeal here in question was not from a final decree. It was from an interlocutory order overruling the objection to the jurisdiction. The right to review an interlocutory order by a separate appeal is conferred broadly by section 1908 of the General Statutes of Florida; and there is nothing to indicate that the right does not extend to orders concerning jurisdiction. It certainly may not be assumed that the Legislature intended that exercise of the right conferred should operate as a general appearance, and thus render moot a consideration of the ruling alone sought to be reviewed. Moreover, in none of the cases from the Supreme Court of Florida relied upon was it shown that the appearance on appeal was in terms special and limited to the review of the question of jurisdiction. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The contention that the proceeds of the discounts of the notes constitute a res within the state, of which \n\n[258 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n the certificates of deposit were merely evidence, rests upon a misapprehension. No specific fund was ever set apart by the Jasper bank. Its discounts resulted in general credits by the bank to the makers of the notes. These credits were applied in making payment for their stock. The payment was made by transferring to the credit of the American Company the amount which stood to the credit of the makers of the notes. The credits- called deposits-so transferred became an indebtedness of the Jasper bank to the American Company. That indebtedness, if it had rested in open account, would have been property of the creditor within the state of Florida. In an appropriate proceeding it might have been reached to satisfy a claim against its owner. Pennington v. Fourth National Bank, \n243 U.S. 269\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 282, L. R. A. 1917F, 1159. But the suits in the state court were not proceedings of that character. In them the complainant asserted that, be reason of the fraud alleged, the Jasper bank was indebted not to any of its corespondents, but to the complainant. Moreover, there was no indebtedness on open account to any of the Georgia corporations; for this account had been closed by giving certificates of deposit; and these had been transferred to the First National Bank. Such certificates are merely promissory notes of the Jasper bank, payable, like unsecured notes of individuals, out of general assets. Like other notes, they are negotiable, and are payable only upon surrender of the instrument properly indorsed. There is not even an allegation either that the transfer to the First National Bank had been made after maturity of the certificates or that the indorsee took them with notice of the fraud.\n As neither the certificates of deposit nor the holder thereof were within the state of Florida, its courts could not-in the absence of consent-acquire jurisdiction to determine the liability of maker to holder.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tunno & Jessup & Co. v.

Adams, of Pueblo, Colo., and T. B. Catron, of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellant.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John H. Fry, of Denver, Colo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The waterworks company is a corporation of New Mexico and was incorporated to furnish the city of Raton with water. Its system is constituted of pipes, mains, conduits, sources of water, reservoir sites, and reservoirs. \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n (These accessories are to be understood when we use the word 'system.')\n The Bankers' Trust Company, alleging itself to be the successor of the original trustee in a deed of trust or mortgage executed by the water works company to secure an issue of bonds brings this suit: (1) To enjoin the city from enforcing an ordinance requiring the removal of the waterworks company's system from the city; (2) to enjoin the disturbance of the system and to protect the enjoyment of the waterworks company of its water rights; (3) that the city be required to pay the trust company such sum as will compensate the bondholders for the loss and injury to the trust property through the impairment and breach of the contract through which, it is alleged, the city gave exclusive rights to the water company to furnish water to the city.\n To justify the relief prayed and to establish the jurisdiction of the District Court (and we may say of the appeal to this court) the trust company alleged the value of the matter in controversy exceeds $3,000-and involves the Constitution of the Unites States because the acts of the city produced the results from which relief is prayed by violating the contract the city entered into with the waterworks company, and will deprive the trust company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The bill is very long and replete with repetitions, but, as it constitutes the case, we give a summary of it is follows:\n The town of Raton (it was then a town) having no water supply, the Raton Water Company was incorporated and constructed a system to furnish water to the town. The town grew, and its officials and citizens induced the incorporation of the Raton Waterworks Company, and selected its present source of the supply of water. The company then began and completed its water system, \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n and subsequently purchased the property and rights of the Raton Water Company.\n On or about July 20, 1891, the waterworks company and the city entered into a contract evidenced by an ordinance by which the company agreed to furnish water to the city for a period of 25 years and the city agreed that it would not operate or maintain waterworks in or near the town for the same period from July 25, 1891, and also agreed to pay a rental for fire hydrants for the same time at a rate fixed in the ordinance. The ordinance was known as Ordinance No. 10. It was ratified by a vote of the citizens of the town and accepted by the company. The company constructed a system in accordance with the contract and the act of its incorporation, and has performed its terms and conditions. And it has become the owner of valuable and extensive water rights, reservoirs, and reservoir sites.\n On February 1, 1905, the waterworks company executed and delivered to the Manhattan company, and selected its present trust conveying all of the water company's, property, rights, privileges, and franchises to secure an issue of bonds to the amount of $30,000. 'The Bankers' Trust Company has duly succeeded to all the rights, duties and obligations of the Manhattan Trust Company under and by virtue of the provisions of said deed of trust and now is the duly qualified and acting trustee under said mortgage or deed of trust.' The bonds are outstanding in the hands of holders in due course and for value, and none have been paid or otherwise canceled or satisfied.\n The city in 1912 began steps with intention to impair the contract between it and the waterworks company, and, after an election authorizing an issue of bonds for the purpose of constructing a waterworks system, proceeded, in accordance with an ordinance passed July 16, 1913, to the construction of a water works system and erected fire \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n hydrants, prior to the expiration of the company's exclusive contract, which caused the revenues and income from the latter to be impaired and reduced to the extent of over $30,000.\n The city ordered the company to remove its system, and on August 6, 1915, by an ordinance, repealed Ordinance No. 10, and revoked all the rights conferred by it, and ordered the company to immediately remove its system, and the mayor, clerk, and city attorney were directed to enforce the ordinance, which took effect five days after its passage, and repealed all other ordinances. The ordinance was known as Ordinance No. 197.\n The only source of supply for the city's system is that of the waterworks company, and the city has taken possession of a portion of the reservoirs of the company, and such taking is a deprivation of the property of the company without due process of law. Other deprivations are alleged, and that the city has occupied with some of its works, the lands of the company more than two miles from the exterior boundaries of the city. The only source of income to the company is the system and lands thus taken.\n At the time of filing the original bill there were pending two actions between the waterworks company and the city, one of which was in the United States court and the other in the state court, in each of which there were matters pertinent and material to the cause of the complainant in this action. By stipulation, this case was delayed to await the final determination of those actions, and the bill here has been amended to present the issues as they may have been changed or affected by those decisions, and the lapse of time and events since filing the original bill.\n The city moved to dismiss the bill on the ground, among others (the others will be considered later), that \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action in equity. The motion was granted. This appeal attacks that action. The grounds of the attack seem to have for their principal basis the Act of New Mexico passed February 24, 1887 (Laws 1887, c. 12), section 24 of which authorized the incorporation of water companies to supply water to towns and cities, with the power to lay mains or pipes in, along, and upon the public streets or alleys of the town or city, subject to such regulations as may be provided by the corporate authorities of the city or town, and to furnish and supply such city and town or the inhabitants thereof, with water upon such terms and conditions as may be fixed by such corporations or as may be agreed to by the consumers and such corporations.\n It is contended that the act gave a franchise unlimited in duration, subject, however, to regulation by the town or city. And it is further contended, in opposition to a contention of the city, that a prior act ( April 1, 1884 [Laws 1884, c. 39]), which gave a city the power to erect waterworks if authorized by a majority of the voters of the city, or the right to grant private individuals such power for a term not exceeding 25 years, was repealed by the Act of February 24, 1887. The contentions of the parties are therefore in sharp contrast. Appellant contends that the Water Company had a perpetual right in the city, not subject to interference by the city,1 and though not exclusive, by the contract with the city evidenced by Ordinance No. 10 it was preserved from competition by the city, and that the Act of 1887 and the ordinance constituted a contract \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 335]\n\u00a0\n with the state, that was inviolable under the Constitution of the United States, and therefore, invulnerable to Ordinance No. 197, repealing Ordinance No. 10 and ordering the company from the city.\n The opposing contention of the city is that there is no inharmony between the Act of 1884 and the Act of 1887, that they have coordinate purpose-the Act of 1887 giving a company incorporated under it the capacity to receive a grant from a city with power of regulation by the city. It is further contended the water company recognized this, and applied to the city for a grant, and that, in response to the application, the city enacted Ordinance No. 10 and exercised the power of regulation conferred by the Act of 1887 by fixing the duration of the grant at 25 years from July 25, 1891. It was accepted by the company with that limitation, and it is the contention by the application and acceptance it is estopped to deny that its right to furnish water to the city was derived from the contract with the city.\n We are not called upon to review in detail the contentions and consider their various elements. We concur in the view of the city that the waterworks company is estopped by its contract with the city, evidenced by Ordinance No. 10 (which we may remark was ratified by a vote of the citizens of the city), and we construe it as the city construes it. From what act the power to enact it was derived we need not pronounce. We may say, however, that the Supreme Court of the state in Raton Waterworks Co. v. City of Raton, 22 N. M. 464, 164 Pac. 826, said the franchise of the company was granted by an ordinance of the city, and certainly the bill in this case shows that its term was fixed at 25 years from July 25, 1891. The term, therefore, had expired when the amended bill was filed. The term of the rights having expired, necessarily the rights granted expired, and the city cannot be enjoined from requiring the removal of the company's \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 336]\n\u00a0\n system from the streets of the city. Whatever rights of property appellant may have in its reservoirs and in the land upon which they are located may be the subject of other actions if the city asserts rights to them that have not been adjudicated. Some of them, it may be all of them, have been adjudicated.\n One of the suits referred to in our summary of the bill as pending when the original bill was filed (October 27, 1915), was brought by the waterworks company against the city in the District Court from which this appeal is taken. From the opinion of the court, annexed to the city's brief, about the same questions here presented were there presented, and it was decided that the repeal of Ordinance No. 10 was justified because of the failure of the waterworks company to furnish pure and wholesome water. And it was decided that the ordinance gave the city the power of revocation, and the power was legally exercised by the enactment of Ordinance No. 197, and it should not be enjoined.\n The relief prayed by the company on account of the occupation of its reservoir sites by the city was denied because of a condemnation suit in a state court, which was proceeding, it was said, in due course. And we may observe that in the City of Raton v. Raton Ice Co., 26 N. M. 300, 191 Pac. 516, it is decided that the city has power of eminent domain, and can exercise it more than two miles from the city limits. The case passed on the condemnation of one of the reservoir sites mentioned in the bill in this case. The decision seems to be a refutation of some of the contentions of appellant. The judgment of the District Court was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and dismissed on stipulation. 232 Fed. 1020, 146 C. C. A. 665. We do not refer to the case as binding upon appellant here, but to present clearly that the principal question presented by the present bill is the right of the trust \n\n[258 U.S. 328, 337]\n\u00a0\n company under a prior trust deed covering the rights of the water company to occupy the streets of the city notwithstanding the expiration of the time given to the company by Ordinance No. 10. The time having expired, the conduct of the city prior to its expiration is not important to consider.\n The other grounds of dismissal were: (1) There was misjoinder of parties defendant in that the waterworks company, the owner of the system, should have been joined with the trust company as complainant, and that there was no allegation that it refused to join as complainant. (2) There was a misjoinder of parties defendant in that the waterworks company is made defendant when it should have been made complainant. (3) There was a misjoinder of causes of action in that the bill set forth at least three independent causes of action: (a) Action for damages; (b) action to enjoin the enforcement of Ordinance No. 197; (c) trespass by the city upon certain real property of the waterworks company. As to the latter grounds, that is, the union of independent causes of action, it is not very substantial. They are but the specifications of the elements of the right of suit; that is, the equity that appellant has. In other words, they are the enumerations of the elements of the asserted aggression upon the company and in emphasis of it. The other grounds of the motion to dismiss are untenable.

CHANDLER(1922)\nNo. 239\nArgued: October 10, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. M. Neil, Thomas H. Jackson, and James L. McRee, all of Memphis, Tenn. (Frank M. Thompson, Atty. Gen., and Nathan William MacChesney, of Chicago, Ill., of counsel), for appellants.\n Messrs. Elias Gates, Julian C. Wilson, and Walter P. Armstrong, all of Memphis, Tenn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellees, as complainants in the District Court, in their capacity as copartners or as individuals, assailed the constitutionality, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, of a statute of Tennessee passed in 1921, entitled:\n'An act to define, regulate and license real estate brokers and real estate salesmen, to create a state real estate commission, and to provide a penalty for a violation of the provisions thereof.' Laws 1921, c. 98.\n\n Appellants Bratton, Adams, and Brownlow were appointed commissioners under the act, and they and the appellant Bates, as Attorney General of Shelby County, or as district attorney (he is described as the latter in the answer) of the county, were, it is alleged, charged with the duty of enforcing the act.\n The pleadings are very elaborate and need not be reproduced. The court restrained the execution of the statute until its further order, basing its action upon the provisions of the statute, which the court decided did not afford to applicants for licenses due process of law. To review the order and the grounds of it, this appeal is directed. \n\n[260 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n The act constitutes a commission to be appointed by the Governor of the state and in 21 sections defines the powers and duties of the commission, the qualifications of applicants for licenses, and the procedure they must observe.\n The District Court (three judges sitting) gave a very studious and comprehensive consideration to the provisions of the act, but rested its decision adverse to the constitutionality of the act upon section 8. The determining pertinency of the section the court expressed by saying that 'the first step in the proposed regulation' of the real estate business 'is the granting and issuing of licenses as provided in section 8' of the act. That 'section gives color and purpose to every other section in the act and without which the other sections would be meaningless.'\n We may then accept the controlling and comprehensive effect of the section and concentrate attention and decision upon it, pretermitting all others or comment upon them.\n The condemning comment of the court was that section 8 authorized the commission, not only to require an applicant to furnisl evidence of his qualifications, but to procure independently of the applicant any proof it may deem desirable, and this without any provision for notice or opportunity to meet the evidence so procured, nor even to be advised of the nature or source of the evidence. Because of this delinquency the court was of opinion that the act did not afford due process of law, and was therefore unconstitutional and void.\n Is the comment and conclusion justified? The section requires an application for a license to be made in writing and provides, with circumstantial detail, what it shall contain and concludes as follows:\n'The commission is hereby authorized to require and procure [italics ours] any and all satisfactory proof as shall be deemed \n\n[260 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n desirable in reference to the honesty, truthfulness, reputation and competency of any applicant for a real estate broker's or salesman's license, or of any of the officers or members of any such applicant, prior to the issuance of any such license. The Commission is expressly vested with the power and authority to make, prescribe and enforce any and all such rules and regulations connected with the application for any license, as shall be deemed necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this act.'\n\n The District Court, in further comment upon the provision, expressed a doubt that any rulings or regulations that might be promulgated by the commission would cure the defect of the statute and added:\n'However, that question is not here presented, for it does not appear from the pleadings in this case that any such rulings have been promulgated though the commission is functioning in manner and form as authorized by the statute.'\n\n So determined was the court in the view it had of section 8 that it rejected the immunity which section 19 gave from the unconstitutionality which might taint any section or provision of the act from extending to other sections or provisions. 'Be it further enacted,' is the declaration of section 19, 'that should the courts declare any section or provision of this act unconstitutional, such decision shall affect only the section or provision so declared to be unconstitutional, and shall not affect any other section or part of this act.'\n The court justified its rejection of section 19 because in its (the court's) view the section had 'no application in determining the validity of the sections in which the unconstitutional provision is found.' To this conclusion the court considered itself constrained because to eliminate the offensive part of section 8 'would emasculate the entire section' and the commission would be a mere automaton without authority to determine the fundamental questions of the \n\n[260 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n right of the applicant for a licenese' because it would be confined to and be compelled to accept as conclusive the evidence presented by the applicant, which the court considered 'was not the legislative intent.' And hence the court's conclusion was that section 8 'was so closely related to the valid sections that without it they could serve no purpose within the contemplation of the Legislature,' citing Weaver v. Davidson Co ., 104 Tenn. 315, 59 S. W. 1105; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 565\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 431.\n The views of the court are stated with great force, but we are unable to yield to them-their reasoning or conclusions. By section 8, as we have said, the Commission is 'authorized to require and procure [italics ours] any and all satisfactory proof as shall be deemed desirable in reference' to the conditions and qualifications of applicants for licenses. The words are 'require and procure.' They seem to have independent and cumulative meaning, one demanding publicity, the other permitting secrecy. But to this possibility we are not disposed; we prefer the admonition of the cases and their decision as expressed in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, 659 (60 L. Ed. 161, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854) as follows:\n'A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid, not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 U.S. 366\n, 408.'\n\n In the cited case the admonition is said to express an elementary rule, and we think the statute of Tennessee attracts instead of repels the admonition. The statute is drawn with care to details and their importance, importance to the business regulated and the persons who will desire to engage in it, action under it was intended, therefore, to be open and direct, not to be remitted in any part to secrecy, prejudice, or intrigue.\n In conclusion, we may say that, if the word 'procure' is more than a tautological repetition of the word 'require,' it was only to confer the power of affirmative \n\n[260 U.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n direction upon the commission, necessary to be exercised in supplement to the action of the applicant and with the same publicity and opportunity of the applicant to meet adverse evidence. And the act construed as we construe it will take no power from the commission necessary to the performance of its duties, and will leave no power with it that it can exercise to the detriment of any right assured to an applicant for a license by the Constitution of the United States.\n The decree of the court ordering the issuance of a temporary injunction is\n Reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBREWER-ELLIOTT OIL & GAS CO. v. U.S.(1922)\nNo. 52\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. A. Ledbetter, S. P. Freeling, H. L. Stuart, and E. E. Blake, all of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit affirming that of the District Court for Western Oklahoma. The bill in equity was filed by the United States for itself and as Trustee for the Osage Tribe of Indians, against the Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Company, and five other such companies, lessees, under oil and gas leases granted by the state of Oklahoma, of portions of the bed of the Arkansas river, opposite the Osage Reservation in that state. It averred that the river bed thus leased belonged to the Osages, and not to Oklahoma, and that the leases were void, that the defendants were prospecting for, and drilling for, oil in the leased lots in the river bed and were erecting oil derricks and other structures therein, and prayed for the cancelling of the leases, the enjoining of defendants from further operations under their leases, and a quieting of the title to the premises in the United States as trustee.\n The state of Oklahoma intervened by leave of Court and in its answer denied that the Osage Tribe or the United States as its trustee owned the river bed of which these lots were a part, but averred that it was owned by the state in fee. The other defendants adopted the answer of the state.\n After a full hearing and voluminous evidence, the District Court found that at the place in question the Arkansas river was, and always had been, a nonnavigable \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n stream, that by the express grant of the government, made before Oklahoma came into the Union, the Osage Tribe of Indians took title in the river bed to the main channel and still had it. It entered a decree as prayed in the bill. The Curcuit Court of Appeals held that whether the river was navigable or nonnavigable, the United States, as the owner of the territory through which the Arkansas flowed before statehood, had the right to dispose of the river bed, and had done so, to the Osages. It also concurred in the finding of the District Court that the Arkansas at this place was, and always had been, nonnavigable, and that the United States had the right to part with the river bed to the Osage Tribe when it did so. It affirmed the decree.\n The Osage Tribe derived title to their reservation from the Act of Congress of June 5, 1872, entitled an act to confirm to the Great and Little Osage Indians a reservation in the Indian Territory (17 Stat. 228). The Act with its recitals is printed in the margin. \n1\n The de scription \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n of the tract conveyed is:\n'Bounded on the east by the ninety-sixth meridian, on the south and west by the north line of the Creek country, and the main channel of the Arkansas river, and on the north by the south line of the state of Kansas.'\n\n The Act of March 3, 1873 (17 Stat. 530, 538), directed the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer $1,650,600 from Osage funds to pay for lands purchased by the Osages from the Cherokees. The Act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. 603, 624), appropriated $300,000 to be paid to the Cherokees for this and other lands on condition of their executing a proper deed. The conveyance from the Cherokees to the United States in trust for the Osages recites the Cherokee Treaty of 1866 (14 Stat. 799), the \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n Acts of June 5, 1872, March 3, 1873, and March 3, 1883, and conveys to the United States the tract of country described in the Act of June 5, 1872, except that, instead of its being bounded by the main channel of the Arkansas river, it is described as townships and fractional townships, 'the fractional townships being on the left bank of the Arkansas river.' The deed purports to be executed under authority of an act of the Cherokee Nation, which directed a deed under the Act of March 3, 1883, requiring conveyance, satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior, to the United States in trust for the Osages now occupying said tract, 'as they occupy the same.'\n We have no doubt that the title to the river bed is to be determined by the language of the Act of June 5, 1872, \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n and that the meaning of the Cherokee deed is to be interpreted not as if its words stood alone but in the light of the acts of Congress in pursuance of which it was made, and especially of the Act of 1872, under which the Osages took possession, and which was enough to vest in them good title to the land described therein without the deed of 1883. Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 673\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 565; Jones v. Meehan, \n175 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 1; Francis v. Francis, \n203 \nU.S. 233, 237\n, 238 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 129.\n Coming then to consider the effect of the words of the Act of 1872 in bounding the Osage reservation 'by the main channel of the Arkansas river,' we are met by the argument that the United States had no power to grant the bed of the Arkansas river, a navigable stream, to the Indians, because it held title to it only in trust to convey it to the states to be formed out of the Louisiana Purchase which when admitted to the Union must, in order to be equal in power to the other states, be vested with sovereign rights over the beds of navigable waters and streams. The case of Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, is cited to sustain this proposition. That was a case where a Spanish claimant of land under navigable waters in Alabama, seeking to establish title against the state, relied on a confirmation of an invalid Spanish grant by the United States enacted after Alabama became a state. Such a confirmation was held to be ineffective against the sovereign title of the state. The language of Mr. Justice McKinley, who spoke for the court, fully sustains the argument made here that even before statehood, the United States was without power to convey title to land under navigable water and deprive future states of their future ownership. Such a view was not necessary, however, to the case before the court and has since been qualified by the court through Chief Justice Taney in Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 How. 471, 478. Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 U.S. 504\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1076, relied on by counsel for appellants, \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n does not sustain their contention. The gist of the court's holding there was that a right to hunt upon the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game might be found thereon granted by the United States in an Indian treaty made before the statehood of Wyoming was not to be construed as intended to continue thereafter or to give immunity from the Wyoming game laws.\n The whole subject has been clarified after the fullest examination of all the authorities in a most useful opinion by Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court in Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 548. On page 47 of 152 U. S., on page 565 of 14 Sup. Ct. (38 L. Ed. 331), the learned Justice says:\n'VIII. Notwithstanding the dicta contained in some of the opinions of this court, already quoted, to the effect that Congress has no power to grant any land below high-water mark of navigable waters in a territory of the United States, it is evident that this is not strictly true.'\n\n And he then reviews the cases and thus states the court's conclusion ( \n152 U.S. 48\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 566):\n'We cannot doubt, therefore, that Congress has the power to make grants of lands below high-water mark of navigable waters in any territory of the United States, whenever it becomes necessary to do so in order to perform international obligations, or to effect the improvement of such lands for the promotion and convenience of commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, or to carry out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the United States hold the territory.\n\n'IX. But Congress has never undertaken by general laws to dispose of such lands. And the reasons are not far to seek. ...\n\n'The Congress of the United States, in disposing of the public lands, has constantly acted upon the theory that those lands, whether in the interior, or on the coast, above high-water mark, may be taken up by actual occupants, in \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n order to encourage the settlement of the country; but that the navigable waters and the soils under them whether within or above the ebb and flow of the tide, shall be and remain public highway; and, being chiefly valuable for the public purposes of commerce, navigation and fishery, and for the improvements necessary to secure and promote those purposes, shall not be granted away during the period of territorial government; but, unless in case of some international duty or public exigency, shall be held by the United States in trust for future States, and shall vest in the several states, when organized and admitted into the Union, with all the powers and prerogatives appertaining to the older states in regard to such waters and soils within their respective jurisdictions; in short, shall not be disposed of piecemeal to individuals as private property, but shall be held as a whole for the purpose of being ultimately administered and dealt with for the public benefit by the state, after it shall have become a completely organized community.'\n\n We do not think the declared purpose of the Louisiana Purchase Treaty with France (8 Stat. 200) that statehood should be ultimately conferred on the inhabitants of the territory purchased, relied on by the appellants, varies at all the principles to be applied in this case. They are the same in respect to territory of the United States whether derived from the older states, Spain, France of Mexico. If the Arkansas river were navigable in fact at the locus in quo, the unrestricted power of the United States when exclusive sovereign, to part with the bed of such a stream for any purpose, asserted by the Circuit Court of Appeals would be before us for consideration. If that could not be sustained, a second question would arise whether vesting ownership of the river bed in the Osages was for 'a public purpose appropriate to the objects for which the United States hold territory,' within the language of Mr. Justice Gray in Shively v. Bowlby above quoted. \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n We do not find it necessary to decide either of these questions in view of the finding as a fact that the Arkansas is and was not navigable at the place where the river bed lots, here in controversy, are.\n A navigable river in this country is one which is used, or is susceptible of being used in its ordinary condition, as a highway for commerce over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade, and travel on water. It does not depend upon the mode by which commerce is conducted upon it, whether by steamers, sailing vessels or flat boats, nor upon the difficulties attending navigation, but upon the fact whether the river in its natural state is such that it affords a channel for useful commerce. Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 U.S. 574\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 406, decided May 1, 1922; Economy Light Co. v. United States, \n256 U.S. 113\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 409; The Montello, 20 Wall. 430; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563. Voluminous testimony was introduced in the District Court upon the issue of navigability. That court considered it all with evident care and had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the Arkansas River along the Osage Reservation was not, and had never been, navigable within the adjudged meaning of that term, and that the head of navigation is and was the mouth of the Grand river, near which was Fort Gibson, and this is a number of miles below the reservation. The Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed this finding and fully concurred in its correctness. Neither the argument nor the record discloses any ground which can overcome the weight which the findings of two courts must have with us. Washington Sec. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 725; Texas Railway Co. v. Louisiana R. R. Commission, \n232 U.S. 338\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 438; Chicago, Junction Ry. Co. v. King, \n222 \nU.S. 222, 224\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 79; Dun v. Lumbermen's Credit Association, \n209 \nU.S. 20, 24\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 335, 14 Ann. Cas. 501. It is a natural inference that Congress in its grant to the Osage Indians in 1872 made it extend to the main channel of the river, only \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 87]\n\u00a0\n because it knew it was not navigable. This would be consistent with its general policy. Section 2476, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  4918); Oklahoma v. Texas, decided May 1, 1922; Scott v. Lattig, \n227 \nU.S. 229, 242\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 242, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 107; Railroad Co. v. Schurmeir, 7 Wall. 272, 289. If the Arkansas river is not navigable, then the title of the Osages as granted certainly included the bed of the river as far as the main channel, because the words of the grant expressly carries the title to that line.\n But it is said that the navigability of the Arkansas river is a local question to be settled by the Legislature and the courts of Oklahoma, and that the Supreme Court of the state has held that at the very point here in dispute, the river is navigable. State v. Nolegs, 40 Okl. 479, 139 Pac. 943. A similar argument was made for the same purpose in Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, based on a decision by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma as to the Red river. Hale v. Record, 44 Okl. 803, 146 Pac. 587. The controlling effect of the state court decision was there denied because the United States had not been there, as it was not here, a party to the case in the state court. Economy Light Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 409. In such a case as this the navigability of the stream is not a local question for the state tribunals to settle. The question here is what title, if any, the Osages took in the river bed in 1872 when this grant was made, and that was thirty-five years before Oklahoma was taken into the Union and before there were any local tribunals to decide any such questions. As to such a grant, the judgment of the state court does not bind us, for the validity and effect of an act done by the United States is necessarily a federal question. The title of the Indians grows out of a federal grant when the Federal government had complete sovereignty over the territory in question. Oklahoma when she came into the Union took sovereignty over the public lands in the condition of ownership as they were then, and if the bed of a nonnavigable stream had then become the property \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 88]\n\u00a0\n of the Osages, there was nothing in the admission of Oklahoma into a constitutional equality of power with other states which required or permitted a divesting of the title. It is not for a state by courts or legislature, in dealing with the general subject of beds of streams to adopt a retroactive rule for determining navigability which would destroy a title already accrued under federal law and grant or would enlarge what actually passed to the state, at the time of her admission, under the constitutional rule of equality here invoked.\n It is true that where the United States has not in any way provided otherwise, the ordinary incidents attaching to a title traced to a patent of the United States under the public land laws may be determined according to local rules; but this is subject to the qualification that the local rules do not impair the efficacy of the grant or the use and enjoyment of the property by the grantee. Thus the right of the riparian owner under such grant may be limited by the law of the state either to high or law water mark or extended to the middle of the streatm. Packer v. Bird, \n137 \nU.S. 661, 669\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 210.\n We said in Oklahoma v. Texas, decided May 1, 1922:\n'Where the United States owns the bed of a nonnavigable stream and the upland on one or both sides, it, of course, is free when disposing of the upland to retain all or any part of the river bed; and whether in any particular instance it has done so is essentially a question of what is intended. If by a treaty or statute or the terms of its patent it has shown that it intended to restrict the conveyance to the upland or to that and a part only of the river bed, that intention will be controlling; and, if its intention be not otherwise shown, it will be taken to have assented that its conveyance should be construed and given effect in this particular according to the law of the state in which the land lies. Where it is disposing of tribal land of the Indians under its guardianship the same rules apply.' \n\n[260 U.S. 77, 89]\n\u00a0\n In government patents containing no words showing purpose to define riparian rights, the intention to abide the state law is inferred. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court in Hardin v. Jordan, \n140 \nU.S. 371, 384\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 808, 813 (35 L. Ed. 428), said:\n\n'In our judgment, the grants of the government for lands bounded on streams and other waters, without any reservation or restriction of terms, are to be construed as to their effect according to the law of the state in which the lands lie.'\n\n Some states have sought to retain title to the beds of streams by recognizing them as navigable when they are not actually so. It seems to be a convenient method of preserving their control. No one can object to it unless it is sought thereby to conclude one whose right to the bed of the river granted and vesting before statehood, depends for its validity on nonnavigability of the stream in fact. In such a case, navigability vel non is not a local question. In Wear v. State of Kansas, \n245 U.S. 154\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 55, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 586, upon which the plaintiffs in error rely, the patent of the United States under which Wear derived title was a grant, made before statehood, to land bordering on the Kansas river without restriction, reservation or expansion. The state tribunal took judicial notice of the navigability of the river, refused to hear evidence thereon, and held that the patent to land on a navigable stream did not convey the bed of the river. The United States by its unrestricted patent was properly taken to have assented to its construction according to the local law. Whether the local law worked its purpose by conclusively determining the navigability of the stream, without regard to the fact, or by expressly denying a riparian title to the bed of a nonnavigable stream, was immaterial. In either view the result there would have been the same. The case of Donnelly v. United States, \n228 U.S. 243\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710, is to be similarly distinguished, if, indeed it can be said after the qualification of the opinion, \n228 \nU.S. 708, 711\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 1024, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710, to require distinguishing.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Chap. CCCX.

MYLROIE(1922)\nNo. 190\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. B. Stratton and Charles H. Farrell, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. H. Gorham, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was begun by a libel in rem filed by A. W. Mylroie, the respondent herein, as owner of the American barge Bangor, and lawful bailee of its cargo, against the British tug Commodore, in the District Court of Alaska. The libel, as later amended, charged, in substance, that the Commodore was engaged in towing the Bangor on a voyage from the international boundary between British Columbia and the state of Washington to Anchorage, Alaska; that the tug at 2 o'clock in the morning on March 26, 1917, being then in Alaskan waters, and out of her course in heavy wind and sea and a snowstorm, sighting land immediately ahead, put her wheel hard over, and under a full head of steam suddenly changed her course to avoid the rocks and reefs on the shore of Mary Island; and that by reason of the snapping strain due to the sudden change of the tug's course, the barge's shackle by which the towline was attached to the barge was broken; that the barge drifted and \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n grounded on Mary Island, Alaska, with consequent damage to the barge and cargo, all through the negligence and carelessness and want of skill and want of knowledge of the waters on the part of those in charge of the tug, and also because of the lack of seaworthiness of the tug, in that it did not have a full complement of men sufficient to keep a proper lookout at the bow of the boat.\n The petitioner joined issue upon these allegations by denying negligence, lack of skill and unseaworthiness, and charged the stranding of the barge with the consequent loss, to the unseaworthiness of the shackle which had been furnished by the barge owner. The tug owner further set up the defense against recovery that he was exempted from liability for negligence because of a clause of the towing contract.\n The District Court found for the owner of the tug and dismissed the libel. It did not find it necessary to determine the effect of the exemption clause of the towing contract, because from a preponderance of the eivdence it found that there was neither negligence nor lack of skill on the part of the tug, and that the accident arose from the breaking of the shackle, which was furnished by the barge owner, and that he had not sustained the claim that it was subject to unusual or unnecessary strain through the negligence of the tug. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the action of the District Court, and took an entirely different view of the effect of the evidence. It found that the tug was unseaworthy, in that it did not have a large enough crew to station a lookout at the bow, and that if it had done so at a time when the emergency required it, it could have avoided putting itself and the barge in the position of danger which resulted in the loss of the barge. It found further that the shackle was a new one with a year's test, and that its breaking was due to the strain caused by the sudden change of the course by the tug when it sighted \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n the rocks of Mary Island immediately ahead, and within dangerous proximity, and put its helm hard down without notice by whistle to the barge to enable the barge by putting its own helm hard down to save itself. it held, moreover, that the clause of the contract relied on by the tug owner exempting him from responsibility for loss to the barge while in tow was void and could form no defense.\n We have read the voluminous evidence in this record, and have compared with care the findings of the two courts. After giving due weight to the findings of the court which heard the witnesses, the examination satisfies us that the District Court was influenced too much by the mere preponderance in number of the witnesses for the tug owner, and that it did not sufficiently consider the significance of certain conceded facts in sustaining the evidence of the fewer witnesses for the barge owner. It was established without contradiction that the night was a dirty one; that there was a succession of snow squalls; that it was very dark; that the proper course of the vessel was from Tree Point light to a point two or three miles off Mary Island upon which there was a light having a wide radius of observation; that the distance from Tree Point light to the place of the wreck was 18 miles, and that the actual course of the vessel in going that 18 miles was more than 2 miles nearer to the shore of Mary Island than it should have been. There was a following wind of at least 30 miles an hour. In the distance which the navigators of the vessel calculated she had run, she would have picked up the Mary Island light a considerable time before the accident, had she been on her right course. This delay in picking up the light should have advised them that she was out of her course and in dangerous proximity to the shore. Their calculations showed that they were only 16 1\/2 miles from Tree Point light when they had really made 18. \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n They did not put out a taffrail log, excusing this on the plea that it was not the custom and would not aid them. They did not try echo signals because they said it would have done no good. They did not try the lead to feel the depth and proximity to shore. No explanation is given of why they departed so far from their course. Suggestions are made of hidden currents, but none are shown to exist there. Several of the expert witnesses called by the tug owner in excusing the conduct of those in charge said that they frequently had found difficulty in making this passage by Mary Island, and were often out of their course. If that is true, and the place is a dangerous one, then it called for additional care on the part of the tug.\n The tug had a captain, a mate and a pilot, so-called, who had shipped as a purser. His name was Bjerre. The captain's name was Johnson, and the mate's naem was Dawe. Bjerre was pecuniarily interested in the company which owned the tug, was its shore captain, and went along to help the captain of the tug, as he explained, because the captain of the tug was not used to outside work-that is, to work in the open ocean-and part of the trip would be in the open ocean. On the stand, Bjerre praised the seamanship of Johnson somewhat extravagantly, and then on cross- examination was obliged to admit that in a subsequent towage of the same barge, he had to discipline Johnson for getting drunk on shore and coming to the vessel drunk-an impeachment of his unstinted praise. It is difficult to avoid the impression that Bjerre went on the trip because the company was not certain of Johnson's capacity to do the work safely. This seems to have been understood by the crew, and explains why it was that the helmsman said that he obeyed the orders of Bjerre, and why the mate explained that he obeyed Bjerre's orders, because he represented the owners. Indeed the vessel seems to have had two captains. \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n The evidence shows that on the night in question, Bjerre and Johnson were both in the wheelhouse; that the mate was there sometimes, and that a helmsman named Charles Croft was at the wheel. Johnson and Bjerre were constantly conferring as to the course and Bjerre professed to be the lookout. The wheelhouse was 40 feet from the stem, and 18 feet above the deck. There was no forecastle on the bow, and there were some obstructions there, but nothing that a man of ordinary height could not have seen over if at the bow, and there was no obstruction to the sight from the wheelhouse. Bjerre testifies that in addition to the snow squalls that night, the following wind had blown the peculiarly dirty smoke, due to the kind of coal they were using, in front of them, and thus produced greater obscurity. This, Bjerre says, had cleared up to some extent because at 1 a. m., as the log shows, they slowed down, though the distance made conflicts with the suggestion of a great reduction of speed. Through all this difficulty of vision, the tug was attempting to make its course and find land.\n There was expert evidence that a lookout could see from the wheelhouse better than from the bow; though some of the experts for the tug testified that under circumstances like these they would have sent a man to the bow as well. We agree with the Court of Appeals that this was a case where a lookout should have been stationed at the bow, and that the difference in position between those in the wheelhouse and the man at the bow would have offered greater opportunity to pick up the land by either the one or the other than where the eyes of the tug were in the wheelhouse only. The emergency was such that the greatest care of this kind was necessary to avoid disaster. It is probable that if a lookout had been put at the bow, he might have seen the rocks for which they were headed at a greater distance than they were seen by Capt. Bjerre. Bjerre says he sighted land \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n when it was half a mile away and Capt. Johnson agrees with him. He is contradicted in this by the helmsman and the supercargo of the barge and the subsequent event.\n The injunctions with respect to the necessity for a lookout devoting his whole attention to the situation ahead, contained in the opinions of this court, are so many that it is hardly necessary to refer to more than one, that of The Ariadne, 13 Wall. 475, in which Mr. Justice Swayne used this language:\n'The duty of the lookout is of the highest importance. Upon nothing else does the safety of those concerned so much depend. A moment's negligence on his part may involve the loss of his vessel, with all the property and the lives of all on board. The same consequence may ensue to the vessel with which his shall collide. In the performance of this duty the law requires indefatigable care and sleepless vigilance. ... It is the duty of all courts, charged with the administration of this branch of our jurisprudence, to give it the fullest effect whenever the circumstances are such as to call for its application. Every doubt as to the performance of the duty, and the effect of nonperformance, should be resolved against the vessel sought to be inculpated until she vindicates herself by testimony conclusive to the contrary.'\n\n Attempt has been made in argument to distinguish cases in which this rule has been applied from the one at bar, on the ground that they were cases in crowded harbors where collisions might have been expected unless great care was taken. Certainly no such distinction can be given weight in this case. A lookout is for the purpose of seeing and advising those navigating the ship of what is in the way, and the danger on a night like the one here presented an exigency requiring the peculiar services of a lookout quite as much as in a crowded harbor. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the dangerous situation in which the tug and her tow were brought can be reasonably charged to the absence of a proper lookout. \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n We come then to the question, what caused the breaking of the shackle? As to that, there is a sharp conflict of evidence between the helmsman, Charles Croft, Capt. Johnson and Capt. Bjerre. Croft testified for the barge owner and the District Judge said his honesty made an impression on him. Croft said that Bjerre jumped to the wheel and took it out of his hand, and put the wheel hard aport, with the statement, 'You are too darned slow;' that he looked out and saw mist on the water, looking like wash upon the rocks; that shortly after the turn, he felt a jar, and asked what it was, that Bjerre answered, 'We have lost the tow,' and then within a short time when Capt. Johnson came, he repeated, 'The damn tow is gone.' Johnson and Bjerre would give the impression in their evidence that Bjerre made out the land about half a mile away; that he ordered the helmsman to change their course two points only, and it was sometime after that when the mate came in and reported that the tow was gone. They said that there was at no time any jar. They said that Croft's story applied to what happened after they had lost the tow and had turned and gone toward the shore to her assistance when suddenly they heard the surf and then had to put their helm hard down to avoid going ashore. Croft is not shown to have had any motive to misstate his evidence or to pervert facts. It is not a situation that he would be likely to forget. The relation and order of events were so clear that they would naturally remain in his mind. Johnson and Bjerre both had very strong motives for their story. The most noteworthy circumstance, however, supporting Croft and shaking the credibility of the two captains, is that though Bjerre and Johnson kept the log, they made no note whatever of the change of course of two points, so that the log does not show anything except '1.45 Barge broke away.' The omission of what it was most natural they should have put down, if it were such a leisurely change \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n as they testify, and one not in excitement and hurry, gives much the greater weight in our judgment to the evidence of the helmsman. It is an indication that the present story is one of later origin than that night. The statement of the helmsman is supported too be the evidence of the men on the barge, who testified to the jar that they felt and then the breaking of the shackle.\n A part of the shackle was recovered. The uncontradicted evidence is that it was bought from a ship chandler a year before, and had been tested by service during that period. Experts were called to testify as to inferences to be drawn from the character of the break in shackle. The most satisfactory witness was called by the barge owner who made the laboratory test and said positively that the break was due to crystallization caused by a sudden strain. The test showed that an arm of the shackle had a tensile strength of 47 tons and less than that of the tow line. On cross-examination, the tow's witness conceded that if the strain was straight and direct and steady, the tensile strength by the two arms of the shackle might be doubled, but not so if the strain fell on one side or the other. As the strain here was necessarily on one side, the shackle became the weakest link in the chain between the tug and the tow.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the breaking of the shackle was due to additional strain or snap of the sudden change of course, and we concur in this view. The change of course by 90 degrees or at a right angle as this was would probably slacken the tow line at first as the tow proceeded on its course and the tug veered, but the progress of the tug on the new course would take up the slack with a jerk.\n The respondent's counsel charges negligence on the part of the tug in not giving notice to the tow of the sudden change of course by whistle. Expert evidence was called on behalf of the tug to show that this was \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n not the custom. Indeed it is not too much to say that the expert evidence in this case as to customs prevailing in navigation in those difficult inside passages on the British Columbia and Alaska coast indicate such a laxity in the use of precautions that we are not inclined to credit it and certainly not to dignify such alleged customs into a standard of due care. The evidence as to the absence of necessity for the use of signals between tug and tow was not satisfying. Indeed it was admitted that at least one of the great towing firms of that region had departed from the so-called custom and had prepared a set of signals to be used between tug and tow, and that this set of signals was on the tug that night. It was not denied that an ordinary signal that the tug was about to change her course would have notified the tow of the maneuver. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that under the circumstances, and in the great emergency, it was negligence not to have warned the tow. Had the tow put her helm hard down, there is every probability that it would have avoided the strain and the break in the shackle.\n Counsel on behalf of the tug owner press us with the argument that there was a device on the tug for taking up and letting out the tow line automatically to relieve the strain, and that this had been set in operation that night. The mate testified that he had his hand on the tow when he felt the jar of the break. If he had his hand on the tow line, it is quite evident that it could not have been paying out fast, and clearly it did not relieve the strain.\n We conclude that the tug was guilty of negligence in taking her tow dangerously near to the shore from which though she was able to escape, she did not help her tow to escape as she might have done by due warning. If she be liable for negligence, she must pay for the loss to the tow and her cargo. \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the question how far the tug is exculpated from liability for negligence by the contract. The clause of the contract relied on by the tug owner is as follows:\n'3. That the tug will render to the said barge Bangor reasonable assistance from time to time in any emergency which might arise, and whilst discharging at Anchorage the tug is to be within call of the barge at all times to render such reasonable assistance in case of any emergency which might arise. The tug company is not to be held liable for any damage which might happen to the said barge Bangor or its cargo while in tow or at anchor.'\n\n The agreement of the tug to render to the barge reasonable assistance from time to time in any emergency which might arise, and the exemption of the tug company from liability for any damage which might happen to the barge or its cargo while in tow, seem in conflict, but it is our duty to reconcile them if we can.\n In Elderslie S. S. Co. v. Borthwick, H. of L. 10 Asp. Mar. Cas. N. S. 24, 26, the House of Lords was called upon to declare the legal effect of a contract of affreightment with an exemption clause relieving the ship, owners, and charterers from liability for negligence of the master or other person in their service, together with a provision that excepted loss or damage from defects in hull if reasonable means hed been taken to provide against such defects. Lord Chancellor (Halsbury) in considering these provisions apparently in conflict, used this language:\n'The true construction of the clause is, according to my view, that he is to be exempted from any liability for the particular injury that has happened, and if that had stood alone I should have thought it perfectly clear that he was not to be liable; but instead of that, he goes no to say in another part of the same contract, to which I must, if I can, give some effect because of that rule of \n\n[259 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n construction from which I can not escape: 'I shall not be liable for this same injury (as I must call it) if all reasonable means have been taken to avoid it.' The only mode of reading as an entire contract that instrument which has those two stipulations in it, is to suppose that you must read the first part of it thus, 'I am not to be liable for this,' and then what comes after it by way of exception, 'I shall not be liable unless I have failed to take all reasonable means against the injury that has happened.' In that way you can read the two together, and you can make a reasonable contract out of it.'\n\n Dealing with the clause in this case in the same way, we must read it to mean that the tug was not to be held liable for any damage which might happen to the barge or its cargo, while in tow, unless the tug should not render reasonable assistance to the tow in an emergency. As our view of the evidence results in the conclusion that the negligence of the tug in not providing a proper lookout created the emergency, and that the tug did not render proper assistance to the tow in the emergency so created, the tug is clearly liable for the loss. This makes it unnecessary for us to consider the contention on behalf of the barge that the exemption clause is void.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals directed a decree for the owner of the tow, and sent the case back for a more satisfactory assessment of damages. We brought the decree here by certiorari under section 240 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217). We now affirm the decree, and remand the case to the District Court for assessment of damages in conformity to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWNE v.

At a first trial a verdict was directed for the defendant on the ground that broker's seller's slips coupled with oral evidence that corresponding buyer's slips were executed, or vice versa, were not competent evidence of the transactions, under the United States Cotton Futures Act. Act of August 11, 1916, c. 313, part A,  4, 39 Stat. 446, 476 (Comp. St.  6309d). The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals after a very satisfactory discussion. Thorn v. Browne, 257 Fed. 519, 168 C. C. A. 469. There followed a second trial in which the verdict was for the plaintiff and a judgment, sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Browne v. Thorn, 272 Fed. 950, that is brought here by writ of error, supplemented by a petition for a writ of certiorari. There is no ground for the writ of error on the record, although the plaintiff in error now, in view of Hill v. Wallace, \n259 U.S. 44\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 453, May 15, 1922, argues that the Cotton Futures Act is void except in the taxing provision enacted as an alternative to compliance with its regulations. A petition for certiorari was granted at the October Term, 1920. \n256 U.S. 689\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 625\n\n\n The first ground relied upon for the petition is that the transactions were gambling transactions. That was the petitioner's contention at the trial, but to put it at the lowest, there was evidence to the contrary, the question was left to the jury with instructions that if the plaintiff knew that the defendant had no intention to deliver or receive the actual cotton they could not recover, and the jury found for the plaintiffs. The defendant contended that his undisclosed intention was enough to defeat the plaintiff's claims; but that is not the law. It is objected that the judge instructed the jury that hedging was lawful, hedging being explained as a means by which manufacturers and others who have to make contracts of purchase or sale in advance secure themselves against the fluctuations \n\n[260 U.S. 137, 140]\n\u00a0\n of the market by counter contracts. Prima facie such transactions are lawful. Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 249\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637.\n The bought and sold notes executed on the Exchange mentioned only the names of the brokers and neither was signed by both the brokers. It is said that the Act of Congress,  4, was not satisfied. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the language of section 4 of the Cotton Futures Act must be read in the light of the decisions upon the similar language of the Statute of Frauds and that the notes were sufficient; assuming without discussion that in this case it was necessary to prove that section 4 was followed. See Bibb v. Allen, \n149 U.S. 481\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 950.\n Perhaps the most serious of the petitioner's defences was that the 2, 000 bales of cotton were sold without authority. As stated by his counsel, on Germany's announcing unrestricted submarine warfare cotton fell and the petitioner telegraphed to the defendants to sell 2,000 bales. The telegram read as follows: 'Stop ten seventeen twenty and ten seventeen fifteen'- which is understood to carry a direction to sell one thousand bales at 17. 20 cents per pound and one thousand at 17.15. But there was clear and sufficient evidence that such stop orders as they were called were understood to direct not only sale at the price mentioned but, if that could not be got, a sale at the next best possible price. The respondents sold at fourteen cents which was the best that could be done. We think it unnecessary to go into further detail to show that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURRILL v. LOCOMOBILE CO(1922)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Harold Hitchcock, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Wm. P. Everts and Edward E. Blodgett, both of Boston, Mass., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits by foreign corporations to recover taxes alleged to have been paid to the defendant, the Treasurer of Massachusetts, under duress, and in obedience to statutes held by this Court to be unconstitutional in International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617, and \n\n[258 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n Locomobile Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 146\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 298. On the merits the defendant says that these taxes were collected under St. 1909, c. 490, part 3,  56, held valid in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 15; that the maximum limit to the tax fixed by that statute, which saved it, was supposed by this Court in the later decisions mentioned to have been removed by a later Act of 1914, c. 724 (\n246 U.S. 145\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617); but that since that time the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that the Act of 1909 was independent of the statute of 1914 and remained valid and unaffected by the latter unconstitutional act (Liquid Carbonic Co. v. Commonwealth, 232 Mass. 19, 121 N. E. 514; Lawton Spinning Co. v. Commonwealth, 232 Mass. 28, 121 N. E. 518). It also says that by section 70 of the Act of 1909 any corporation aggrieved by the exaction of the tax may within six months after payment apply by petition to the Supreme Judicial Court, which shall be the exclusive remedy; that there is a provision in section 71 for prompt repayment of any sum adjudged to have been illegally exacted, and that these sections are a bar to a personal suit.\n It is unnecessary to go farther than to say that we agree with the defendant upon the latter point. As to the construction of the words, they mean, we have no doubt, what was expressed more at length in an earlier statute on the same matter, that the petition 'shall take the place of any and all actions which might otherwise be maintained by such corporation on account of the assessment and collection of such tax, and shall be the exclusive remedy.' Stat. 1867, c. 52,  4; continued with slight change in Pub. Sts. (1882), c. 13,  66, and abridged to the present form in Rev. Laws (1902), c. 14,  67. The words embodied a fixed policy of the State and must stand whether the levy of the tax is good or bad.\n But it is said that a State cannot be up the plaintiffs to suits in its own courts, and this objection coupled with the suggestion that the Legislature might shorten the time \n\n[258 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n still farther or deny all remedy, if the defense is good, prevailed with the judge who decided these cases, as appears from International Paper Co. v. Burrill (D. C.) 260 Fed. 664, 668, 669. We may dispose of the latter point first. The time for filing the petition is not unreasonably short for this class of cases, considering that the statute is dealing with taxes on the one side and business organizations on the other. And it by no means follows that a Legislature may establish an unreasonable limitation because it may establish a reasonable one. We may lay on one side too the cases that show that states cannot confine parties to their own courts for the assertion of admitted rights. The question here is whether the State could not limit the right of foreign corporations coming into it and the liability of its own citizens in the way supposed. It is true that it cannot constitutionally impose certain taxes upon foreign corporations, but if the law of the United States stops there we do not perceive why the State may not provide that only the author of the wrong shall be liable for it, at least when, as here, the remedy offered is adequate and backed by the responsibility of the State. That it may do so is implied in Arkansas Building & Loan Association v. Madden, \n715 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 119.\n The Constitution standing alone without more does not create a paramount unchangeable liability to an action of tort on the part of all persons who may take part in enforcing a state law that it invalidates. It leaves the remedies to Congress and the States. Congress acting under the Constitution has given to the courts of the United States a jurisdiction in equity that speaking broadly, is the same in all the States and follows its own rules. Rev. Sts.  913 (Comp. St.  1536); Boyle v. Zacharie, 6 Pet. 648, 658; McConihay v. Wright, \n121 U.S. 201\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 940. But as to trials at common law, except when the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, the laws of the States are the rules of decision. Rev. \n\n[258 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n Sts.  721 (Comp. St.  1538). Congress has made no provision that governs the liability in this case and therefore has left it to the law of the State where the wrong is done. If there were no statute the common law of Massachusetts would supplement the Constitution as it would supplement the statutes of the State. But the common law of Massachusetts is not superior to its statutes and may be modified by them at the pleasure of the State, at least until in some substantial sense it impairs substantive constitutional rights, which it has not attempted to do. Whether in an otherwise proper case the proceeding given by the statute could be instituted in the District Court is not before us here. See Ames v. Kansas, \n111 U.S. 449\n, 4 Sup.

Without knowledge of the substitution, respondent poured the gasoline upon the firewood, applied a match, an explosion resulted, and he was badly burned. He further \n\n[259 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n claimed that no life preservers had been placed on board, and that his injuries were aggravated by delay attending search for one before he jumped into the water to extinguish his flaming clothes.\n The trial court held 'the basis of the action is negligence,' and instructed by jury according to the common-law rules in respect thereto. It said that if petitioner or its authorized agents negligently filled the can with gasoline and placed it upon the boat, and if by reason of such negligence respondent suffered injury, he was entitled to recover compensatory damages therefor, provided he himself had not been guilty of contributory negligence. Further, that if the injuries resulting directly from the explosion were aggravated because no life preservers had been placed on board, then additional compensation could be awarded for such aggravation. Also that if the explosion occurred without petitioner's negligence, but the absence of life preservers caused aggravation of respondent's injuries, he would be entitled to recover for such injuries as resulted directly from the negligence in respect of the life preservers, but not for those caused solely by the explosion.\n We have heretofore announced the general doctrine concerning rights and liabilities of the parties when one of a crew sustains injuries while on a vessel in navigable waters:\n'The vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued. ...\n\n'The vessel and her owner are, both a by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries received by seamen in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship. ...\n\n'All the members of the crew, except perhaps the master, are, as between themselves, fellow servants, and hence \n\n[259 U.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n seamen cannot recover for injuries sustained through the negligence of another member of the crew beyond the expense of their maintenance and cure.\n\n'The seaman is not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member of the crew, but is entitled to maintenance and cure, whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident.'\n\n The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S.

West v. Camden, \n135 \nU.S. 507, 521\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 838.\n Considering the custom prevailing in those waters and other clearly established facts, in the present cause, we think the trial court might have told the jury that without regard to negligence the vessel was unseaworthy when she left the dock if the can marked 'coal oil' contained gasoline; also that she was unseaworthy if no life preservers were then on board; and that if thus unseaworthy and one of the crew received damage as the direct result thereof, he was entitled to recover compensatory damages.

The verdict shows that the jury found gasoline had been negligently placed in the can or that through negligence no life preservers were put on board, or that both of these defaults existed, and that as a result of one or both respondent suffered injury without contributory negligence on his part. In effect the charge was more favorable to the petitioner than it could have demanded, \n\n[259 U.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n and we think no damage could have resulted from the erroneous theory adopted by the trial court.

CITY OF BRATTLEBORO(1922)\nNo. 128\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n This was a suit in assumpsit by the petitioner, the Champlain Realty Company, to recover $484.50 and interest from the town of Brattleboro, Vt., being the amount of taxes levied on logs of pulpwood of the petitioner floating in the West river in that town on April 1, 1919, and paid by the petitioner under protest as illegally collected, because the logs were then in transit in interstate commerce to Hinsdale, N. H. The suit \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 367]\n\u00a0\n was brought in the county court, and, the defendant having failed to set the cause for jury trial within the time fixed by statute, it was heard by the court, which made findings of fact that under the state practice are conclusive on review by the Supreme Court. The county court gave judgment for the Realty Company. The town took the case on exceptions to the Supreme Court.\n The Supreme Court (95 Vt. 216, 113 Atl. 806) summarized the findings of fact by the county court as follows:\n'During the winter of 1918-19 the plaintiff cut pulpwood, in all about 10,000 cords, in the towns of Jamaica, Stratton, Londonderry and Winhall in this state. The plaintiff maintains a mill at Hinsdale, in the state of New Hampshire, about three miles below Brattleboro, where its pulpwood is rossed and bolted. The wood, cut four feet long, was placed upon the banks of West river and its tributaries to be floated down into the Connecticut and thence to its destination at the mill in Hinsdale. The waters of the West river are wholly in this state and empty in the town of Brattleboro into the Connecticut. West river and its tributaries had been used for driving pulpwood to the mill at Hinsdale in the years 1917 and 1918. A single log boom is provided at the mill to receive the wood floated down the river, but is incapable of holding it all when the water in the Connecticut is high and the current swift, and the wood is liable to be carried over and drawn under the boom and lost. A pond of considerable size is formed near the mouth of West river in the town of Brattleboro by water set back from the Connecticut by the dam at Vernon. Plaintiff maintains a boom at this point to hold and control the logs driven down West river until the water in the Connecticut has receded sufficiently to permit of their being held in the boom at Hinsdale.\n\n'On March 25, 1919, the plaintiff began putting the pulpwood into the West river and its tributaries, the \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 368]\n\u00a0\n water in these streams then being high, intending to drive it down the river and thence into the Connecticut and down that river to its mill in Hinsdale. In anticipation of the probable high water in the Connecticut, plaintiff had previously placed its boom across West river near its mouth to hold the wood there until the water in the Connecticut had receded enough to allow it to be held at the mill at Hinsdale. The wood floated down West river on the high water and the head of the drive reached the boom at the mouth of West river on March 27, 1919. At that time the Connecticut was so high and its current so swift that it was not thought safe to let the wood into that river, as it could not be held at the Hinsdale boom. For this reason and no other the plaintiff held its wood in the boom at Brattleboro. The Connecticut was not suitable for driving pulpwood from the time the drive began until April 3d, on which date the plaintiff's servants cut the boom at the mouth of West river so that the wood could pass into the Connecticut. Prior to April 3d only about 4,000 cords of the wood had reached and been held at the West river boom. The balance arriving later went through to Hinsdale without stopping. On March 28, 1919, when there was by estimation about 4,000 cords of wood in the West river boom, it broke, allowing some of the wood to escape into the Connecticut, and onto the Retreat meadow in Brattleboro, near the mouth of West river. The boom was repaired on March 29, 1919. At this time the part of West river where the wood lay back of the boom, called the holding ground, was frozen, so the wood, if not boomed, could not have continued on its journey into the Connecticut at that time. On April 1, 1919, about 1,500 cords of the pulpwood was being held in plaintiff's boom at the mouth of West river. Some wood that was lodged on an island and the wood on the Retreat meadow remained after the boom was cut. The latter remained on the meadow about two weeks and had \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n to be taken out by a process called 'booming' or 'warping.' None of this 1, 500 cords was cut in the town of Brattleboro. All of it had been carried down West river and was destined for the plaintiff's mill at Hinsdale, N. H., by way of the Connecticut. The drive of pulpwood down West river to the Connecticut and thence to the rossing plant at Hinsdale was in continuous operation from March 25th until it was completed on May 9th, and was conducted properly to make an uninterrupted passage, so far as possible.'\n\n On these findings the Supreme Court held that the interstate transit did not begin until the wood left the Brattleboro boom. Everything before that was merely preparations. The floating of the logs from the West river towns to Hinsdale was interrupted, and the interruption, although only long enough to secure safety in the drive, was for the benefit of the owner, and in law postponed the initial step in the interstate transit until the wood was released from the Brattleboro boom. The court, therefore, held the wood taxable at Brattleboro and reversed the county court.\n Messrs. Wm. C. Cannon, of New York City, and M. P. Maurice, of Brattleboro, Vt., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Arthur P. Carpenter and Ernest W. Gibson, both of Brattleboro, Vt., for respondent.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 366, 371]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief JUSTICE TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Vermont Supreme Court depended for its conclusions chiefly upon Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475, which is the leading case on this subject. There logs had been cut on Wentworth's Location in New Hampshire during the winter and had been drawn down to Errol in the same state, and placed in Clear stream and on the banks thereof on lands of John Akers and part on land of George C. Demerritt in said town, to be from thence floated down the Androscoggin river to the state of Maine. \n116 U.S. 518\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475.\n It is not clear how long they had lain there, but certainly for part of one winter season. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, sought to fix the time when \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 372]\n\u00a0\n such logs, in the course of their being taken from New Hampshire to Maine, ceased to be part of the mass of property of New Hampshire and passed into the immunity from state taxation as things actually in interstate commerce. The learned Justice states the rule to be:\n'That such goods do not cease to be part of the general mass of property in the state, subject, as such, to its jurisdiction, and to taxation in the usual way, until they have been shipped, or entered with a common carrier for transportation to another state, or have been started upon such transportation in a continuous route or journey.' \n116 U.S. 527\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 478.\n\n Again, on page 528 of 116 U. S., on page 479 of 6 Sup. Ct. (29 L. Ed. 715), Justice Bradley said:\n'The carrying of them in carts or other vehicles, or even floating them, to the depot where the journey is to commence is no part of that journey. That is all preliminary work, performed for the purpose of putting the property in a state of preparation and readiness for transportation. Until actually launched on its way to another state, or committed to a common carrier for transportation to such state, its destination is not fixed and certain. It may be sold or otherwise disposed of within the state, and never put in the course of transportation out of the state. Carrying it from the farm, or the forest, to the depot, is only an interior movement of the property, entirely within the state, for the purpose, it is true, but only for the purpose of putting it into a course of exportation; it is no part of the exportation itself. Until shipped or started on its final journey out of the state its exportation is a matter altogether in fieri and not at all a fixed and certain thing.\n\n'The application of these principles to the present case is obvious. The logs which were taxed, and the tax on which was not abated by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, had not, when so taxed, been shipped or started on their final voyage or journey to the state of \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 373]\n\u00a0\n Maine. They had only been drawn down from Wentworth's Location to Errol, the place from which they were to be transported to Lewiston in the state of Maine. There they were to remain until it should be convenient to send them to their destination.'\n\n The question here then is: Where did the interstate shipment begin? When the wood was placed in the waters of the West river in the towns of Jamaica, Stratton, Londonderry and Winhall, or at the boom in Brattleboro? The whole drive was 10,000 cords. Six thousand cords of that, shipped from these towns after the 3d of April, went through directly to Hinsdale, N. H ., without stopping. Certainly that was a continuous passage, and the wood when floating in the West river was as much in interstate commerce as when on the Connecticut. Why was it any more in interstate commerce than that which had been shipped before April 3d from the same towns for the same destination by the same natural carrying agency, to wit, the flowing water of the West and Connecticut rivers? Did the fact that before April 3d the waters of the Connecticut were frozen, or so high as to prevent the logs reaching Hinsdale, requiring a temporary halting at the mouth of the West river, break the real continuity of the interstate journey? We think not. The preparation for the interstate journey had all been completed at the towns on the West river where the wood had been put in the stream. The boom at the mouth of the West river did not constitute an entrepot or depot for the gathering of logs preparatory for the final journey. It was only a safety appliance in the course of the journey. It was a harbor of refuge from danger to a shipment on its way. It was not used by the owner for any beneficial purpose of his own except to facilitate the safe delivery of the wood at Hinsdale on their final journey already begun. The logs were not detained to be classified, measured, counted, \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 374]\n\u00a0\n or in any way dealt with by the owner for his benefit, except to save them from destruction in the course of their journey that, but for natural causes, over which he could exercise no control, would have been actually continuous. This was not the case in Coe v. Errol. It is evident from the statement of that case, and Mr. Justice Bradley's language that the logs were partly drawn and partly floated to Errol, and deposited some in the stream and some on the banks, where 'they were to remain until it should be convenient to send them to their destination,' and they were being gathered there for the whole previous winter season. It was an entrepot or depot, as the Justice several times describes it. The mere fact that the owner intended to send them out of the state under such circumstances did not put them into transit in interstate commerce. But here we have the intention put into accomplishment by launching, and manifested by an actually continuous journey of more than half the drive, with a halting of less than half of it in the course of the interstate journey to save it from loss, and only for that purpose.\n The case at bar is easily distinguishable from the other cases cited by the Vermont Supreme Court. In Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299, Bacon had bought shipments of grain in transitu from Western States to New York in the contract for which the carriers had given the shipper the right to remove it 'for the mere temporary purposes of inspecting, weighing, cleaning, clipping, drying, sacking, grading or mixing, or changing the ownership, consignee or destination.' On arrival of the grain in Chicago, Bacon removed the grain from the cars to his private elevator. This removal was for the purpose of inspecting, weighing, grading, mixing, etc., but not to change its ownership, consignee, or destination. It was held that, whatever his intention, the grain was at rest, within his complete power of disposition, and held for his \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 375]\n\u00a0\n own benefit and was taxable. His storing of the grain was not to facilitate interstate shipment of the grain, or save it from the danger of the journey. It was to enable him to treat the grain, so as to enable him more conveniently to dispose of it. He made his warehouse a depot for its preparation for further shipment and sale. He had thus suspended the interstate commerce journey and brought the grain within the taxable jurisdiction of the state.\n So, in General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 U.S. 211\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 475, the Oil Company had its principal place of business in Memphis, Tenn., for the manufacture and sale of illuminating oils in interstate commerce. It imported oil from other states and put it into a tank, appropriately marked for distribution in smaller vessels to fill orders for oil already sold in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The court held that the first shipment had ended, that its storage at Memphis for division and distribution to various points was for the business purposes and profit of the company. The court continued:\n'It was only there for distribution, it is said, to fulfill orders already received. But to do this required that the property be given a locality in the state beyond a mere halting in its transportation.' \n209 U.S. 231\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 482.\n\n The tank at Memphis thus became a depot in its oil business for preparing the oil for another interstate journey. So far as it bears upon this case, American Steel and Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 365, presented a similar state of facts and ruling.\n In Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 U.S. 82\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 266, the company cut 180,000,000 feet of timber for the purpose of saving the same from fire, and to protect and preserve it, put it into the Ontonagon river, Mich. It was drawn down to the mouth of the river into the township of Ontonagon, Mich., to the sorting ground and pier jams of the company and there it was taxed. The logs remained there and were \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 376]\n\u00a0\n shipped as they were needed to Green Bay, Wis., to the mills of the company. Not more than 40,000,000 feet a season were needed. Palpably the company's sorting grounds and pier jams were a depot for the keeping of the logs for the business purposes of the company, and there was no interstate commerce until the final shipment to Green Bay began.\n In the cases of Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091, and Pittsburg Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 U.S. 577\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 415, the coal in barges in the Mississippi river which was the subject of taxation had come to rest in Louisiana, after a trip from Pittsburg, and was being held for sale to any one who might wish to buy.\n The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution does not give immunity to movable property from local taxation which is not discriminative unless it is in actual continuous transit in interstate commerce. When it is shipped by a common carrier from one state to another, in the course of such an uninterrupted journey it is clearly immune. The doubt arises when there are interruptions in the journey, and when the property in its transportation is under the complete control of the owner during the passage. If the interruptions are only to promote the safe or convenient transit, then the continuity of the interstate trip is not broken. State v. Engle, Receiver, 34 N. J. Law, 425, 435; State v. Carrigan, 39 N. J. Law, 36. This was the case in Kelley v. Rhoads, \n188 U.S. 1\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 259, in which sheep driven 500 miles from Utah to Nebraska which traveled 9 miles a day were held immune from taxation in Wyoming where they stopped ond grazed on their way. Another instance is as to that part of the logs in Coe v. Errol, which were not before this court because the Supreme Court of New Hampshire had found them nontaxable in New Hampshire. They were cut in Maine and were floated down the Androscoggin on their way to Lewiston, Me., but were delayed for a season at Errol, \n\n[260 U.S. 366, 377]\n\u00a0\n N. H., because of low water. In the cases just cited the transit had begun in one state and was continued through another on the way to a third. This circumstance strengthened the inference that the interruption in the intermediate state did not destroy interstate continuity of the trip. But this was not always so, as Bacon v. Illinois and General Oil Co. v. Crain show. In other words, in such cases interstate continuity of transit is to be determined by a consideration of the various factors of the situation. Chief among these are the intention of the owner, the control he retains to change destination, the agency by which the transit is effected, the actual continuity of the transportation, and the occasion or purpose of the interruption during which the tax is sought to be levied.\n Of all the cases in this court where such movable property has been held taxable, none is nearer in its facts than Coe v. Errol to the case at bar. We have pointed out the distinction between the two, which requires a different conclusion here.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARLOTTE HARBOR & N R. CO. v. WELLES(1922)\nNo. 188\nArgued: October 4, 1922Decided: October 16, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 8, 9]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Kenneth I. McKay, of Tampa, Fla., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Bill in equity to declare illegal the creation of a special road and bridge district, designated as the Charlotte Harbor special road and bridge district, in De Soto county, Fla., and to restrain the defendants in error, as and constituting the board of county commissioners, from paying out any funds in settlement of any supposed obligations contracted for work done in pursuance of the plan proposed, and, further, to enjoin the commissioners until the final hearing in this cause from contracting any further obligations or paying out any further moneys on account of the construction of roads and bridges under the plan proposed, and for such other and further relief as equity may require.\n The ground of the suit and the relief prayed is that the district was constituted of territory which overlapped territory included in another district theretofore created, and that therefore the board of commissioners to which the creation of the district was committed by the law of the state, as the law then existed, was without power to establish the district. \n\n[260 U.S. 8, 10]\n\u00a0\n The board of commissioners demurred to the bill, and alleged as the grounds thereof the insufficiency of the bill to authorize equitable relief, and besides alleged that complainant was estopped by not complaining earlier, and by its delay had permitted the expenditures of money by the board of commissioners.\n The demurrer was sustained, and a decree entered dismissing the bill. The decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, and to its decision this writ of error is directed.\n The opinion of the court considers and disposes of all state questions, including the one pertinent to our consideration; that is, that the Legislature had power to create special road and bridge districts which overlapped, and having that power, it also had the power 'to pass an act curing or validating the action of the county commissioners in creating a special road and bridge district partly lying in another special road and bridge district.' 'This,' the court said, 'seems to be the general ruling. 8 Cyc. 1023, and numerous authorities cited in the footnote.'\n The court, therefore, sustained the act which is attacked, taking judicial notice of it; it having been passed pending the suit (chapter 8024, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1919). The court said it was passed for the special purpose of validating the action of the commissioners, 'and legalizing and validating the assessments made for the construction of the roads and bridges' in the newly created district, the indebtedness incurred and the warrants issued for the payment of the expenses incident thereto, or which should thereafter issue, and also validated and legalized the assessments and levy of taxes in the district.\n The court further said that that doctrine had theretofore been recognized in the state. Cases were adduced, and, adopting the language of one of them, the conclusion was expressed that, in consequence of such legislation, \n\n[260 U.S. 8, 11]\n\u00a0\n the complainant had no standing in court or right to any relief by reason of the matters complained of in its bill.\n In a petition for rehearing, plaintiff in error attacked the reasoning and conclusion of the court, and asserted against them the inhibition of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which precludes a state from a taking of property without due process of law. The specification of the grounds is that:\n'The said bill [to quote from it] attempts to legalize a proceeding of the county commissioners of De Soto county, Fla., who were mere administrative officers, and which proceeding was void ab initio and without jurisdiction, and under which proceeding certain taxes were levied against the property of your petitioner, prior to the passage of said act of the Legislature, and therefore the said act of the Legislature, in so far as it purports to create a liability on your orator for taxes previously assessed against your orator under a proceeding of said administrative officers, is void ab initio and without jurisdiction.'\n\n The court considered the petition for rehearing and denied it.\n In support of the contention of the petition, plaintiff in error makes a distinction between a curative statute, which it is conceded a Legislature has the power to pass, and a creative statute, which, it is the assertion, a Legislature has not the power to pass. The argument in support of the distinction is ingenious and attractive, but we are not disposed to review it in detail.\n The general and established proposition is that what the Legislature could have authorized, it can ratify if it can authorize at the time of ratification. United States v. Heinszen, \n206 U.S. 370\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688; Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 U.S. 207\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 66; Stockdale v. Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323. And the power is necessary that government may not be defeated by omissions or inaccuracies in the exercise \n\n[260 U.S. 8, 12]\n\u00a0\n of functions necessary to its administration. To this accommodation, Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners of Everglades District, \n258 U.S. 338\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 325,1 is not militant. The case concedes the power of ratification and declares the principle upon which it is based, and necessarily recognized the subjection and obligation of persons and property to government, and for government, and its continuation for the purposes of government. And the recognition precludes a misunderstanding of the case and its extension beyond its facts. It was concerned with an attempt to impose a charge for the use of a government canal, for which use, at the time availed of, there was no charge-an attempt, therefore, to turn a gratuity conferred and enjoyed into a legal obligation and subject it to a toll.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No. 188 of last term, decided April 10. \n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & N.W.

Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. H. Wilson, of Lincoln, Neb. (Messrs. Elmer J. Burkett, Elmer W. Brown, and Ralph P. Wilson, all of Lincoln, Neb., on the brief), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent Produce Company recovered a judgment against petitioner, the delivering carrier, for damages to two carloads of apples transported during November, 1914, upon through bills of lading over connecting lines from points in New York state to one in Nebraska. The evidence tended to show that the apples were in good condition when received by the initial carrier, but were frozen when delivered at destination. Where the damage occurred was not shown.\n Petitioner moved for a directed verdict, claiming no recovery could be had against it without affirmative evidence that it caused the damage. Having denied this motion, the court instructed the jury that there was a presumption of damage upon the line of the last carrier, and the Supreme Court of Nebraska approved the charge.\n The single question now presented for consideration is whether, since the Carmack Amendment (Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa) a presumption arises that the injury occurred on the delivering carrier's line, when goods moving in interstate commerce upon a through bill of lading are delivered in bad condition and the evidence shows they were sound when received by the initial carrier, but does not affirmatively establish where the loss occurred.\n It is established doctrine that the rights and liabilities in respect of damage to goods moving in interstate commerce \n\n[258 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n under through bills of lading depend upon acts of Congress, agreements between the parties and common-law principles accepted and enforced in the federal courts. New York Central, etc., R. R. v. Beaham, \n242 \nU.S. 148, 151\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 43. While this court has not expressly approved it, we think the common-law rule, supported both by reason and authority, is correctly stated in section 1348, Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.):\n'A connecting carrier, who has completed the transportation and delivered the goods to the consignee in a damaged condition or deficient in quantity, will be held liable in an action for the damage or deficiency, without proof that it was occasioned by his fault, unless he can show that he received them in the condition in which he has delivered them. The condition and quantity of the goods when they were delivered to the first of the connecting carriers being shown, the presumption will arise that they continued in that condition down to the time of their delivery to the carrier completing the transportation and making the delivery to the consignee, and that the injury or loss occurred while they were in his possession.'\n\n Some of the pertinent cases are collected in the note below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[258 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner insists that this common-law rule conflicts with the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 595,2 which requires issuance of a through bill of lading by initial carrier and declares it liable for damage occurring anywhere along the route, as interpreted and applied by this court. But we find no inconsistency between the amendment or any other federal legislation and the challenged rule. Properly understood, Charleston, etc., Ry. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., \n237 U.S. 597\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 715, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 333, especially relied upon gives no support to the contrary view.\n That cause involved the South Carolina statute which imposed a penalty of $50 upon the carrier for failure to pay within 40 days for damages suffered by goods transported in interstate commerce. The opinion expressly states, 'The defendant contended that the law imposing the penalty was invalid under the Act to Regulate Commerce, especially section 20, as amended by the Act of June 29, 1906, ... known as the Carmack Amendment,' refers to the penalty as 'the only matter that we are considering,' and points out that 'the state law was not contrived in aid of the policy of Congress, but to enforce a state policy differently conceived.' As the Supreme Court of South Carolina sustained the act and permitted \n\n[258 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n recovery of the penalty, its judgment was necessarily reversed.\n Here there is no question of conflict between a state statute and any federal policy; and nothing in the words of the amendment indicates a legislative purpose to abrogate the accepted common-law doctrine concerning presumption. The suggestion that by imposing additional liability upon the initial carrier the amendment provides an adequate remedy for shippers, and thereby removes the necessity for any presumption against the terminal one and impliedly abrogates the rule, is unsound. There are adequate reasons why shippers should have the benefit of both; and we think Congress so intended.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Smith v.

RY. CO. v. NYE-SCHNEIDER-FOWLER CO.(1922)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 35, 36]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wymer Dressler, of Omaha, Neb., Thos. P. Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., and F. W. Sargent, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Garrard Glenn, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice taft delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case, the constitutional validity of two statutes of Nebraska is questioned; the first subjecting the initial railroad of two connecting roads, receiving freight, to liability for safe delivery by the other, and the second making every common carrier liable for a reasonable attorney's fee in the court of first instance and on appeal, for collection from it of every claim for damage or loss to property shipped, not adjusted within 60 days for intrastate shipments.\n The Nye-Schneider-Fowler Company, defendant in error, is a corporation of Nebraska at Fremont, Nebraska, \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the business of bringing hogs in the state and shipping them to South Omaha for sale in the stockyards there. It brought this suit against the plaintiff in error, a common carrier, to recover damages in the sum of $ 2,097.21 and $900 attorney's fees, for loss or injury to hogs shipped in 105 intrastate shipments, averring due presentation of such claims and the refusal of the company to pay any amount whatever on them. The jury returned a verdict of $802.27, with interest at 7 per cent., as provided in the statute. On motion, the court fixed the reasonable attorney's fees in the suit at $600 as part of the costs and judgment for verdict and costs was accordingly entered. By the Supreme Court of the state, to which the defendant company appealed the cause, a remittitur was required and consented to for $209.01 on the amount recovered for loss and damage, and the fee of $600 taxed as costs was reduced to $200; but the Supreme Court taxed the plaintiff in error with an attorney's fee of $100 for services in the Supreme Court and judgment was entered accordingly. The questions made involved separate statutes and we shall take them up in order.\n First. Section 6058 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska provides as follows:\n'Any railroad company receiving freight for transportation shall be entitled to the same rights and be subject to the same liabilities as common carriers. Whenever two or more railroads are connected together, the company owning either of such roads, receiving freight to be transported to any place on the line of either of the roads so connected shall be liable as common carriers for the delivery of such freight, to the consignee of the freight, in the same order in which such freight was shipped.'\n\n It is objected that this imposes on one railroad liability for the default of another without providing reimbursement by that other and so deprives the one of its property \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 38]\n\u00a0\n without due process of law. But the Supreme Court of Nebraska has declared in this case that in such a case, under the statute, the initial carrier has a right of reimbursement under the general principle of subrogation. This conclusion is sound and is supported by Texas & Pacific Railroad Co. v. Eastin, 100 Tex. 556, 102 S. W. 105, and the general principle involved finds support in Fisher v. Milwaukee Ry., 173 Wis. 57, 180 N. W. 269, Arnold v. Green, 116 N. Y. 566, 571, 23 N. E. 1, Syracuse Lighting Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 226 N. Y. 25, 122 N. E. 723, and Holmes v. Balcom, 84 Me. 226, 24 Atl. 821. Counsel for the plaintiff in error contends that the Legislature has granted no such right of subrogation in this statute; that it is not a right, but purely a matter of equity under the circumstances. We cannot follow this distinction. We have here a construction of this statute by the Supreme Court of the state, in which that tribunal holds that, under all the circumstances to which this statute can apply, subrogation does exist. The initial carrier is, therefore, certainly protected within the jurisdiction within which the statute operates, and, as no doubt can arise as to the enjoyment of the right, it is immaterial whether it was originally founded on the common law or was developed in the broader justice of equity jurisprudence.\n Second. Authority for taxing of attorney's fees as part of the costs in such cases is founded in chapter 134, Laws of Nebraska 1919, amending section 6063, Revised Statutes 1913, which reads as follows:\n'Every claim for loss or damage to property in any manner, or overcharge for freight for which any common carrier in the state of Nebraska may be liable, shall be adjusted and paid by the common carrier delivering such freight at the place of destination within sixty days, in cases of shipment or shipments wholly within the state, and within ninety days in cases of shipment or shipments between points without and points within the state, after \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 39]\n\u00a0\n such claim, stating the amount and nature thereof accompanied by the bill of lading or duplicate bill of lading or shipping receipt showing amount paid for or on account of said shipment, which shall be returned to the complainant when the claim is rejected or the time limit has expired, shall have been filed with the agent, or the common carrier at the point of destination of such shipment, or at the point where damages in any other manner may be caused by any common carrier. In the event such claim, which shall have been filed as above provided, within ninety days from the date of the delivery of the freight in regard to which damages are claimed, is not adjusted and paid within the time herein limited, such common carrier shall be liable for interest thereon at seven per cent. per annum from the date of filing of such claim, and shall also be liable for a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court, all to be recovered by the consignee or consignor, or real party in interest, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and in the event an appeal be taken and the plaintiff shall succeed, such plaintiff shall be entitled to recover an additional attorney fee to be fixed by such court or courts: Provided, in bringing suit for the recovery of any claim for loss or damage as herein provided if consignee or consignor, or real party in interest, shall fail to recover a judgment in excess of the amount that may have been tendered in an offer of settlement of such claim by the common carrier liable hereunder, then such consignee or consignor, or real party in interest, shall not recover the interest penalty or attorney's fee herein provided.'\n\n The Supreme Court of the state has held that provision for attorney's fees in this section is in the nature of reimbursement of costs and not a penalty. Smith v. Railway Co., 99 Neb. 719, 157 N. W. 622; Marsh v. Railway Co., 103 Neb. 654, 173 N. W. 679. But this does not meet the objection pressed on us. \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 40]\n\u00a0\n These are costs imposed on the defeated defendant in the litigation, but not on the defeated plaintiff. This is an inequality and the question is whether it is a just discrimination and one which the Legislature may make and not take the defeated defendant's property without due process or deny it the equal protection of the law. We have considered in our more recent decisions the constitutional validity of inequalities of this general character as between claimants and common carriers created by state legislation, and it may perhaps be worth while to review the decisions to see what general rule runs through them with a view of applying it to the case before us.\n In the first of these cases, Gulf, etc., Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 255, a defendant railroad company attacked a statute of Texas under which it had been required to pay an attorney's fee to the plaintiff. The statute provided that any person having a claim for personal services, for overcharges for freight, or for claims for stock killed if it did not exceed $50, which was duly presented and not settled in 30 days, might, if he recovered the full amount in a suit, recover also an attorney's fee not exceeding $10 if he had an attorney. This court, three Judges dissenting, held that the statute denied the equal protection of the laws to railroads because it was only a penalty to compel them to pay their debts, and that to single them out as a group of general debtors was not just classification.\n In Atchison, etc., R. C. Co. v. Mattews, \n174 U.S. 96\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 609, a statute relating to the liability of railroads for damages for fire caused by their negligent operation, allowed the plaintiff if he recovered a reasonable attorney's fee. This was held a valid classification of defendants because it was a police measure to prevent fire likely to be caused by operation of railroads and the attorney's fee stimulated care to prevent it.\n In Seaboard Air Line v. Seegers, \n207 U.S. 73\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 28, a state statute imposed a penalty of $50 on all common carriers \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 41]\n\u00a0\n for failure to adjust damage claims within 40 days if in the subsequent litigation the plaintiff recovered the full amount claimed. The statute was sustained in a case where the claim was $1.75. It was held not to be a statute imposing a penalty merely for the nonpayment of debts or against railroad corporations alone as in the Ellis Case, but one based solely upon the nature of the business peculiarly within the knowledge of the carrier who could determine the loss more accurately and with less delay than the plaintiff. It was said that the design was to secure a reasonably prompt settlement of proper claims, and especially small claims which most need such penal provisions to protect them.\n In St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co. v. Wynne, \n224 U.S. 354\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 493, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 102, a state statute required railroad companies to pay claims for live stock killed or injured by their trains within 30 days after notice with a penalty for failure to do so, of double damages and attorney's fee if claimant recovered what he sued for. The plaintiff had made a claim for $500 for the killing of two horses by the defendant's train. On refusal, suit was brought for $400 and recovery had for that amount. It was held that to apply the statute as the state court did, to a case in which plaintiff had demanded more than he sued for, made an arbitrary exercise of power and deprived defendant of its property without due process of law.\n In Kansas City Ry. v. Anderson, \n233 U.S. 325\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 599, the same statute which was held invalid in the Wynne Case was again before the court for consideration as applied to a case where plaintiff had not demanded more than he sued for and recovered, and the validity of the statute was upheld.\n In Yazoo, etc., R. R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 U.S. 217\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 40, the statute required every common carrier to settle claims for lost or damaged \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 42]\n\u00a0\n freight within 60 days and made it liable for $25 damages in each case in addition to the actual damages, but limited the penalty to claims of less than $200. The claim was $4.76 and there was a recovery of the claim and penalty. Such a statute was held a reasonable incentive to the prompt settlement without suit of just demands of a class admitting of special legislative treatment. It was objected to the statute that it intended the assessment of a penalty whether the recovery was less than the claim or not. But the court refused to consider the objection on the ground that it sufficed to hold that as applied to cases like those before it the statute was valid, and that it would not deal with imaginary cases or speculate on what application the state court would make of the statute in another class of cases.\n In Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. Polt, \n232 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 301, the state statute made a railroad company absolutely responsible for loss of property destroyed by fire communicated from its locomotives and provided that unless it paid or offered to pay the full amount of the damage within 60 days from notice, the owner should have double damages unless he recovered less than the amount offered by the company before suit. The plaintiff demanded and sued for $833.30. The company offered $500. The verdict was for $780. The court said that the rudiments of fair play required by the Fourteenth Amendment were wanting when a defendant in such a case was compelled to guess rightly what a jury would find or pay double if that tribunal added a cent to the amount tendered, though the tender was futile because of an excessive demand.\n In Missouri, etc., Co. v. Cade, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 678, a statute regulating the presentation and collection of claims for personal service, material furnished, overcharges for freight, for lost or damaged freight or for stock killed or injured against any person or corporation \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 43]\n\u00a0\n less than $200 in amount, required that they be settled in 30 days, and, if not, the person injured could bring suit, and, if he recovered the full amount of his claim, he should be entitled in addition to the amount and costs, to a reasonable attorney's fee, not exceeding $20. It was held that the attorney's fee here was manifestly only costs of suit, and that, as the statute applied to every one and any person might be plaintiff or defendant, the mere distinction between the costs to be taxed against the plaintiff and those against the defendant did not deny the equal protection of the laws because the plaintiff usually had the burden in the case and as the outlay for an attorney's fee was a necessary consequence of the litigation, it was reasonable to impose it upon the party whose refusal to pay the just claim rendered the litigation necessary.\n In Atchison Ry. v. Vosburg, \n238 U.S. 56\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 675, L. R. A. 1915E, 953, a statute requiring prompt furnishing cars by carriers and prompt loading by shippers and which imposed the same penalty per car upon delinquents of either group but which added attorney's fee to the penalty imposed on the carriers in case of recovery by a shipper, was held to deny to the carriers the equal protection of the laws because in such a case there was no ground for putting the carriers in a different class from the shippers and imposing a special burden on them when they were both in identically the same situation.\n The general rule to be gathered from this extended review of the cases is that common carriers engaged in the public business of transportation may be grouped in a special class to secure the proper discharge of their functions, and to meet their liability for injuries inflicted upon the property of members of the public in their performance; that the seasonable payment of just claims against them for faulty performance of their functions is a part of their duty, and that a reasonable penalty may be imposed on them for failure promptly to consider and \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 44]\n\u00a0\n pay such claims, in order to discourage delays by them. This penalty or stimulus may be in the form of attorney's fees. But it is also apparent from these cases that such penalties or fees must be moderate and reasonably sufficient to accomplish their legitimate object and that the imposition of penalties or conditions that are plainly arbitrary and oppressive and 'violate the rudiments of fair play' insisted on in the Fourteenth Amendment, will be held to infringe it. In this scrutiny of the particular operation of a statute of this kind, we have sustained it in its application to one set of facts by the state court and held it invalid when applied to another. In some of the cases in which the statutes are sustained there is a fixed penalty or a limited attorney's fee. In others, the attorney's fee is merely required to be reasonable and fixed by the court. In some, there is a limit in the amount of the claims to which the statute applies, and in others not. In some statutes held valid, the penalty or fee is allowed only on condition that the full amount claimed be recovered; in others, that the amount sued for be recovered. In the one case, the statute imposed no condition upon the imposition of a penalty that the full amount claimed or sued for should be recovered, but the court refused to consider the validity of the penalty from that standpoint because the facts did not require it. In another case, the requirement that a tender of the amount recovered could only save double damages was held invalid, because requiring a guess as to the verdict of the jury.\n It is obvious that it is not practical to draw a line of distinction between these cases based on a difference of particular limitations in the statute and the different facts in particular cases. The court has not intended to establish one, but only to follow the general rule that when in their actual operation in the cases before it, such statutes work an arbitrary, unequal, and oppressive result for \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 45]\n\u00a0\n the carrier which shocks the sense of fairness the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to satisfy in respect of state legislation, they will not be sustained.\n Coming now to the case before us, we find that the statute affects all common carriers, that it imposes on them the duty of considering and settling claims for loss of and damage to freight within 60 days, and provides that if they do not so settle them and in a subsequent suit more is recovered than the amount tendered, the amount found due shall carry 7 per cent. interest from the presentation of the claim as a penalty and reasonable attorney's fees. It an appeal be taken and the plaintiff succeed, an additional attorney's fee may be included. The statute is confined to freight claims. It does not place a limit on them, but as we have seen, the cases do not require this. The statute does require a tender but in this case the claims were wholly rejected. No tender of any amount was even attempted. The claims numbered 105 when presented and sued on. They were reduced to 72. The trial lasted four days.\n It is said here as it was said in the Polt Case, in \n232 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 301, that the company cannot be subjected to a penalty for not guessing rightly the verdict of a jury. But the cases are very different. There the penalty was double damages for a failure to guess rightly as to the jury's view of damages from a fire to a house when the extent of the damage was not peculiarly within the company's knowledge. Here the damages were for hogs injured during the custody of the carrier and whose value was determined by weight and market price and not difficult of ascertainment after a bona fide effort and there was no effort at a tender at all. Here the penalty is only 7 per cent. interest on the actual recovery and reasonable attorney's fees as costs. The amount of the attorney's fee $200 for a case involving the preparation for trial of 72 different claims and a four-day trial does not stock one's sense of fairness. \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 46]\n\u00a0\n It is further separately assigned for error that the Supreme Court imposed upon plaintiff in error an attorney's fee of $100 when it won the case on appeal by reducing the amount recovered in the trial court. The original section 6063, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, only provided for an attorney's fee to be fixed by the court, but chapter 134, Laws of Nebraska 1919, added the words, 'and in the event an appeal be taken and the plaintiff shall succeed, such plaintiff shall be entitled to recover an additional attorney fee to be fixed by such court or courts.' This might have been construed to mean that the plaintiff could only have an attorney's fee in the appellate court or courts, if he maintained the judgment he had obtained in the court of first instance. But the Supreme Court of the state, and that controls our view, has evidently interpreted the words 'the plaintiff shall succeed' to mean success in securing a judgment for more than the amount tendered, if any, and it is in light of this interpretation that we must consider the reasonableness of the statute and the validity of the fee fixed in this case.\n The evident theory of the amendment of section 6063, as thus interpreted, is that the burden of the litigation both in the trial and appellate court could be avoided by reasonable assiduity of the defendant carrier in availing itself of its peculiar sources of knowledge, ascertaining the actual damage and making a genuine tender of what it believes to be due, and if the ultimate recovery is not more than the tender, that the claimant shall have neither interest nor attorney's fee. Under the circumstances, does the statute thus construed work a fair result? Here is an excessive claim of $2,000 reduced to $800 by a trial in one court, with an attorney's fee fixed at $600, and then an appeal by which the claim is reduced to $600, and the fee to $200. It is said that there were 105 claims, reduced by the litigation to 72, and that claimant might have brought a separate suit on each, and so had an attorney's \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 47]\n\u00a0\n fee in each claim on which it recovered anything, making a larger aggregate of fees than it has secured. But we do not think this consideration can play any part in the case as it is. The complainant doubtless united the claims for its own convenience and to save its own time and that of its counsel.\n Then it is said the fee in the Supreme Court is left to the discretion of that court, which can be trusted to do the fair thing, as a chancellor often does, by dividing the costs on an equitable basis. But the difficulty with this view is that the construction which the Supreme Court has given the statute does not reserve to itself this power. It says that in such a statute the fee must be reasonable in that it is to be based on a consideration of the value of the attorney's service to the claimant and the amount of time and labor expended by him, bearing a fair proportion to the amount of the judgment recovered. These are the usual and proper elements in fixing compensation for a lawyer's service. In other words, the Supreme Court, if any amount over the tender is recovered by its judgment, must fix a fee compensating the attorneys for the claimant for their work on the appeal, however excessive the recovery below and however much reduced on the appeal, if more than the original tender. Thus what we have here is a requirement that the carrier shall pay the attorneys of the claimant full compensation for their labors in resisting its successful effort on appeal to reduce an unjust and excessive claim against it. This we do not think is fair play. Penalties imposed on one party for the privilege of appeal to the courts, deterring him from vindication of his rights, have been held invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Tucker, \n230 U.S. 340\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 961. While the present case does not involve any such penalties as were there imposed, we think the principle applies to the facts of this case. We hold that so much of the statute as imposed an attorney's \n\n[260 U.S. 35, 48]\n\u00a0\n fee upon the carrier in this case in the Supreme Court was invalid. The judgment of the Supreme Court is to this extent reversed and in other respects affirmed. The costs in this court will be taxed one-third to the defendant in error, and two-thirds to the plaintiff in error. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.I. & P. RY. CO. v. PERRY(1922)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 548, 549]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. O. Blake and W. R. Bleakmore, both of El Reno, Okl., John W. Willmott and R. J. Roberts, both of Wewoka, Okl., and T. P. Littlepage and Sidney F. Taliaferro, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Phil D. Brewer and Ed. S. Vaught, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error was sued out to test the validity, in view of the due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Service Letter Law of Oklahoma (Act April 24, 1908; Oklahoma Laws 1907-08, p. 516; Revised Laws Oklahoma 1910,  3769), applicable to public service corporations and the like, in a case that arose under the following circumstances.\n Daniel J. Perry, defendant in error, brought suit against Jacob M. Dickinson, then receiver of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company (the company itself afterwards was substituted in his place while the cause was pending in the Supreme Court of the state. Plaintiff alleged that while in the employ of the company, \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 550]\n\u00a0\n which operated a railway in Oklahoma and by which he had been employed continuously for a period of years, and while in the performance of his duties as switchman, he received severe personal injuries caused by a defect in a car brake, which either was known or in the exercise of due care by its employees would have become known to the railway company; the latter acknowledge responsibility for his injuries, settled with him through its claim agent on the basis of the company's negligence, furnished him with hospital treatment before and after the settlement, after some months dismissed him from the hospital as able to resume work, then refused to re-employ him on the ground that he was ineligible by reason of physical incapacity, and after he had unavailingly sought re- employment at intervals during two years, furnished him through its superintendent with a service letter certifying (correctly) that he had been employed upon the company's lines as switchman for a period named, and (contrary to the fact) that he had been dismissed on account of his responsibility in a case of personal injury to himself June 30, 1913, his service being otherwise satisfactory, and he averred that because of this letter he had been unable to secure employment, although competent, able, and willing.\n Defendant, besides a general denial, averred that the statute upon which the action was based was void, because it deprived defendant of the due process of law, and denied to it the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and also because it violated a section of the state Constitution in denying to defendant freedom of speech, including the right to remain silent. A trial by jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff, which on appeal was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Dickinson v. Perry, 75 Okl. 25, 181 Pac. 504.\n That court overruled the contention that the proof failed to show that the service letter given to plaintiff \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n did not truly state the cause of his discharge, then proceeded to discuss the constitutional questions, sustained the act, and affirmed the judgment.\n Defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error on the ground that the constitutionality of the act was not really at issue; that the trial judge's instructions to the jury show that the only substantial question was whether the statements made in the letter actually given by the defendant were false and derogatory, and whether plaintiff had suffered damage thereby. But since the court of last resort of the state actually dealt with and passed upon the question raised by plaintiff in error as to the validity of the statute upon the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and decided in favor of its validity, it is clear that, under the first paragraph of section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214), we have jurisdiction to pass upon the question, and the motion to dismiss must be denied. Miedreich v. Lauenstein, \n232 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 309; North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159.\n Again, in discussing the merits, defendant in error insists that the federal question is not necessarily involved; that the constitutional objection was waived when the company, instead of refusing to give a letter, of its own volition gave to Perry upon his dismissal a service letter which was false and derogatory, and which caused special damage that was pleaded and proved. At first blush, it seems somewhat strange for the company to aver that it acted under compulsion of a void statute, when what it did was contrary to the command of the statute; it almost looks as if it were merely held in damages for what ordinarily might be called a libel. But the case cannot properly be dealt with upon this ground. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma, not only passed upon the question of the constitutionality of the Service Letter Law, but deemed it \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n necessary to pass upon it. So far as can be gathered from its opinion, there was no other legal ground upon which the judgment could be supported. Apparently, under the law of Oklahoma apart from the statute, no legal duty was imposed upon the employer in such a case to speak the truth in a communication made respecting a discharged employee, nor was there other ground of liability for damages in case of its falsity. The statute is the essential foundation upon which the judgment rests, and we cannot find that the objections to its validity have been waived.\n The act (Oklahoma Laws 1907-08, p. 516; Revised Laws Oklahoma 1910,  3769) reads as follows:\n'3769. Corporation to Give Letter to Employee Leaving Service. Whenever any employee of any public service corporation, or of a contractor, who works for such corporation, doing business in this state, shall be discharged or voluntarily quits the service of such employer, it shall be the duty of the superintendent or manager, or contractor, upon request of such employee, to issue to such employee a letter setting forth the nature of the service rendered by such employee to such corporation or contractor and the duration thereof, and truly stating the cause for which such employee was discharged from or quit such service; and, if any such superintendent, manager or contractor shall fail or refuse to issue such letter to such employee, when so requested, or shall willfully or negligently refuse or fail to state the facts correctly, such superintendent, manager or contractor shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars and not more than five hundred dollars, and by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not less than one month and not exceeding one year: Provided, that such letter shall be written, in its entirety, upon a plain sheet of white paper to be selected by such employee. \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n No printed blank shall be used, and if such letter be written upon a typewriter, it shall be signed with pen and black ink and immediately beneath such signature shall be affixed the official stamp, or seal, of said superintendent, manager or other officer of such corporation or contractor, in an upright position. There shall be no figures, words or letters used, upon such piece of paper, except such as are plaintly essential, either in the date line, address, the body of the letter or the signature and seal or stamp thereafter, and no such letter shall have any picture, imprint, character, design, device, impression or mark, either in the body thereof or upon the face or back thereof, and any person of whom such letter is required who fails to comply with the foregoing requirements shall be liable to the penalties above prescribed.'\n\n The Supreme Court (75 Okl. 31, 181 Pac. 510), after stating, on familiar grounds, that the Legislature itself was the judge of the conditions which warranted legislative enactments, and laws were only to be set aside when they involved such palpable abuse of power and lack of reasonableness to accomplish a lawful end that they might be said to be merely arbitrary and capricious, and hence out of place in a government of laws and not of men, went on to say:\n'Whether or not the custom still prevails, it appears that at one time it was the rule among railway companies and other corporations to keep a list of employees who were discharged or left the service and to furnish such list to other railway companies and employers. Any reason which might be agreed among employers was sufficient for 'blacklisting' employees, thereby possibly preventing their again securing employment in their accustomed occupation or trade. It was this abuse, among other things, which caused the Legislatures of various states to enact laws declaring blacklisting unlawful, and requiring corporations to give a letter to employees discharged or leaving the service, setting forth the reasons \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n for the discharge of the employee or of his leaving the service and the nature of the service rendered by the employee.' 75 Okl. 32, 181 Pac. 510. 'The idea of requiring employers to give employees leaving their service a letter showing the character of work performed while in their service is not a new one. The common law recognized a moral obligation resting upon the employers to give a 'character' to servants leaving the employment of their masters, but no legal obligation of this nature existed until laws touching these matters were enacted.' 75 Okl. 33, 181 Pac. 511.\n\n'There is nothing in the law contested which attempts to prevent a corporation from hiring whomsoever it pleases, or from discharging its employees when it sees fit. Neither is there anything in the law which requires a corporation to give a letter of recommendation to employees discharged or leaving its service. All that is required is a statement of the employer showing the character of services rendered by the employee and the reason for his leaving the service of his employer. It is a certificate which, when the facts are favorable to the employee, may assist him in securing other work along the line of his trade, and is a certificate to which he feels that in justice he is entitled. ... There is nothing unusual or revolutionary in requiring the employer to give a certificate to the employee leaving his service showing the time he has been employed and the character of service rendered. ... The employee who perhaps has devoted years of his life to a particular trade, when relinquishing employment, is without evidence to present in another locality or to another employer unless he has some certificate showing the term and character of his previous employment.'\n\n The court proceeded to say that the legislation was a warranted and lawful exercise of the police power of the state; that the contention that it involved a private and not a public matter, in that only the individual employee and the individual employer were concerned, was a pure \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n assumption that failed to recognize existing conditions; that the welfare of employees affected that of entire communities and the whole public. The decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri in Cheek v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 192 S. W. 387, 392, L. R. A. 1918A, 166, affirmed this day in our No. 149, \n259 U.S. 530\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 516, 66 L. Ed. --, was cited with approval, and the statute attacked held not to deny to defendant due process of law nor to constitute an illegal infringement upon the right of contract.\n The contention that the statute was a denial and abridgment of the right of free speech was overruled, upon the ground that the right did not exist under the state Constitution in the absolute form in which it was asserted. The decisions by the Supreme Courts of Georgia, Kansas, and Texas in Wallace v. Georgia C. & N. Ry. Co., 94 Ga. 732, 22 S. E. 579, Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. Brown, 80 Kan. 312, 102 Pac. 459, 23 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 247, 133 Am. St. Rep. 213, 18 Ann. Cas. 346, and St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Griffin, 106 Tex. 477, 171 S. W. 703, L. R. A. 1917B, 1108, were disapproved.\n Except for the particular requirements contained in the proviso, the statute here in question does not differ substantially from the Missouri statute this day sustained in Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Cheek, No. 149, and may be sustained as against the contention that it is inconsistent with the guaranty of 'due process of law,' for the reasons set forth in the opinion in that case.\n The proviso requires that the service letter shall be written entirely upon a plain sheet of white paper to be selected by the employee, no printed blank to be used, and the letter, if written upon typewriter, to be signed with pen and black ink, and immediately beneath the signature an official stamp or seal to be affixed in an upright position. No figures, words, or letters to be used, except such as are plainly essential, either in the date line, the address, the body of the letter, or the signature and seal or stamp, and no picture, imprint, character, design, device, impression, or mark to be either in the body or upon the face or back of the letter. Manifestly these \n\n[259 U.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n provisions are designed to insure the authenticity of the document to prevent fabrication and alteration, and to make sure that it shall not only be fair and plain upon its face, but shall exclude any cryptic meaning. They are contrived to prevent the purpose of the act from being set at naught by the giving of fraudulent service letters, which, while bearing one meaning to the employee, might bear another and very different one to the prospective employer, to whom they might be presented. The act being valid in its main purpose, these provisions, intended to carry it into effect, must be sustained. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 570\n, 31 S. Sup.

S.) 44.\n The contention that the Service Letter Law denies to plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws is rested upon the fact that it is made to apply to public service corporations (and contractors working for them), to the exclusion of other corporations, individuals, and partnerships said to employ labor under similar circumstances. This is described as arbitrary classification. We are not advised of the precise reasons why the Legislature chose to put the policy of this statute into effect as to public service corporations, without going further; nor is it worth while to inquire. It may have been that the public had a greater interest in the personnel of the public service corporations, or that the Legislature deemed it expedient to begin with them as an experiment, or any one of a number of other reasons. It was peculiarly a matter for the Legislature to decide, and not the least substantial ground is present for believing they acted arbitrarily. We feel safe in relying upon the general presumption that they 'knew what they were about.' Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 \nU.S. 152, 157\n, 158 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 227, 229 (63 L.

JACKSON(1922)\nNo. 141\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 309, 310]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nathan Matthews and J. P. Lyons, both of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 309, 311]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Weston Allen, Edwin H. Abbot, Jr., and Alexander Lincoln, all of Boston, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to a decree of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts sustaining a demurrer to a bill in equity against the treasurer and receiver general of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Boston Elevated Railway Company, and the trustees who are operating the railway of that company under a special statute of the commonwealth (Sp. St. 1918, c. 159), and dismissing the bill for want of equity, the plaintiff not wishing to plead further. It now comes before us on a motion by the Attorney General of Massachusetts to dismiss or affirm.\n The case as made by the bill is an impeachment of the validity of the special act of 1918. By acts of 1902 and 1911 (Stat. 1902, c. 534, and Stat. 1911, c. 741), the city of Boston was given power to construct and did construct subways and tunnels at a cost of $31,000,000, and by the same authority leased these and also others built by it under earlier statute to the Boston Elevated Railway Company for a fixed rental until July 1, 1936, and the whole property and its rents and profits are by the express terms of the statute held by the city 'in its private or proprietary capacity, for its own property,' never to be taken by the commonwealth except upon payment of just compensation. The railway company got into financial difficulty. It served the residents of Boston and other towns of the commonwealth. The General Court in the public interest passed the special act of 1918 to relieve the situation. In general the act provided for the appointment \n\n[260 U.S. 309, 312]\n\u00a0\n of trustees who were to take the railway out of the hand of the company and operate it under the leases to the company by the city of Boston, on condition that the stockholders of the railway company accepted the provisions of the act. It is not necessary to set out what these provisions in detail are, except to say that they provide for the payment of dividends on the stock of the company, the repair and maintenance of the railway, the raising of $3,000,000 by the company for the improvement of the property and a reserve fund, and the payment of any deficit in operation out of the treasury of the commonwealth. If the commonwealth is called upon to make payments, to meet deficits or diminution of the reserve fund, such amounts are to be assessed upon the several cities and towns in which the railway operates, as an addition to the regular state tax, in proportion to the number of persons in said cities and towns using the service of the company at the time of the payments as determined by the trustees. The trustees are to fix the fares to meet the cost of service, including taxes, rentals and interest on the indebtedness of the company, fixed dividends on the preferred stock, and 5 per cent. on the common stock for two years, 5 1\/2 per cent. for the next two years and 6 per cent. for the remainder of public operation, which is for a period of ten years and thereafter as the commonwealth shall determine.\n The company's stockholders having accepted the act, the trustees took over the possession and operation of the railway. They found the railway in bad repair and charged $2,000,000 for depreciation and $2,300,000 for maintenance and repair in the year 1919. This led to a deficit for that year of $4,000,000, although in previous years the company had not expended more than $100,000 a year on such account. The treasurer and receiver general under the act of 1918 paid the deficit out of the treasury of the commonwealth, and was about to include \n\n[260 U.S. 309, 313]\n\u00a0\n the same in the state taxes to be collected by the city of Boston and the other towns through which the railway runs in the proportion fixed by the act. The object of the bill was to prevent this levy and collection and further proceedings under the act.\n The motion to dismiss is urged first on the ground that Charles L. Burrill as treasurer and receiver general was the defendant in the original bill and that the present defendant Jackson, his successor in office, has been substituted without legal sanction. The substitution took place in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts before that court considered the case on its merits and in the court's opinion the objection to the substitution was noted and overruled. This settles conclusively so far as we are concerned, that the state law authorized the substitution. The case of Irwin v. Webb, \n258 U.S. 219\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 293, decided by this court March 20, 1922, has no application. That was an appeal from a federal District Court in which this court had to consider the substitution in this court of county officers newly elected for those in office when the suit was brought and the decree entered in the District Court. It was not authorized by the federal statute and we could find no state law which permitted it to be done.\n The second ground urged for dismissal is that the tax for 1919 sought to be enjoined, has been collected from the taxpayers of the city by the city and paid over to the treasurer of the commonwealth so that the case here becomes a moot one. But the tax had been paid before the Supreme Judicial Court took up, considered and decided the case. It must, therefore, have found, as it was entirely justified in doing, that the bill in its averments, prayer and real object was directed not only against the collection of the tax then pending but against future payments out of the treasury of the commonwealth and against the continued operation by the trustees under the statute of 1918 with the possible incurring \n\n[260 U.S. 309, 314]\n\u00a0\n of future deficits to be assessed against the city for collection. The action of the state court upon such a matter relieves us from its consideration. BiMetallic Co. v. State Board of Equalization, \n239 \nU.S. 441, 444\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 141.\n Having disposed thus of the grounds presented for dismissing the writ of error, we come to the alternative prayer for affirmance. Under paragraph 5 of rule 6 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. vi), when the questions presented on such a motion are found by the court, in view of our previous decisions, to be so wanting in substance as not to need further argument, we dispose of the case.

Ct. 606.\n The plaintiff in error comes to this court because, as it says, the statute of 1918 of the commonwealth, by which the trustees took over and are now operating the railway, impairs the obligation of the contract of lease of its property in the tunnels and subways to the railway company, and so violates the contract clause of the federal Constitution. It further contends that the imposition of a tax merely to aid a private corporation, as in the act of 1918 complained of, is not for a public purpose, and taxes collected therefor from it is taking its property without due process of law. Thirdly, it avers that vesting power in the trustees to fix the deficit in operation of the railway and to assess the city for a large part thereof is also taking its property without due process of law.\n We are relieved from full or detailed consideration of these grounds urged for reversal by the satisfactory opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court in this case. Boston v. Treasurer and Receiver General, 237 Mass. 403, 130 N. E. 390.\n What the commonwealth did was to help the people of the towns which the railway served when the railway's finances threatened its collapse, by taking over the lease of the railway company for a valuable consideration. \n\n[260 U.S. 309, 315]\n\u00a0\n There was no restriction upon the power of the railway company to assign the lease if the company had the corporate power and that, if it did not exist before, was supplied by the act itself. The law provided for keeping the property in good repair and the payment of the rentals due the city. There was nothing in the contract of assignment which in the slightest decree impaired the obligation of the company to the city under the lease. Indeed it secured the performance of those obligations.\n But it is said the contract was impaired because the act provided that any deficit incurred in the operation of the road under the assignment was to be paid out of the treasury of the commonwealth and finally was to be collected in large part from the city of Boston, and thus that though Boston was to receive its rental, it was required to pay a deficit in operation into which the rental must enter as an important factor. The effect, therefore, was to take away or impair its beneficial interest in the profits of the contract of lease and its property. To this the Supreme Court answered that this tax was not imposed on Boston in its proprietary capacity in which it built the subways and leased them. The taxes collected were state taxes to achieve a state purpose and Boston in its public and political character was a mere state tax agency for the collection. The taxpayers were to be called upon to bear the burden of the public purpose of the state in furnishing this important service of transportation in and between the communities in which they lived. If this was in accord with the state constitution and statutes, as we must and do find it to be from the well-reasoned opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court, we can not see that in any respect the levy of the tax for deficits impairs Boston's contract with the railway company.\n In disposing of this objection we have in effect disposed of those objections to the act of 1918 based on the Fourteenth \n\n[260 U.S. 309, 316]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. If the Constitution and laws of Massachusetts authorize the commonwealth to operate a railway company for the public benefit, there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent. Nor is there anything in it preventing the state from using the trustees as agents to operate the railway and in such operation to determine the needed expenditures to comply with the obligations of the lease or the requirements of adequate public service. This is delegating to proper agents the decision of a proper administrative policy in the management of a state enterprise and the ascertainment of facts peculiarly within their field of authorized action.\n In this conclusion, we assume as did the Supreme Judicial Court, that the state may confer on one of its subdivisions like a city or town the private proprietary capacity by which it may acquire contract or property rights protected by the federal Constitution against subsequent impairment by its creator the state. Mt. Hope Cemetery v. Boston, 158 Mass. 509, 33 N. E. 695, 35 Am. St. Rep. 515. We do not wish to be understood as accepting such assumption as an established rule. Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil Co., \n250 U.S. 394\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 526. All we now decide is that even if the city of Boston may invoke the contract clause of the federal Constitution to protect its rights under the lease as against infringing legislation by the commonwealth, the act of 1918 does not infringe.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF HOUSTON v. SOUTHWESTERN BELL TEL CO(1922)\nNo. 219\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 318, 319]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. J. Howard, Sewall Myer, and A. E. Amerman, all of Houston, Tex., for city of Houston.\n Messrs. C. M. Bracelen, of New York City, Nelson Phillips, Joseph D. Frank, David A. Frank, and W. H. Duls, all of Dallas, Tex., and N. T. Guernsey, of New York City, for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the court.\n These are cross-appeals in a suit to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance enacted by the city of Houston, Tex. (hereinafter referred to as the City), prescribing rates for telephone service, based upon the claim that the rates are confiscatory.\n The master, to whom the case was referred, found that the rates were clearly confiscatory, and the District Court, while modifying his findings in some respects, confirmed his report and in its decree enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance. A federal constitutional question being involved, a direct appeal brings the case to this court for review.\n The Constitution of Texas, adopted in 1876 (section 17, art. 1), provides:\n'No irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be made; but all privileges and franchises granted by the Legislature, or created under its authority, shall be subject to the control thereof.'\n\n It has been definitely decided that, while municipal corporations in Texas, as agencies of the state, may have the power to prescribe rates for public service corporations, this provision of the Constitution prohibits their making contracts for the future which may not be modified at any time by appropriate action of the municipality. \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n San Antonio Traction Co. v. Altgelt, \n200 U.S. 304\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 261; City of San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service Co., \n255 U.S. 547\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 428; Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. City of Chariton, Iowa, \n255 U.S. 539\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 400.\n The ordinance here involved was passed in 1909, and therefore this state of the law would remove all question of contract from the case, if it were not that in 1915 the appellee in No. 219 the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company), by purchase and merger acquired all of the property of a local corporation, the 'Houston Home Telephone Company,' and duly accepted an ordinance by which the City approved the merger. This ordinance contained the provision that the Company--\n'agrees that it will not increase rates as at present charged by it for service in the city of Houston, unless it appears upon a satisfactory showing ... that there exists a necessity for an increase of charges, in order that the said company may earn a fair return upon its capital actually invested in the Houston plant.'\n\n It is now contended by the City that the acceptance of this ordinance estops the Company from asserting that the value of its plant, as of the date of the inquiry, and not the cost of it-the 'capital actually invested'-shall be the basis for rate-making, but the Company contends that the quoted provision of the state Constitution rendered the City incapable of contracting by such an ordinance and that therefore it is void and not binding on either party.\n The master, treating the merger ordinance as void, determined the value of the property, used and useful in the operations of the Company, on the basis of its value at the time of the taking of the testimony in 1919, to be $6,000,000; that the Company's total revenues for 1919, computed on the ordinance rates, amounted to $908,258; and that its total expenses were $1,214,462, thus showing \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n a net loss to the Company for the year of $306,204, without making any allowance for interest upon the investment.\n Upon exceptions to the report of the master, the District Court decided that the Company was bound by the merger ordinance of 1915 to accept the cost of its plant, as distinguished from its value at the time of the inquiry, as the basis for rate-making, and thereupon reduced the valuation of the Company's property to $4,571,567. The court also reduced the allowance of 'reserve for annual depreciation,' as found by the master from $348,150 to $289,380. After making these and some other deductions the court, nevertheless, found that the operating expenses of the Company, not making any allowance for return on the investment, exceeded the income during 1919 by the sum of $247,434. We fully agree with the District Court that there is a clear preponderance of the evidence in favor of the conclusion that the ordinance rate was confiscatory, and the decree of the court will, therefore, be affirmed.\n The decree enjoining the City from enforcing the rate ordinance provides that the City shall have the right to apply for a modification of it whenever it shall be made to appear that, by reason of change of circumstances or conditions, the rates prescribed by the ordinance (of 1909) are sufficient to yield a fair return upon the capital of the Company actually invested, and also that the decree is without prejudice to the rights of the City to exercise its rate-making power within constitutional limits. This form of decree and the change in business conditions since it was entered render it so probable that there will be further controversy as to what are reasonable rates for telephone service in the City, in which it will be important to determine what the legal basis is for determining the value of the Company's property, that we think it proper to consider several of the assignments of error presented \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n by the appeal and cross-appeal, although our conclusions with respect to them will not modify the result we have stated of this review.\n While the City's assignments of error are numerous, in the brief they are frankly limited to three:\n First: That the division of receipts derived by the Company from long- distance tolls, approved by the court, was not a fair or adequate one.\n The Company not only operated the Houston local exchange but it owned and operated long-distance toll lines, connecting the local exchange with various towns and cities in Texas and several other states. The property used in the long-distance service, which was not also used in the local service, was not included in valuing the investment for determining local rates, but, as the local lines were used to the extent of permitting a subscriber to connect from his home or office station with the long- distance lines through the long-distance station, the Company, in practice, and for the purposes of this suit, credited the local exchange with 25 per cent. of the long-distance toll revenues received from calls originating in Houston as compensation for the use made of the local plant in rendering long-distance service. The City contends that this allowance is not enough but that it should be at least 60 per cent. Both the court and the master found: that the proportion so credited from long-distance tolls was greater than that allowed to any one of eight independent exchanges in the state of Texas by independent long-distance toll lines with which they were connected; that the amount is larger than that paid by the Company to over 300 independent exchanges with which it has like connections; and that the allowance is one customarily approved by state commissions throughout the country. Compared with the formidable and very convincing evidence on which these conclusions rest, the testimony introduced by the City is meager and unsatisfactory, and we agree \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n with the District Court that upon the record before us the allowance was reasonably sufficient.\n Second and third: The American Telegraph & Telephone Company owns substantially all of the stock of the Company and a large majority of the stock of the Western Electric Company. From the American Telegraph & Telephone Company the Company leases its instruments and secures their maintenance and renewal and from the Western Electric Company it obtains the greater part of its equipment and supplies used in operating its local exchange. It is contended by the City that no fair disclosure was made of the profits made by the furnishing companies on the instruments and on the material and supplies so furnished, and that, for this unique reason, the Company should not be heard in a court of equity and the case should be dismissed. It is true that the Company did not introduce proof to show what the profits of the two companies were, either upon the business done with it or on their entire business but it did introduce much evidence tending to show that the charge made and allowed for the services rendered and supplies furnished by them was reasonable and less than the same could be obtained for from other sources. Under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, the fact that the American Telegraph & Telephone Company controlled the Company and the Western Electric Company by stock ownership is not important beyond requiring close scrutiny of their dealings to prevent imposition upon the community served by the Company, but the court recognized and applied this rule. Here, again, the evidence introduced by the City was meager and indefinite, while that of the Company was exceptionally full and complete, and both contentions must be denied.\n In its cross-appeal the Company assigns as error, the holding of the District Court that the merger ordinance of \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n 1915 obliges the Company to accept the cost of its physical plant as the basis for rate-making, instead of the usual basis, the value, at the time of the inquiry, of the property used and useful in operating the plant. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 52\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 192, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; City & County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 278. The asserted reason for this contention is that the merger ordinance of 1915 and the acceptance of it by the Company did not constitute a contract binding upon either the City or the Company, but that, though contractual in form, it was void under the provisions of the state Constitution and the decisions cited, supra. In its answer the City avers that it did not and could not, by that ordinance or otherwise, limit its rate-making power for the future. But, notwithstanding this agreement of the parties that the merger ordinance was void, the court held that the Company, having accepted and acted upon it, was estopped to claim that it was not bound by its terms. Misrepresentation not being involved, mutuality was necessary to any estoppel growing out of this transaction, and while thus asserting that the ordinance is void as to itself the City may not successfully assert that its adversary is bound by the acceptance of it. We think that neither party was bound by the ordinance and the acceptance of it, that the District Court fell into error, and that the proper base for rate-making in the case is the fair value of the property, useful and used by the Company, at the time of the inquiry.\n The master recognized 'going concern value' as an element to be taken into consideration in determining the value of the Company's property and for this allowed $765,000, which was included in the value which he fixed upon the plant. The court, however, changing the base from the value of the property to the cost of it, concluded that under the agreement in the merger ordinance no such allowance should be made, but stated, incidentally, in \n\n[259 U.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n its opinion, that if it had made such an allowance it would not have been in excess of one-half the amount allowed by the master. To thus reject going concern value is assigned as error by the Company.\n Whether going concern value should be considered and allowed at all in determining the base for rate-making, and if allowed what the amount of it should be, depends upon the financial history of the Company (Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston et al., \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351, 66 L. Ed. --, decided April 10th), and it is impossible for us to determine whether the requisite history for deciding this question is to be found in the three large volumes of the transcript of the record of the case containing 1664 pages, without reading the whole of it.\n Equity rule No. 75 (33 Sup. Ct. xl) provides that evidence to be included in the record shall not be set forth in full but shall be stated in a simple and condensed form, and rule 21 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. x) provides that briefs of the argument shall be filed in each case, with references to the pages of the record and the authorities relied upon in support of each point. The first of these rules has been wholly ignored in the printing of this record and the second has been so neglected in the preparation of the briefs that it is impossible for the court to consider this question except by itself reading and briefing the voluminous record. This we cannot consent to do, and for the reason that the record and briefs are not prepared in conformity with the rules prescribed by this court, we decline to consider this assignment of error.\n The other questions argued in the briefs must necessarily be presented so differently on any further hearing of the issues involved that discussion of them here would be profitless. The decree of the District Court must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLLINS v. LOISEL(1922)\nNo. 672\nArgued: April 28, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 309, 310]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Guion Miller and Edgar Allan Poe, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert H. Marr, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is the second appeal by Collins in this case. The first was dismissed in Collins v. Miller, \n252 U.S. 364\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 347, for want of jurisdiction. There the earlier proceedings and the nature of the controversy are fully set forth. After our decision the case was again heard by the District Court, \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 311]\n\u00a0\n on the same record and the same evidence, and on October 25, 1921, judgment was entered. By that judgment the writ of habeas corpus was granted, so far as the commitment was based on charges of obtaining property by false pretenses from Pohoomull Bros. and from Ganeshi Lall & Sons, and as to these commitments the court discharged Collins. But as to the commitment based on the charge of obtaining property by false pretenses from Mahomed Ali Zaimal Ali Raza the court dismissed the application for habeas corpus and remanded Collins to the custody of Loisel, the marshal. The British consul general acquiesced in this judgment. Collins appealed from so much thereof as recommitted him to the custody of the marshal. As the judgment below was final and disposed of the whole case, we now have jurisdiction. It is insisted, on several grounds, that the committing magistrate was without jurisdiction, and that consequently the appellant should have been discharged.\n First. Collins contends that the affidavit of the British consul general does not charge an extraditable offense. The argument is that the affidavit charges cheating merely; that cheating is not among the offenses enumerated in the extradition treaties; that cheating is a different offense from obtaining property under false pretenses, which is expressly named in the treaty of December 13, 1900 (32 Stat. 1864); that to convict of cheating it is sufficient to prove a promise of future performance which the promisor does not intend to perform, while to convict of obtaining property by false pretense it is essential that there be a false representation of a state of things past or present. See State v. Colly, 39 La. Ann. 841, 2 South. 496. It is true that an offense is extraditable only if the acts charged are criminal by the laws of both countries. It is also true that the charge made in the court of India rests upon section 420 of its Penal Code, which declares:\n'Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person de ceived \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 312]\n\u00a0\n to deliver any property to any person ... shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine'1\n\n -whereas section 813 of the Revised Statutes of Louisiana declares:\n'Whoever, by any false pretense, shall obtain, or aid and assist another in obtaining, from any person, money or any property, with intent to defraud him of the same, he shall, on conviction, be punished by imprisonment at hard labor or otherwise, not exceeding twelve months.'\n\n But the affidavit of the British consul general recites that Collins stands charged in the Chief Presidency Magistrate's Court with having feloniously obtained the pearl button by false pretenses; and the certificate of the secretary to the government of India, which accompanies the papers on which Collins' surrender is sought, describes the offense with which he is there charged as 'the crime of obtaining valuable property by false pretenses.' The law does not require that the name by which the crime is described in the two countries shall be the same; nor that the scope of the liability shall be coextensive, or, in other respects, the same in the two countries. It is enough if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions. This was held with reference to different crimes involving false statements in Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 58\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 781; Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 14\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 487; Benson v. McMahon, \n127 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1240; and Greene v. United States, 154 Fed. 401, 85 C. C. A. 251. Compare Ex parte Piot, 15 Cox, C. C. 208. The offense charged was, therefore, clearly extraditable.\n Second. Collins contends that the evidence introduced was wholly inadmissible. That particularly objected to \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 313]\n\u00a0\n on this ground is the warrant of arrest and copies of prima facie proceedings in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, which accompanied the affidavit of the British consul general. The consul general for the United States in Calcutta had certified that these papers proposed to be used upon an application for the extradition of Collins 'charged with the crime of obtaining valuable property by false pretenses alleged to have been committed in Bombay' were 'properly and legally authenticated, so as to entitle them to be received in evidence for similar purposes by the tribunals of British India, as required by the Act of Congress of August 3, 1882.' That act (chapter 378,  5, 22 Stat. 215, 216 [Comp. St.  10116]), declares that 'depositions, warrants, and other papers, or the copies thereof' so authenticated, shall be received and admitted as evidence for all purposes on hearings of an extradition case if they bear 'the certificate of the principal diplomatic or consular officer of the United States resident in such foreign country.' One argument of Collins is that the admissibility of evidence is determined, not by the above provision of the act of 1882, but by section 5271 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  10111), which provided only that copies of foreign depositions shall be admitted when 'attested upon the oath of the party producing them to be true copies,' and which did not provide for the admission of 'warrants or other papers,' and that, on these grounds, copies both of the Indian documents and of certain London depositions should have been excluded, since neither the consul general at Calcutta, the Secretary of the Embasst at London, nor the British consul general at New Orleans, could attest that the papers were true copies. But section 6 of the act of 1882 expressly provides for the repeal of so much of section 5271 as is inconsistent with earlier provisions of that act; and under section 5 thereof the admissibility of papers is not so restricted.\n Another argument of Collins is that the Indian documents were not \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 314]\n\u00a0\n properly authenticated, because they were certified to by the consul general at Calcutta, and not by the consul at Bombay, where the offense charged is alleged to have been committed. The 'foreign country' here in question is India, not Bombay; and we may, in this connection, take judicial notice of the fact that the consul general of the United States who is stationed at Calcutta is the principal diplomatic or consular officer resident in that country and who he is. Compare York & Amryland Line R. R. Co. v. Winans, 17 How. 30, 41; Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 \nU.S. 138, 146\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 290. The papers were, therefore, properly authenticated and were admissible. Compare In re Behrendt (C. C.) 22 Fed. 699; In re Charleston (D. C.) 34 Fed. 531; In re Orpen (C. C.) 86 Fed. 760.\n Third. Collins contends that the evidence introduced did not support the charge of obtaining property by false pretenses. The papers introduced tended to prove that Collins obtained the pearl button from the jewelers as a result of his representing that he was a wealthy man; that he was a partner in William Collins & Sons Company of Glasgow and London; that he was a colonel in the Howe Battalion of the Royal Naval Division and was then on six months' leave; that he had a right to draw on Messrs. E. Curtice & Co., 8 Clarges street, London, the draft of 1,700 which he gave the jewelers; and that this was a firm of bankers. The papers tended to prove also that all these representations were false to Collins' knowledge. It is clear that evidence to this effect, if competent and believed, would justify a conviction not only for cheating, but also of obtaining property under false pretenses. State v. Tessier, 32 La. Ann. 1227; State v. Jordan, 34 La. Ann. 1219; State v. Will, 49 La. Ann. 1337, 22 South. 378; State v. Seipel, 104 La. 67, 28 South. 880. The contention of Collins is that the evidence established only a broken promise or, at most, commonlaw cheating. It was not the function of the committing magistrate to determine whether Collins was guilty, but \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 315]\n\u00a0\n merely whether there was competent legal evidence which, according to the law of Louisiana, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime had been committed in that state. Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 456\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397. If there was such evidence this court has no power to review his finding. Ornelas v. Ruiez, \n161 \nU.S. 502, 508\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 689; Terlinden v. Ames, \n184 \nU.S. 270, 278\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 484; McNamara v. Henkel, \n226 U.S. 520\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 146. The papers tended to establish more than a broken promise or common-law cheating, and according to the law of Louisiana they furnished 'such reasonable ground to suppose him guilty as to make it proper that he should be tried.' See Glucksman v. Henkel, \n221 \nU.S. 508, 512\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 704, 705 (55 L. Ed. 830).\n Fourth. Finally Collins contends that the evidence of criminality was not such as under the law of Louisiana would have justified his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been committed there. The argument is that by the law of Louisiana a person charged with having committed an offense is entitled to make a voluntary declaration before the committing magistrate and also to present evidence in his own behalf (Revised Statutes 1870,  1010; Laws 1886, act 45); that this right to introduce such evidence is, therefore, secured to a prisoner by the treaty;2 and that this requirement as to evidence of criminality was not complied with, because Collins was not permitted to introduce evidence in his own behalf.\n Collins was allowed to testify, and it was clearly the purpose of the committing magistrate to permit him to testify fully, to things which might have explained ambiguities or doubtful elements in the prima facie case \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 316]\n\u00a0\n made against him. In other words, he was permitted to introduce evidence bearing upon the issue of probable cause. The evidence excluded related strictly to the defense. It is clear that the mere wrongful exclusion of specific pieces of evidence, however important, does not render the detention illegal. Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 461\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397. The function of the committing magistrate is to determine whether there is competent evidence to justify holding the accused to await trial, and not to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to justify a conviction. Grin v. Shine, \n187 \nU.S. 181, 197\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 98; Benson v. McMahon, \n127 \nU.S. 457, 461\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1240; Ex parte Glaser, 176 Fed. 702, 704, 100 C. C. A. 254. In Re Wadge (D. C.) 15 Fed. 864, 866, cited with approval in Charlton v. Kelly, supra, 229, U. S. 461, 33 Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397, the right to introduce evidence in defense was claimed; but Judge Brown said:\n'If this were recognized as the legal right of the accused in extradition proceedings, it would give him the option of insisting upon a full hearing and trial of his case here; and that might compel the demanding government to produce all its evidence here, both direct and rebutting, in order to meet the defense thus gathered from every quarter. The result would be that the foreign government, though entitled by the terms of the treaty to the extradition of the accused for the purpose of a trial where the crime was committed, would be compelled to go into a full trial on the merits in a foreign country, under all the disadvantages of such a situation, and could not obtain extradition until after it had procured a conviction of the accused upon a full and substantial trial here. This would be in plain contravention of the intent and meaning of the extradition treaties.'\n\n The distinction between evidence properly admitted in behalf of the defendant and that improperly admitted is drawn in Charlton v. Kelly, supra, between evidence rebutting probable cause and evidence in defense. The court there said:\n'To have witnesses produced to contradict the testimony for the prosecution is \n\n[259 U.S. 309, 317]\n\u00a0\n obviously a very diferent thing from hearing witnesses for the purpose of explaining matters referred to by the witnesses for the government.'\n\n And in that case evidence of insanity was declared inadmissible as going to defense and not to probable cause. Whether evidence offered on an issue before the committing magistrate is relevant is a matter which the law leaves to his determination, unless his action is so clearly unjustified as to amount to a denial of the hearing prescribed by law.\n The phrase 'such evidence of criminality,' as used in the treaty, refers to the scope of the evidence or its sufficiency to block out those elements essential to a conviction. It does not refer to the character of specific instruments of evidence or to the rules governing admissibility. Thus, unsworn statements of absent witnesses may be acted upon by the committing magistrate, although they could not have been received by him under the law of the state on a preliminary examination. Elias v. Ramirez, \n215 U.S. 398\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 131; Rice v. Ames, \n180 U.S. 371\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 406. And whether there is a variance between the evidence and the complaint is to be decided by the general law and not by that of the state. Glucksman v. Henkel, \n221 \nU.S. 508, 513\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 704. Here the evidence introduced was clearly sufficient to block out those elements essential to a conviction under the laws of Louisiana of the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses. The law of Louisiana could not, and does not attempt to, require more. It is true that the procedure to be followed in hearings on commitment is determined by the law of the state in which they are held. In re Farez, 7 Blatchf. 345, Fed. Cas.

MCDONALD(1922)\nNo. 150\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 416, 417]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. D. Collins, of San Francisco, Cal., pro se.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Blackburn Esterline, both of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In February, 1920, Roy Marshall, a private in the United States Army, serving at Vladivostok, Siberia, was tried for robbery by a court martial there convened, was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary at McNeil's Island.\n Seven months later, when Marshall was at the Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz Island, awaiting transportation to McNeil's Island, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in his behalf by his attorney, G. D. Collins, in the District Court for the Northern District of California.\n In response to a rule to show cause why the writ should not be issued, Col. J. D. McDonald, Commandant of the Disciplinary Barracks, filed a demurrer to the petition on two grounds: (1) That the petition did not state facts sufficient to entitle petitioner to the writ; and (2) that the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition. \n\n[258 U.S. 416, 418]\n\u00a0\n This demurrer was sustained, without opinion, and the case is here for review on direct appeal from the District Court, based on sufficient constitutional grounds.\n If the District Court had issued the writ as prayed for, the only questions it would have been competent for it to hear and determine would have been:\n'Did the court-martial which tried and condemned the prisoner have jurisdiction, of his person, and of the offense charged, and was the sentence imposed within the scope of its lawful powers?'\n\n'The single inquiry, the test, is jurisdiction. That being established, the habeas corpus must be denied and the petitioner remanded. That wanting, it must be sustained and the petitioner discharged.'

McClaughry v. Deming, \n186 \nU.S. 49, 62\n, 63 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 786; Givens v. Zerbst, \n255 \nU.S. 11, 19\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 227.\n Thus, the question for decision here is: Does the petition show want of jurisdiction in the court-martial over the person of the accused and over the offense with which he was charged and for which he was sentenced?\n Neither the constitution, the convening, nor the regularity of the proceedings, of the court-martial in this case, is assailed, and that the prisoner was a private in the Army of the United States is admitted. The only allegation in the petition of sufficient substance to deserve notice is that the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction in the court to render it, because the specifications do not charge any crime known to the laws of the United States, in that it does not appear therein that the property alleged to have been taken was not the property of \n\n[258 U.S. 416, 419]\n\u00a0\n the accused, and also because it is not averred therein that the property was in the care, possession, and custody or control of the person from whose possession it is alleged to have been taken.\n The only part of the charge appearing in the petition is a copy of three specifications, the first of which reads:\n'Specification 1: In that Private Roy W. Marshall, Company K, 31st Infantry, Private Gilbert Frey, Company K, 31st Infantry, Private Gerald E. Troxler, Company K, 31st Infantry, and Private James F. Hyde, Company K, 31st Infantry, acting jointly and in pursuance of a common intent, did, at Vladivostok, Siberia, on or about the 14th day of January, 1920, by putting him in fear, feloniously take from the presence of Van Fun Un, 40 Koreaskays street, Vladivostok, Siberia, the sum of about ten thousand (10,000) roubles, value about fifty dollars ($50.00).'\n\n The second and third specifications differ from the first only in the name and place of residence in Vladivostok of the person robbed and as to the value of the property taken.\n The argument in support of the contention of the petitioner is that the allegation that the property was taken 'from the presence of' the persons named does not imply that it was taken unlawfully from the presence, possession or custody of another or that it was not at the time the property of the accused.\n The jurisdiction of the court-martial was derived from the act of Congress embodying the Articles of War, which it is declared, shall, at all times and in all places, govern the armies of the United States (39 Stat. 650, 670), and the charge of robbery was certainly framed under article 93 thereof (Comp. St.  2308a) providing that:\n'Any person subject to military law who commits ... robbery ... shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.' \n\n[258 U.S. 416, 420]\n\u00a0\n The sufficient answer to this contention that the specifications do not charge any crime known to the laws of the United States is that section 284 of the federal Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10457), providing for the punishment of robbery, reads:\n\n'Whoever, by force and violence, or by putting in fear, shall feloniously take from the person or presence of another anything of value, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.'\n\n This has been accepted as an accurate and authoritative definition of robbery from Blackstone, book IV, p. 243 (Cooley's Edition) to Bishop's New Criminal Law, vol. II,  1177, 1178. Taking property from the presence of another feloniously and by putting him in fear is equivalent to taking it from his personal protection and is, in law, a taking from the person. Men do not feloniously put others in fear for the purpose of seizing their own property.\n It is not necessary that the charge in court-martial proceedings should be framed with the technical precision of a common law indictment and we cannot doubt that the one in this case clearly shows jurisdiction in the court over the accused and over the offense with which he was charged, and that the latter was sufficiently described to advise defendant of the time and place and circumstances under which it was claimed he had committed the crime, to enable him to make any defense he may have had.\n It is also charged that there was no evidence of guilt before the court-martial, other than the confession of the accused, which, it is averred, was made, under oath, to and at the instance of his superior officer, under duress, whereby it is alleged he was compelled to become a witness against himself in violation of the Constitution of the United States. This, in substance, is a conclusion of the pleader, unsupported by any reference to the record and, at most, was an error in the admission of testimony, \n\n[258 U.S. 416, 421]\n\u00a0\n which cannot be reviewed in a habeas corpus proceeding. Cases supra.\n The remaining allegations are trivial.\n For the reason that the petition did not state facts sufficient to entitle petitioner to the writ of habeas corpus, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONNORS v.

READING CO(1922)\nNo. 609\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n This case presents the questions, first, whether a decree of the District Court, entered under a mandate from this [ Continental Ins Co v. Reading Co \n259 U.S. 156\n (1922) ] \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n court in United States v. Reading Co. et al., \n253 U.S. 26\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 425, is in accordance therewith; and, second, whether it does equity to the appellants.\n The original suit was instituted by the United States to dissolve the relation existing between the Reading Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, all corporations of Pennsylvania, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, a corporation of New Jersey, and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, as a combination to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in anthracite coal, and to violate the commodities clause of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 585 (Comp. St.  8563, subd. 6).\n This court found that by a scheme of reorganization, adopted in December, 1895, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company combined to deliver into the complete control of the board of directors of a holding company, the Reading Company, all of the property of much the largest single coal company operating in the Schuylkill field, and almost 1,000 miles of railway over which its coal must find its access to interstate markets, and that this constituted a combination unduly to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in anthracite coal; that the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal Company had thereafter but one stockholder, the Reading Company; and that thus the Reading Company served to pool the property, the activities, and the profits of the three companies. The court further found that, through the acquisition by the Reading Company of a majority of the stock of the Jersey Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, which itself owned 90 per cent. of the stock in the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, the illegal power of the combination was greatly increased, and that the relation of common control through \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n stock ownership of the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal Company, and that of the Jersey Central Railroad Company and the Lehigh Valley & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company were violations of the commodities clause, requiring dissolution. The court, therefore, remanded the case to the District Court, directing a decree in conformity to the opinion dissolving the whole combination of the four companies with the Reading Company and such disposition of the shares of stocks and bonds and other property of the Reading Company as might be necessary to establish the entire independence of each company from the others, to the end that the affairs of all of them might be conducted in harmony with law.\n For convenience the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company will be called the Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company the Reading Coal Company, the Central Railroad of New Jersey the New Jersey R. R. Company, and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company.\n The situation, at the time the District Court was directed to enter its decree, was as follows: The Reading Company, the holding company, had a special charter under the laws of Pennsylvania granted prior to the adoption of the Constitution of that state of 1874, with unusually broad powers. It was not engaged directly in operating a railroad, and was not subject to regulation by federal or state authorities having jurisdiction over common carriers. It owned the entire capital stock of the Reading Railway Company, being $42,481,700, par value, and $20,000,000 of its bonds; $8,000,000, par value, being the entire capital stock of the Reading Coal Company; the real estate, rolling stock, and floating equipment used upon or in connection with the Reading Railway System; shares of stock and bonds of other railroads and terminal companies, constituting \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n a part of the Reading Railway System; $14,504,000, par value, being more than a majority, of the stock of the New Jersey R. R. Company, all of which was pledged except 40 shares, under a collateral trust mortgage to secure $23,000,000 worth of bonds. These were not all its holdings, but they are all that are important here.\n On January 5, 1897, the Reading Company and the Reading Coal Company jointly gave a mortgage to the Central, now the Central, Union Trust Company of New York, trustee, hereafter to be referred to as the general mortgage. The security under this mortgage was all the property of the Reading Coal Company and all of its capital stock, together with all of the capital stock of the Reading Railway Company and all the railroad equipment and certain real estate essential to the operation of the Reading Railway Company, which was held by the Reading Company, together with certain bonds of the Railway Company. The bonds now outstanding under this mortgage amount in round figures to $93,000,000.\n A combination of the Reading Railway Company and the Reading Coal Company had been maintained for years, and the property of the Reading Coal Company had been greatly enlarged by purchases and improvements, through money advanced by the Reading Railway Company, resulting in an indebtedness of the Reading Coal Company to the Reading Railway Company which ultimately amounted to about $70,000,000. In 1896, when the Reading Company became the holding company under the then formed combination, this indebtedness of the Coal Company to the Railway Company appeared as a credit on the books of the Reading Company, and a debit on the books of the Coal Company, but it is quite clear that they were mere bookkeeping entries and that it had been agreed that they should be canceled They are canceled in the proposed plan. \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n Under the plan embodied in the decree of the District Court, the Reading Company is, as between it and the Reading Coal Company, to assume the whole liability under the general mortgage, and agrees to save the Coal Company and its property harmless therefrom. The Reading Company is to receive from the Reading Coal Company $10,000,000 in cash or current assets, and $25,000,000 in 4 per cent. bonds of the Reading Coal Company, secured by mortgage on its properties its interest, subject to the lien of transfer its interest, subject to the lien of the general mortgage, in all the stock of the present Reading Coal Company, amounting to $8,000,000 in par value, but actually worth many times that amount, including the right to vote and receive dividends thereon, to a new Reading Coal Company, a corporation to be created under the supervision of the District Court, and over which that court is to retain control, so as to prevent its being used to thwart the decree.\n The new Coal Company agrees to issue as its total capital stock 1,400, 000 shares, without par value, to a trustee or trustees appointed by the District Court, who are to transfer to the Reading Company assignable certificates of interest in the stock of the new Coal Company, for distribution to its stockholders. The certificates are to be exchangeable for such stock only when accompanied by an affidavit, stating among other things that the holder is not an owner of any stock of the Reading Company, and is not acting for or on behalf of any stockholder of the Reading Company, or in concert, agreement, or understanding with any other person, firm, or corporation for the control of the coal company in the interest of the Reading Company, but in his own behalf in good faith.\n The certificates of interest are to be offered for so-called sale by the Reading Company to its stockholders, preferred and common, share and share alike, for $2 for each share of the Reading Company. Such stockholders \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n cannot, however, continue as stockholders of the Reading Company and become stockholders of the new Coal Company during the conversion period, but each must dispose of his certificates of interest in the new Coal Company or of his stock in the Reading Company. If, after July 1, 1924, any of the certificates shall remain outstanding, the court, in its discretion and after a hearing, may order the shares covered by such certificates to be sold, and the proceeds distributed to the owners of such certificates. The Attorney General is given access to the transfer books of both companies to enforce compliance with the order. This secures to the Reading Company in cash $5,600,000.\n Second. The Reading Company will merge into itself the Reading Railway Company and all the railway property of the Reading Railway Company is to be made subject to the direct lien of the general mortgage. The existing charter of the Reading Company authorizes such a merger. The Reading Company is to accept the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874, and to proceed under the Pennsylvania act of 1856 to surrender those of its franchises which are inappropriate for a railroad corporation of Pennsylvania. It will thus become a railway company, subject in all respects to the regulation of the state and federal authorities as a common carrier.\n Third. The Reading Company is to transfer to trustees appointed by the District Court, subject to the lien of the collateral trust mortgage already mentioned, all of its interest in the stock of the New Jersey R. R. Company. The final disposition of this stock is to be deferred in view of the possible groupings of railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456), but is to be subject to an order of sale by the court in its discretion before that time. The trustees are directed to select directors and secure a management of the New Jersey R. R. Company entirely independent of \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n the Reading Company, which shall discharge its duties under the supervision of the court.\n Fourth. The stock of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, held by the New Jersey Railroad Company is by the decree to be sold to persons not stockholders of the New Jersey Railroad Company, the Reading Company, the Reading Railroad Company, or the new Reading Coal Company, and who shall qualify as purchasers of the same by an affidavit like the one already mentioned. It appears that this provision of the decree has already been carried out, because not appealed from, and that the stock of the Wilkes- Barre Coal Company has been sold, though there is pending an application to set the sale aside.\n The appeals in this case were taken by the insurance companies, who own 8,400 shares of the common stock of the Reading Company, less than 1 per cent. of the entire common stock, and by the so-called Prosser committee, also interveners, who represent 407,728 shares of the common stock, which is somewhat less than 30 per cent. of the total common stock, and less than 15 per cent. of the entire capital stock of the Company. Their appeals are based on the claim that the right to subscribe for the certificates of interest in the stock of the new Coal Company belong to the common stockholders of the Reading Company and to them alone, to the exclusion of the preferred stockholders.\n After the first argument of these appeals, the court directed a second argument upon the questions (1) whether the plan adopted by the District Court was in conformity with this court's mandate, in establishing the entire independence of the companies found in unlawful combination from each other; (2) whether there was any legal or practical difficulty in selling the Reading Coal Company's stock free from the lien of the general mortgage; and (3) what was the basis of the adjustment of the indebtedness between the Reading Company and the new and old Reading Coal Companies. \n257 U.S. 622\n, 42 Sup.

C., on the brief), for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appeals which brought this case here were taken under the Act of Congress approved February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823 (Comp. St.  8824, 8825 ), as modified by section 291 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1268). Ordinarily the scope of our review of the decree of \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n the District Court would be limited to the assignments of error of the appellants, but in this case, as the decree which is before us was entered under a mandate of this court, we have jurisdiction to consider on our own motion whether our mandate has been complied with. We delegated to the District Court the duty of formulating a decree in compliance with the principles announced in our judgment of reversal, and that gives us plenary power, where the compliance has been attempted and the decree in any proper way is brought to our attention, to see that it follows our opinion.\n The plan of dissolution of the bond between the four companies under the control of the holding company is, shortly, as follows:\n\n 1. \nIt merges the Reading Railway Company in the Reading Company and shears the latter of corporate capacity to do other than a railroad business.\n\n 2. \nIt turns over to trustees of the court for sale or disposition in accord with the plan of groupings by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be adopted under the Transportation Act the majority stock of the New Jersey Railroad Company.\n\n 3. \nIt separates the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company from the New Jersey Railroad Company, by directing the sale of that stock to persons who do not own stock in any of the other companies.\n\n 4. \nIt separates the Reading Company from the Reading Coal Company by a transfer of all the stock in the latter company to a new coal company to be organized by trustees of the court, and directs a distribution to the stockholders of the Reading Company, in proportion to their respective holdings of stock in the latter company, of valuable rights, evidenced by so-called certificates of interest, to dispose of the stock in the new Coal Company. The effect of the decree is to require them either to sell these certificates to others not stockholders in the Reading \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n Company, or to sell their stock in the Reading Company before themselves becoming stockholders in the new Coal Company, or doing neither, and receiving no interest in the interval, to let the court sell the new stock after July 1, 1924, for their account.\n The difficulty in the separation of the interests of the Reading Company and the Reading Coal Company is that the lien of the general mortgage covers much of the property of the Reading Company and all of the stock and property of the Coal Company and is not redeemable until 1997. The plan requires the Reading Company to assume the whole liability of the general mortgage and to save the old and new Coal Companies harmless therefrom in consideration of $10,000,000 cash or current assets and $25, 000,000 in bonds secured by mortgage on all its property by the Reading Coal Company, redeemable at the same time as the general mortgage. This is on the assumption in which all agree that the respective liabilities of the Reading Company and the Coal Company under the lien of the mortgage as between themselves should be regarded as something less than three to one.\n The doubt whether the plan is adequate to secure the object of this court has been prompted by the failure to take out from under the lien of the general mortgage the capital stock and the properties of the Reading Coal Company and the giving of a new mortgage by the Reading Coal Company on all its property to secure bonds to be delivered by it to the Reading Company. The query is whether this would not leave in the Reading Company some possible measure of future control over the Coal Company and enable the Reading Company later on to reestablish in effect the combination which, this court decided, must be ended.\n It is further questioned whether the interest which the new Coal Company, with it, properties still subject to the lien of the general mortgage, will have in preserving the \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n solvency of the Reading Company, would not create a constant motive on its part to favor the Reading Company with its tonnage and discriminate against other carriers reaching its mines. It is pointed out, too, that the interest of the Reading Company in the continuing ability of the Coal Company to avoid default on its proposed mortgage for $25,000,000 to secure bonds to be given to the Reading Company, would prompt a community of operation between the two companies which it was the object of this court to end.\n All these difficulties, it is said, could be removed if all of the properties and stock of the Coal Company were sold outright and the purchase money applied to the satisfaction pro tanto of the general mortgage by depositing with the trustee cash or current securities equal to one-third of the amount of the general mortgage debt, as the fair ratio of the Coal Company's contribution to the security of that company, the remainder of the proceeds of sale to go to the Reading Company for its proper disposition as assets of its own.\n When the mandate went down, the District Court invited the Reading Company to propose a plan for the dissolution of the illegal combination for submission to all the parties in interest, including, of course, the government. The first form of plan contemplated that the release of the stock and properties of the Reading Coal Company from the lien of the general mortgage should be secured by the Reading Company's paying to each bondholder, in consideration of his release, a cash premium of the per cent. of the par value of the bonds he held. This did not meet with the favor of the bondholders or of the trustee. The common stockholders of the Reading Company also objected. The Solicitor General in his discussion of the plan pur the case thus:\n'The Attorney General, therefore, was confronted with these alternatives: (1) To insist upon the court ordering \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 169]\n\u00a0\n the release of the stock and properties of the Reading Coal Company from the lien of the general mortgage without the consent and over the protest of the trustee and the bondholders; or (2) to assent to a modification of the plan which while placing in different hands the stock control of the Reading Company and the Reading Coal Company and providing effective safeguards against future corporate relations would leave the stock and properties of the latter pledged under the general mortgage.\n\n'The following considerations appeared to make the latter course the wiser as well as the more expedient:\n\n'(1) The attitude of the trustee and bondholders made it clear that the former course would meet with an opposition which certainly would have resulted in another appeal to this court with consequent delay in effecting a dissolution.'\n\n The fourth reason was stated as follows:\n'(4) Finally, and most important, the country at that time was in the midst of a serious financial and industrial depression accompanying the transition from the artificial stimulations of war to normal conditions of peace. The condition was regarded as critical. Grave apprehension was felt that if the government should insist upon the disruption of the general mortgage, public confidence in the restoration of prosperity might be adversely affected. It seemed the course of wisdom, therefore, to avoid the possibility of contributing further to an already threatening situation if it could be done without sacrifice to the effectiveness of the dissolution. The government was not averse to any necessary surgery, but it seemed wise not to amputate any more than was necessary to secure the great policy of the Sherman law. In this, it followed the admonition of this court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases that innocent interests, as the present holders of the bonds in question were, should be spared unnecessary injury.'- \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n\n It is asserted further by the Reading Company, and not denied, that, when this decree was entered by the District Court, the monetare situation was such that it would have been impossible to secure a purperties at any Reading Coal Company properties at any fair price; that, indeed, the transaction could not have been financed at all.\n The considerations influencing the District Court and the government against a drastic readjustment of the interests of the bondholders under the general mortgage and the holdings of the two offending companies were of manifest weight in the then business and monetary situation. Even now this court would hesitate to order a sale of this kind of property worth probably $100,000,000 with confident hope of realizing an adequate amount with the necessary restrictions as to the purchaser. We agree with the Attorney General in his disinclination to insist upon such a sale under the circumstances. Since the time of settling the decree, however, a change for the better has come in the financial situation. We think that this justifies us now in making some modifications in the plan, which were not presented to the parties or considered by the court, possibly because they might have been unwise in the critical conditions then existing. They involve a departure from the contract provisions of the general mortgage and the bonds it secures.\n The petition of the trustee under the general mortgage urges that a court of equity ought not, by its decree, summarily to wrench the Coal Company's property from under the pledge of the mortgage, or to vary its terms in view of the circumstances. It points out that neither the trustee nor the bondholders were made parties to the original bill to set aside the combination and monopoly, and that the trustee was made a party to the proceeding only after the mandate of this court went down. The petition avers the innocence of any wrongdoing on the part of the bondholders, and alleges that, of the $106,000,000 \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 171]\n\u00a0\n of bonds issued, $50,000,000 were issued at or about the date of the mortgage in 1896, $36,000,000 were issued between 1897 and 1920 to take up and in exchange for underlying bonds that were liens prior to reorganization and for the most part prior to the passage of the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), and $20,000,000 were issued between 1898 and 1911 for betterments. It further alleges that for twenty years after this mortgage was executed, its validity, as far as the bondholders are concerned, has not been questioned by the government, and these bonds have passed into the hands of numerous and widely scattered holders; that few of them, if any, are or were identified at all with the management of the Reading Company or Coal Company, and many of the bonds are held by fiduciaries.\n The power of the court under the Sherman Anti-Trust Law to disregard the letter and legal effect of the bonds and general mortgage under the circumstances of this case, in order to achieve the purpose of the law, we cannot question. The principles laid down and followed in the case of United States v. Southern Pacific Company et al., \n259 U.S. 214\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 496, 66 L. Ed. --, decided to-day, leave no doubt upon this point. Indeed, the case which we there cite, Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington Railroad Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 613\n, 614 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 589, is a stronger instance of the power of Congress in regulating interstate commerce to disregard contracts than is needed in this case, because there it was enforced as to a contract made before the regulation. It may be conceded, as averred, that the bondholders in this case were innocent of any actual sense of wrongdoing, that they relied on the advice of eminent counsel in assuming that the union of the Railroad and the Coal Companies under the control of the holding company was not a violation of the Sherman Law, and that some of them surrendered bonds secured by underlying liens of unquestioned validity \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 172]\n\u00a0\n created before the enactment of the Sherman Law. Nevertheless, spread all over the face of the general mortgage, was the information and notice of the union of the railway and coal properties for the very purpose which is the head and front of the offending under the Anti-Trust Law, and which requires this court to dissolve the illegal combination. The general mortgage was the indispensable instrument of the unlawful conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce. It was the advantage of the legally improper relation between the railway and coal interests which made the security so attractive. In one of the phases of a case, reported as United States v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry. Co. (D. C.) 203 Fed. 295, the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit was obliged to consider on an intervening petition, the question of the power of the court under the Sherman Act to deal with a mortgage whose lien if held to be inviolable interfered with the effective dissolution of the offending combination of a railway company and a coal company. The opinion is not reported,1 but we have been furnished a certified copy of the memorandum opinion and its language is so pertinent that we quote it as expressing our view:\n'One who takes a mortgage upon several items of property of such character that their common ownership or operation may offend against the Anti-Trust Law or the commodities clause, and such that the mortgage serves practically to aid in tying them together, must be deemed to hold his mortgage subject to the contingency that if the complete and final separation of one item of the mortgage property from the remainder becomes essential to the due enforcement of either named law, the court charged with such enforcement may take control of that item, free it from the consolidating tendency of the mortgage, and substitute therefor its judicially ascertained equivalent. Otherwise the mortgage will stand as the ready means of restoring-or at least tending to restore-- \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 173]\n\u00a0\n those conditions which the court's is endeavoring to destroy. It may well be true that a railroad and a coal company under common ownership and management are worth more as security under a mortgage than when independent and that their effective separation does impair the mortgage security, but this cannot make the law helpless.'\n\n We have no desire to vary the security of the bondholders more than seems necessary to effect fully the purpose of the law, and wish to recognize their equities as against the two companies and the stockholders, as will later appear.\n We think that the plan should be changed in accord with the following suggestions: The District Court should, after a hearing of all interested parties, determine the respective values of the properties of the merged Reading Company and the Coal Company which are subject to lien of the general mortgage. Then the decree should direct that the liability of each on the bonds and the pledge under the mortgage shall be modified as between the mortgagee and the mortgagors, so that the liability of the Reading Company on the bonds outstanding, and the lien of the mortgage upon that company's property to secure them, shall be reduced to an amount proportionate to the ratio of the value of its pledged property to the value of all the property pledged including that of the Coal Company. The obligation of the Coal Company upon such bonds and the lien upon its property to secure them should be reduced in corresponding proportion. The amount that each company is to pay as interest should be similarly fixed, and specific provisions for foreclosure of these separate liens on default and requisite machinery and other necessary changes to carry out the result will be made by the District Court in its discretion. By this arrangement the interests and joint obligations of the Reading Company and the Coal Company will be completely severed and the purpose of this court carried out. \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 174]\n\u00a0\n The Reading Company's first plan contemplated the securing of a voluntary release of the Coal Company's property by the bondholders through payment of 10 per cent. of the par value of his bonds to each bondholder; but the proposal did not meet with favor. We leave it to the District Court to determine what, if any, injury to the security this modification of the terms of the debt and mortgage may cause, and to compensate for it by such a payment to the bondholders by either or both companies as may seem equitable and convenient.\n The changes involved in these suggestions may interfere with, or make inapplicable, the provisions of the present plan looking to a proper working capital for the Reading Company. Authority is therefore given to the District Court to amend the plan in any way which seems wise to leave the Reading Company properly financed to meet its obligations to the public.\n It does not seem necessary to change the general form of that feature of the plan by which, through the distribution of certificates of interest to the stockholders of the old Reading Company in the stock of the new Coal Company, the stock relations of the old Reading Company and the present Coal Company are to be ended, though we would not limit the power of the District Court in this regard. It may be found necessary to increase the price of $2 per share in the Reading Company which the recipients of the certificates of interest in the stock of the new Coal Company are to pay therefor, in order to reserve more cash to the Reading Company in that transaction; but this the District Court can determine. The adopted plan was nicely adjusted to secure a practical working basis for both companies, and we would not embarrass the District Court, after a full hearing of all the parties, in the detailed changes which it may find practically necessary to adopt in following the general outlines of our modification of the plan.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 156, 175]\n\u00a0\n We think it not unreasonable to accept the suggestion made at the bar, namely, that not only shall the stockholers of the Coal Company upon receiving and registering their stock be required to make affidavit that they have no stock ownership in the Reading Company, and are not acting for, or representing, any one who has, but also that the merged Reading Company shall be required to adopt a by-law, effective till the further order of the court, permitting registration of transfers of shares of its capital stock in the names only of persons who shall make affidavit that they are not stockholders, registered or actual, in either the new or the old Coal Company, and have not been and are not holders of proxies to vote shares of stock therein.\n As to the New Jersey Railroad Company and the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, we have heard no criticism and the provisions as to them are approved. By the decree, the new Coal Company, its officers and directors, are enjoined from voting the Coal Company stock so as to form a combination between the Coal Company and the Reading Company. The Reading Company and all persons acting for or in its interest are perpetually enjoined from acquiring, receiving, holding, voting, or in any manner acting as the owner of any shares of the new Coal Company, and the new Coal Company and all persons acting for it are enjoined from acquiring, or voting, any of the shares of the Reading Company. The Coal Company will be permanently enjoined from issuing to the Reading Company, and the Reading Company from receiving, any stock, bonds, or other evidences of corporate indebtedness of the Coal Company. On default the trustee of the mortgage is required to vote the Coal Company stock, so as not to bring about a recurrence of the conditions condemned in this cause, and, if it shall be necessary to sell the properties, they are to be sold to different interests. The Attorney General and his successors in office \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 176]\n\u00a0\n are given by the decree full opportunity to keep a watch upon the relations between the two companies and to appeal to the court for prompt enforcement of the injunctions of the decree as they may be advised. The court retains large control of the decree with power to assure its continued efficacy by the summary remedy of contempt. With these restrictive provisions and the modifications of the plan outlined above, we think that the independence of the four companies will be fully achieved.\n We come now to the issue upon which these appeals were brought here. It concerns the respective rights of the common stockholders and the preferred stockholders in the assets of the Reading Company. They all, under the plan, will receive the benefit of the difference between the real value of the privilege of disposing of their distributive certificates of interest in stock in the new Coal Company, and the payment of $2 or such other sum as may be fixed, per share held by them of the Reading Company stock. Such difference has already been the subject of sale and quotation on the market in New York and has varied from $11 to $ 20. This might have been expected in view of the disparity between par of the capital stock of the Reading Coal Company and the far greater actual value of its properties. The disparity shows that while the transfer of certificates of interest in the new Coal Company stock is denominated a sale, it is only a distribution of the surplus or assets of the Reading Company to its stockholders made necessary by the decree of this court in taking the Reading Company out of the coal business and restricting it to that of owning and operating a railroad system. The Reading Company by merger with the Reading Railway Company is made to change its character. Under the plan it must comply with the Act of May 3, 1909 (P. L. 408; Pa. St. 1920,  5748 et seq.), by which, in merging with the Reading Railway Company, it becomes a new corporation. Penn. Utilities Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 177]\n\u00a0\n 69 Pa. Super. Ct. 612; Lauman v. Lebanon Valley R. R. Co., 30 Pa. 42, 45, 72 Am. Dec. 685; Clearwater v. Meredith, 1 Wall. 25; C., Atlantic & G. R. v. Georgia, \n98 U.S. 359\n; Yazoo & Miss. Ry. v. Adams, \n180 U.S. 1\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 240; Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 319\n.\n What is to be done is in fact and law a liquidation of the assets of the old Reading Company. Its stockholders receive their distribution in kind by retention of the stock they held in the old Reading Company as stock in the reduced new Reading Company, purged of its offense against the law, together with the distributive values of that which the old Reading Company has been compelled to get rid of; i. e., the ownership of the stock of the Coal Company. The distribution of certificates of interest in the new Coal Company shares was evidently given the form of a sale to enable the new Reading Company to realize out of it $5,600,000 in cash to give it additional working capital enough properly to operate the Reading Railway System. But this does not change its real nature as a mere distribution of forbidden assets in kind to stockholders.\n The rights of the common and preferred stockholders of the Reading Company intersese are to be determined by the organization agreement of 1896. At that time, under a special charter of a corporation known as the Excelsior Enterprise Company granted by the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1871, the Reading Company, by change of name, came into being. The capital stock was increased to $140,000,000, divided into 2,800,000 shares of the par value of $50 each. Half of these were preferred, $28,000,000 first preferred, and $42,000,000 second preferred. The other half, or $70,000, 000, were common, and the rights of the preferred and common stock were fixed by agreement. Each share of stock, whether common or preferred, had a vote. The agreement provided that the preferred stock should be entitled to noncumulative dividends--\n'at the \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 178]\n\u00a0\n rate of, but not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum, in each and every fiscal year, in preference and priority to any payment in or for such fiscal year, or any dividend on other stock; but only from undivided net profits of the company when and as determined by the board of directors, and only if and when the board shall declare dividends therefrom. If, after providing for the payment of full dividends for any fiscal year on the first preferred stock, there shall remain any surplus undivided net profits, the board out of such surplus may declare and pay dividends for such year upon the second preferred stock. If, from the business of any particular fiscal year, excluding undivided net profits remaining from previous years, after providing out of the net profits of such particular fiscal year for the payment of the full dividends for such fiscal year on the first and second preferred stock, there shall remain surplus net profits, the board of directors may declare, and out of such surplus net profits of such year may pay, dividends any other stock of the company. But no dividends shall in any year be paid upon any such other stock out of net profits of any previous fiscal year in which the full dividends shall not have been paid on the first and second preferred stock.'\n\n The company was given the right at any time to redeem either or both classes of its preferred stock at par in cash, if such redemption should then be allowed by law, and after payment of dividends of 4 per cent. for two successive years on the first preferred stock, to convert the second preferred stock, not exceeding $42,000,000, par value, one-half into first preferred stock, and one-half into common stock, and to increase its first preferred and common stock to the extent necessary to effect such conversion. The company never exercised the right to convert or redeem the preferred stock.\n It will be observed that the preferred stock and the common stock with 1,400,000 shares of each were thus \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 179]\n\u00a0\n given and equality of voting power which could not be changed without the consent of the company, and that it has not been changed either by conversion or redemption. This would seem to have been designed to preserve an equilibrium of control, in which reasonable dividends out of profits when they accrued in sufficient amount would be voted to the common stockholders, on the one hand, and proper additions would be made out of earnings to the capital of the company to increase its future profit-earning capacity, and create a greater security for a constant payment of dividends to preferred stockholders. Of course there would not be block voting of the two classes of stock, but the division did tend to secure a fair representation of both interests in the board of directors.\n The effect of the agreement as to dividends upon the preferred and common stock seems to us clear. It emphasizes that dividends are to be paid only out of undivided profits, and when and as determined by the board of directors, and only if and when the board shall declare them. It leaves to the board to determine in its discretion whether the undivided profits shall be put in surplus working capital or in dividends. The limitations on the discretion of the board are that the first and second preferred cannot receive more than 4 per cent. in any fiscal year, and that neither the second preferred nor the common stock can receive any dividend until the first preferred dividend has been paid in full each year, and the common stock receives nothing until the second preferred dividends is thus paid. The words describing the condition upon which the power of the board to declare dividends on the common stock can be exercised show that each year's profits are to be considered by themselves in the distribution of dividends between the stock.\n Appellants, however, rely on the final words of the clause to show that it is intended that net profits in any past year can be thereafter allowed to the common stock, \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 180]\n\u00a0\n if in that past year the preferred stock had been paid full dividends. We do not find it necessary to decide that the board of directors has not such power; but, if so, the power is not one the exercise of which can be compelled, in the absence of fraud or breach of trust. The failure of the board to exercise it, and the application of the earnings to surplus determine such earnings to be assets as of the time of the compulsory winding up and liquidation of the corporation. The power to declare dividends not exercised can have no more effect upon the rights of the preferred stockholders to share in the existing assets of the corporation when liquidated than the failure of the company to convert preferred stock into common, or to redeem the preferred stock at par. The proper interpretation of the agreement is that, after the declaration of dividends for any current year, the undivided earnings are to be regarded as capital assets and to be distributed on liquidation, unless the board of directors has meantime applied them as dividends. If the argument of appellants were carried to its logical result, all the net earnings of the Reading Company in 25 years, no matter how invested or applied to increasing the earning capital, must in a liquidation be treated as undistributed profits, to go entirely to the common stock without any action of the board of directors. This is impossible.\n The record discloses that in 1904, when the Reading Company made its application to the New York Stock Exchange to have its stock listed, it contained the following statement:\n'The preferred and common stock have equal voting power, and in liquidation or dissolution of the corporation will share equally in pro rata distribution of assets.'\n\n Coming as this must have come from the representatives of both the preferred and common stockholders, it is significant evidence of what they then thought of their \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 181]\n\u00a0\n respective rights and has the additional weight of a representation to future purchasers of the two classes of stock as to the kind of interests they were buying in the company.\n Our conclusion that the claim on behalf of the common stockholders is invalid is based on the construction of the words of the agreement itself and hardly needs authority to sustain it. It is, however, in accord with the general common-law rule that stockholders, common and preferred, share alike in the assets of a liquidating corporation, if the preference is only as to dividends.

Niles v. Ludlow Co. (D. C.) 196 Fed. 994; Russell v. American Gas Co., 152 App. Div. 136, 136 N. Y. Supp. 602.\n Counsel for one of the appellants has called attention to the fact, not appearing in any assignment of error, that among the assets of the old Reading Company which the new Reading Company will continue to hold is $1, 000,000 par value and of much greater actual value in the stock of the Reading Iron Company, an iron manufacturing company, and that under the Constitution of Pennsylvania \n\n[259 U.S. 156, 182]\n\u00a0\n it will be unlawful for the new Reading Company as a railroad company to continue to own it. Questions as to the propriety and legality of this holding of the Old Reading Company did not arise when the case was before this court originally, and do not arise on the record before us now, in any such way as to enable us to say whether the federal commodities clause or the Constitution of Pennsylvania will thus be violated in carrying out the plan by which the Reading Company is to become a railroad company. This must be determined by the District Court in further hearings and consideration at the time the final decree comes to be settled in accordance with our mandate, when it will have authority to modify the plan in this repect to satisfy the requirements of law.\n The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with modifications already indicated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reported in full in 281 Fed. 1011. \n\n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORNELI v.

Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 491, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, though having different parties and coming from different courts, are dependent upon the same considerations. They differ in some details but they all involve the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and its assistant legislation, the National Prohibition Act.\n The amendment after its ratification prohibited for beverage purposes, among other things, the transportation of intoxicating liquor within the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof. And Congress and the states were given concurrent power to enforce the prohibition by appropriate legislation.\n Congress in pursuance of that power passed the National Prohibition ( Volstead) Act. 41 Stat. 305. Are the cases at bar within the mandate and the prohibition, are the special questions involved in them?\n First as to the cases as displayed in the bills-there are some differences in their averments but their essential allegations identifying them in principle are as follows: The appellees were, respectively, collectors of internal revenue for the First internal revenue district of the state of Missouri, the district of Maryland, and the Sixth internal revenue district of the state of Missouri. It was the duty of each to collect and receive taxes on distilled spirits in government bonded warehouses, and, upon payment of the taxes, to issue revenue stamps showing the payment of the taxes. As such officers they had, respectively, the custody and control of the spirits, and the right of ingress to and egress from the warehouses.\n Each appellant became the purchaser of a barrel of whisky in one of the warehouses (it is designated) \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 494]\n\u00a0\n which was identified and which he was desirous of removing to his dwelling for use and disposition of the spirits according to law. The appellees refused to release or deliver the spirits, or to accept the payment of the taxes thereon which appellants either tendered or, on account of opposing declarations of appellees, omitted to tender.\n The refusal of appellees to release the spirits is asserted to be wrongful and illegal and a violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in that it deprives appellants of their property without due process of law and takes it for public use without just compensation.\n The prayers of the bills were in effect (we disregard particulars) to require appellees to do what was necessary to release the spirits from the warehouses and to enable them to be transported to the respective dwellings of appellants.\n The bills were dismissed upon motions of appellees.\n Against the rulings upon the motions, and against the decrees dismissing the bills, appellants adduce certain provisions of the National Prohibition Act and cite Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., \n254 U.S. 88\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 31, 10 A. L. R. 1548\n\n\n So much of the cited portions as is relevant we insert in the margin. We may observe, however, that while their provisions extend to the manufacture, sale and other disposition of intoxicating beverages, as well as to their transportation, we only insert the provisions concerning the latter1. \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 495]\n\u00a0\n Before considering the provisions here specially involved, we may say that the act has been sustained, and it has been decreed that the power of Congress can be asserted against the disposal for beverage purposes, of all liquor manufactured before the amendment became effective, as it can be asserted against subsequent manufacture for those purposes. Either case is within the constitutional mandate and prohibition.\n A consideration of the act becomes necessary. Section 3 is comprehensive in its prohibition, and it takes pains to provide that it shall have such liberality of construction as to achieve its declared purpose. \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 496]\n\u00a0\n It is, however, contended that there is modification of this apparent universality of prohibition, and that, by a permission of traffic in warehouse receipts, liquor in storage in bonded warehouses is not subject to the ban of the section.\n Regarding the words of section 3 in connection with some of the provisions of sections 25 and 33, they give some plausibility to the contention and some puzzle to construction, but we are repelled nevertheless from those of appellants. To accept them would defeat the purpose of the act and its achievement of the mandate of the Constitution. That mandate is, as will be seen by reference to section 1 of the amendment, 'that the transportation of intoxicating liquor within ... the United States ... for beverage purposes' shall be prohibited. And, as we have said, the act declares (sec. 3) that all of its provisions shall be liberally construed 'to the end,' to quote its words, 'that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.' The method of appellants, we think, tended to the opposite effect-tended to the use of liquor as beverage, not its prevention.\n We are unable to see in section 33 which takes illegality from the 'liquors in one's private dwelling while the same is occupied and used by him as his dwelling only' and the rights that may attach to liquors in such situation an intention to extend such rights to liquors not so situated or, to put it more pointedly, an intention to make all bonded warehouses of the country outbuildings of its dwellings.\n There is nothing favorable to appellants' contention in section 372. It permits transportation to bonded warehouses \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 497]\n\u00a0\n but not from them as inferred by appellants. Transtion from them is confined to transportation to a wholesale druggist for sale to him for purposes not prohibited. A permit is necessary even for this.\n In connection with section 37, section 6, title III of the act is pertinent. It permits distilled spirits produced and fit for beverage purposes remaining in bonded warehouses to be withdrawn for denaturing 'or for deposit in a bonded warehouse established by the act.'\n Counsel urge Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., supra, against this conclusion, and as sustaining their contention. In that case, by motion to dismiss, it was admitted that Street was the lessee of a room in the Deposit Company's Warehouse, in which he had stored liquors, acquired prior to the effective date of the National Prohibition Act, which liquors were 'in his exclusive possession and control and are intended and will be used only for personal consumption by himself and the members of his family or his bona fide guests.' The storage room was obviously the use of a convenience very commonly employed and contributory to his dwelling, and therefore, for the reasons stated in that opinion, it was concluded that the National Prohibition Act did not render unlawful the storage of liquors there involved or their transportation, under proper permit, to the dwelling of the owner for lawful uses. And this difference in the facts in the case from those in the cases at bar removes it as a precedent. There is no analogy in Street's relation to the room in the Deposit Company's warehouse and appellants' relation to bonded warehouses. They had neither control, access to or possession of the spirits they purchased. Mere ownership was not the equivalent. Under section 33 there must be ownership, and possession in one's private dwelling, and that character cannot be assigned to the bonded warehouses of the government. \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 498]\n\u00a0\n Comment on other provisions of the act we do not think is necessary. A reference to them demonstrates that they have no militating force against our conclusion.\n But appellants contend the effect we assign to the act is to assign to it the effect of depriving them of their property without due process of law or taking it for public purposes without just compensation. To understand the conditions of the contention, a distinction in the cases must be noted. The purchases by appellants were at different dates. The spirits purchased by Corneli were all stored in bond in the spring of 1917, a date prior to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. Bryan became the owner of his on the 2d of October, 1919, and, therefore, prior to the effective date of the Volstead Act, which was January 16, 1920. Billon v. Gloss, \n256 U.S. 368\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 510. Ghio's purchase was about the 28th of February, 1920, which was after the date of the Amendment and the effective date of the Volstead Act. Eastes avers his ownership dates from August 24, 1917.\n In considering the bearing of the dates of purchase and their relation to the dates of the Amendment and the Volstead Act, the question of their construction blends in the discussion somewhat confusingly with the question of their constitutionality. It is as serted that the Eighteenth Amendment was not intended to be retrospective and that if it and the Volstead Act should be so treated, that is, if applied to liquor manufactured and lawfully acquired before their respective dates they are void-they thereby taking from property its essential attributes, 'the right to use it, possess it and enjoy it' contrary to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and that the Fifth Amendment is not repealed by the Eighteenth Amendment. We are not disposed to trace the elements of the contentions minutely-they are answered in all their phases by the National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 387\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 588.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 499]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n These cases differ somewhat and I speak with reference to No. 174- Corneli v. Moore, Collector-finally determined on motion to dismiss.\n The opinion and ruling just announced seem to me in direct conflict with Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co. (1920) \n254 U.S. 88\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 31, 10 A. L. R. 1548. I think the reasoning of that opinion is bad; but it has been adopted, and the construction which it placed upon the act should be adhered to or frankly overruled. The effort to distinguish the present case from the earlier one is but toying with the immaterial.\n Prior to the enactment of any national prohibition law and during the spring of 1917, Corneli acquired the barrel of distilled spirits numbered 125,694, then on deposit in United States general bonded warehouse No. 1, St. Louis, Mo., where he resides. In strict conformity with law he allowed the spirits to remain there until the autumn of 1920, when he offered to pay the taxes and demanded permission to move them to his home for lawful use.\n In Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., wines and liquors, worth more than $3,000 'securely and properly packed and stored in bottles, barrels, casks and cases' had long been held in the large public warehouse, No. 60 East Forty-Second Street, New York City, owned and operated by the Deposit Company and it was alleged that 'complainant does not intend to remove the same voluntarily except as they may be required from time to time for consumption.' Notwithstanding the inhibitions of the Volstead Act it was ruled that the owner might continue to store them for an indefinite period and then remove them to his dwelling for personal use. The opinion not only declared the storage lawful but also said (\n254 U.S. 93\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 33, 10 A. L. R. 1548):\n'That transportation of the liquors to the home of appellant, \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 500]\n\u00a0\n under the admitted circumstances, is not such as is prohibited by the section is too apparent to justify detailed consideration of the many provisions of the act inconsistent with a construction which would render such removal unlawful. ...'\n\n Corneli intrusted his supply to a government warehouse as permitted by the statute, and is denied the privilege of taking it home because that warehouse is not contributory to his dwelling, nor an adjunct thereto, nor an outbuilding connected therewith. Street made no such claim concerning the Forty-Second Street warehouse-indeed, his counsel seem to have been wholly ignorant of this extraordinary extention of his home-and the decree in his favor was not rested on that gossamer. It went upon the assumption that Congress never intended to prohibit bona fide owners of lawfully acquired liquors from storing and removing them for personal use at home, although the government stoutly maintained the contrary view. The following quotation from the opinion sufficiently indicates the theory accepted by the court:\n'It may be that the custody of liquors by a warehouse company was thus not declared to be unlawful because the writers of the act did not have such a case in mind, but it was more probably because Congress would not consent to allow lawful possession and use of liquors in dwellings having storage facilities for them, while denying the only possible means of preserving and protecting such liquors to persons with less commodious homes. The Congress was concerned with the great problem of preventing the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes in the future, and it seems to have given but slight attention to the consumption of such relatively small amounts of such liquors as might be in existence in private ownership and intended for consumption by the owner, his family or his guests, when the amendment and the act should take effect. An intention \n\n[257 U.S. 491, 501]\n\u00a0\n to confiscate private property, even in intoxicating liquors, will not be raised by inference and construction from provisions of law which have ample field for other operation in effecting a purpose clearly indicated and declared.'\n\n If Corneli had only suspected the remarkable power of the Forty- Second Street warehouse to attach itself to the dwellings of all patrons, without regard to distance, he might have chosen a safer course. He stored where the statute said he might. Now he is told that no analogy exists between his lonely barrel there and the many 'bottles, barrels, casks and cases' which, within more favored walls, await the pleasure of their owner. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 3.

HART(1922)\nNo. 71\nArgued: November 16, 1922Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles R. Pierce, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Eugene W. Britt and William J. Hunsaker, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee. \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves conflicting claims to a tract of 160 acres of land in Imperial county (formerly San Diego county), state of California. The facts, so far as necessary to be stated, are as follows:\n About the years 1854-56 the body of public lands, which includes the tract in controversy, was surveyed under the authority of the United States. No settlements upon these lands of any consequence were made until the year 1900. In the interval the marks of the survey had so far disappeared as to render it practically impossible to locate the lines which the survey had established. None of the section or township corners originally placed upon or in the vicinity of the land here involved was in place, and it was impossible to determine by reference to that survey in what section it was located.\n On July 1, 1902, Congress provided for a resurvey of this body of public lands, by an act (32 Stat. 728) as follows:\n'That the Secretary of the Interior, be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause to be made a resurvey of the lands in San Diego county, in the state of California, embraced in and consisting of the tier of townships thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen south, of ranges eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and sixten east, and the fractional township seventeen south, of ranges fifteen and sixteen east, all of San Bernardino base and meridian; and all rules and regulations of the Interior Department requiring petitions from all settlers of said townships asking for resurvey and agreement to abide by the result of the same so far as these lands are concerned are hereby abrogated: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to impair the present bona fide claim of any actual occupant of any of said lands to the lands so occupied.' \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n The resurvey thus authorized was made and the approved plats filed in 1909\n\n\n\n On March 28, 1908, Congress passed an act to limit and restrict the right of entry and assignment under the desert land law and to authorize an extension of the time within which to make final proof. 35 Stat. 52. Section 1 of that act is as follows:\n'That from and after the passage of this act the right to make entry of desert lands under the provisions of the act approved March third, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven, entitled 'An act to provide for the sale of desert lands in certain states and territories,' as amended by the act approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety- one, entitled 'An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes,' shall be restricted to surveyed public lands of the character contemplated by said acts, and no such entries of unsurveyed lands shall be allowed or made of record: Provided, however, that any individual qualified to make entry of desert lands under said acts who has, prior to survey, taken possession of a tract of unsurveyed desert land not exceeding in area three hundred and twenty acres in compact form, and has reclaimed or has in good faith commenced the work of reclaiming the same, shall have the preference right to make entry of such tract under said acts, in conformity with the public land surveys, within ninety days after the filing of the approved plat of survey in the district land office.' Comp. St.  4681.\n\n The appellee (plaintiff below), during the year 1906, being then of age and qualified, began the work of reclaiming a tract of 320 acres, including the lands here in controversy. Previously, and shortly before she was of age, her father, acting in her behalf, had caused a furrow to be plowed around the entire 320-acre tract, and had posted a notice claiming it for the appellee. During the year 1906 appellee caused about 80 acres of that portion of \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n the tract lying east of the lands in controversy to be leveled, cleared and seeded to barley, and ditches for irrigating the same to be constructed. All the lands at that time were unoccupied desert lands, within the meaning of the land laws of the United States. The barley was irrigated several times during the year. After the crop had matured and during the year 1906 the appellee fenced the land upon which it had been grown, and also during the year seeded to barley about 5 acres of the 160 acres in controversy. This crop, however, did not mature. Early in November, 1906, the appellee constructed a head ditch along the east line of the specific tract in controversy and did some work in preparation for the irrigation of the south half thereof, and also put up stakes upon the south half to mark the lines. She also caused borders to be made along the east line in preparation for the construction of a head ditch. This was the state of things on November 8, 1906, when the appellant put up a tent house upon the land, established a residence and claimed the 160-acre tract. Appellant saw the plowed furrows along the east and south sides of the land and was notified by appellee's father that that 160-acre tract was included within appellee's 320-acre claim. Appellant remained on the tract until he was ejected, in March, 1909, as the result of a judgment obtained by appellee against him in a state court. Hart v. Cox, 171 Cal. 364, 153 Pac. 391. Appellant during his occupancy constructed a ditch one- half mile in length and did some other work on the land.\n Appellant, in July, 1907, filed an application for the land in the local land office, but his application was rejected for the reason that the description was defective. Later in the same month appellee filed an application for the entire 320-acre tract, but her application was rejected.\n In March, 1909, after the resurvey had been completed, appellant filed a new application and shortly thereafter \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n and within 90 days after the filing of the survey plat, appellee also filed a new application, both applications describing the lands with reference to the resurvey. Decision was rendered in the local land office in favor of appellant. The Commissioner of the General Land Office reversed this decision, but the Secretary of the Interior reversed the Commissioner and affirmed the local land office in favor of appellant. Subsequently, on October 24, 1918, a patent was issued to the appellant for the land in controversy.\n Appellee thereupon brought suit against the appellant in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and prayed a decree declaring that appellant held the land in trust and requiring appellant to convey the legal title to her. That court rendered a decree in favor of appellee, and the case was carried by appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where, after hearing, the decree of the District Court was affirmed. 270 Fed. 51. The case is here upon appeal from the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The rights of the parties turn upon the meaning and effect of the proviso to section 1 of the Act of March 28, 1908, heretofore quoted. That priviso is, in substance, that where a qualified entryman has prior to survey taken possession of a tract not exceeding 320 acres of unsurveyed desert land and has reclaimed or in good faith commenced the work of reclaiming the same he shall have the preference right to make entry of such tract within 90 days after the filing of the plat of survey in the local land office. Two questions are, therefore, presented for solution:\n\n\n (1)\n Did appellee take possession of the lands and reclaim or in good faith commence the work of reclaiming the same prior to the attempted appropriation by appellant?\n\n\n (2)\n Were the lands at the time unsurveyed desert lands, to which upon the facts the statutory preference \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n right to make entry attached? Appellant denies that the lands were unsurveyed and contends, moreover, that in any event, appellee is not within the terms of the proviso since whatever she did was prior to the passage of the act which is not to be given retrospective operation.\n\n 1. \nPrior to appellant's occupation on November 8, 1906, appellee had entered upon and exercised and was then exercising the acts of dominion herein set forth over the 320-acre tract under a claim of right. When appellant entered upon the land all these evidences of appellee's claim and possession were open and visible and in addition appellant was specifically notified that the claim included the land in controversy.\n What will constitute possession of land largely depends upon its character, condition and the use to which it is adapted. Here appellee went upon the land for the purpose of reclaiming it from its desert character. The whole of it obviously could not be reclaimed at once. The building of ditches, the securing of a water supply, the plowing and preparation of the land and the planting of crops were all steps requiring time. Residence upon the land was not required as a prerequisite to securing title under the Desert Land Laws. Having in view all the conditions we are of opinion that the facts sufficiently establish appellee's actual possession of the entire tract at the time appellant sought to make his appropriation. Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Pet. 412, 442; Ewing v. Burnet, 11 Pet. 41, 53; Hart v. Cox, 171 Cal. 364, 153 Pac. 391; Booth & Graham v. Small & Small, 25 Iowa, 177, 181; Illinois Steel Co. v. Bilot and Wife, 109 Wis. 418, 443, 446, 84 N. W. 855, 85 N. W. 402, 83 Am. St. Rep. 905. It is not necessary to constitute actual possession that there should be an inclosure or any physical or visible occupancy of every part of the land. As well said by the Supreme Court of Iowa in Booth v. Small, supra:\n'Possession of land is the holding of and exclusive exercise of dominion over it. It is evident that this is not, \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n and cannot be, uniform in every case, and that there may be degrees in the exclusiveness even of the exercise of ownership. The owner cannot occupy literally the whole tract; he cannot have an actual pedis possessio of all, nor hold it in the grasp of his hands. His possession must be indicated by other acts. The usual one is that of inclosure. But this cannot always be done, yet he may hold the possession in fact of uninclosed land, by the exercise of such acts of ownership over it as are necessary to enjoy the ordinary use of which it is capable, and acquire the profits it yields in its present condition; such acts, being continued and uninterrupted, will amount to actual possession, and, if under color of title, or claim of right, will be adverse.'\n\n That appellee, in addition to taking possession of the entire 320 acres before appellant's occupancy, had in good faith commenced the work of reclaiming the same, does not admit of doubt. Indeed she had actually reclaimed more than one-fourth of the entire area, which included 5 acres of the tract in controversy.\n\n 2. \nIt remains to determine whether the lands at the time appellee took possession of them were unsurveyed lands and whether appellee was entitled to the preference right granted by the proviso heretofore quoted.\n We first dispose of the contention that, even if the lands were unsurveyed, it cannot be held that appellee was within the terms of the proviso because that would be to give the proviso a retroactive effect and there is nothing to show that Congress so intended. The rule is, of course, well settled that unless the contrary plainly appear a statute operates prospectively only. Does the application of the proviso here proposed contravene this rule?\n Prior to the Act of March 28, 1908 (35 Stat. 52), unsurveyed lands, as well as surveyed lands, came within the purview of the Desert Land Laws ( 19 Stat. 377). That act, however, from and after its passage restricted 'the right to make entry of desert lands ... to surveyed \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n public lands' and expressly declared that 'no such entries of unsurveyed lands shall be allowed or made of record. Then follows the proviso now being considered. The office of a proviso is well understood. It is to except something from the operative effect, or to qualify or restrain the generality, of the substantive enactment to which it is attached. Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423. Although it is sometimes misused to introduce independent pieces of legislation. Georgia Railway & Banking Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 47; White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545, 551\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 171. Here, however, the proviso is plainly employed in its primary character. The effect of the substantive enactment was to forbid the entry of unsurveyed lands. But the law theretofore had been otherwise, and one purpose of the proviso evidently was to exclude from the operative effect of the new rule cases which might have arisen under the prior law; that is cases of persons who had taken possession of and undertaken to reclaim unsurveyed lands at a time when the law conferred the right to do so. Any such person, no less than one who acted subsequently, is within the words of the proviso. He is literally 'a person who has, prior to survey, taken possession,' etc. The proviso so construed impairs no vested right and brings into existence no new obligation which affects any private interest. No reason is perceived why the words employed should not be given their natural application and so applied the case of appellee is included. Indeed, this does not give the proviso a retroactive operation. The language in terms applies to one who at the time of the enactment occupied a particular status, viz. the status of a person who has done the things enumerated. A statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation. Reg. v. Inhabitants of St. Mary, Whitechapel, 12 Queen's Bench Reports, 120, 127; United States v. Trans- Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 342\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540. \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n Passing this point, however, it is contended that the lands in question were in fact surveyed. It is true the lands had been surveyed in 1854-56, but the lines of that survey by the year 1900 had disappeared to such a degree that for practical purposes they had become nonexistent. A survey of public lands does not ascertain boundaries; it creates them. Robinson v. Forrest, 29 Cal. 317, 325; Sawyer v. Gray (D. C.) 205 Fed. 160, 163. Hence the running of lines in the field and the laying out and platting of townships, sections and legal subdivisions are not alone sufficient to constitute a survey. Until all conditions as to filing in the proper land office and all requirements as to approval have been complied with, the lands are to be regarded as unsurveyed and not subject to disposal as surveyed lands. United States v. Morrison, \n240 \nU.S. 192, 210\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 326; United States v. Curtner (C. C.) 38 Fed. 1, 10. It follows that, although the survey may have been physically made, if it be disapproved by the duly authorized administrative officers the lands which are the subject of the survey are still to be classified as unsurveyed. In other words, to justify the application of the term 'surveyed' to a body of public land something is required beyond the completion of the field work and the consequent laying out of the boundaries, and that something is the filing of the plat and the approval of the work of the surveyor. If, pending such approval, or, still more, if after disapproval of the survey, the lands in contemplation of law are unsurveyed, it is difficult to see why the same result may not follow when the survey originally approved and platted is subsequently annulled or abandoned, because the lines and marks established have become obliterated. A purpose to annul or abandon such survey we think may be disclosed by an act of Congress directing a resurvey plainly based upon the fact of such obliteration.\n Turning now to the record in the case under consideration it appears that the lines and marks of the original \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n survey of 1854-56 had for all practical purposes ceased to be. This is apparent not only from a consideration of the record but is in accord with repeated declarations of the land department. See In re Peterson et al., 40 Land Dec. 562, 566, 570, where it is said not only that all the corners which had been established north of the fourth standard parallel were missing, but that the survey itself was 'grossly inaccurate'; that in making the resurvey an attempt to retrace the old original survey, had failed, 'and it is now a physical impossibility to identify' the corners of sections 16 and 36 'according to the original survey. ... All vestiges of that survey have been wiped away.' See, also, Stephenson v. Pashgian, 42 Land Dec. 113, 114. In the land office contest between the parties hereto for the land in controversy the Secretary of the Interior, although ruling in favor of appellant, stated that the description of the land by reference to the lines of the old survey 'was an impossible condition.' Hart v. Cox, 42 Land Dec. 592, 594. Both courts below reached the same conclusion.\n The District Court said:\n'The evidence of the survey of 1856 upon the ground in that vast area covered by said act had become useless, by reason of the fact that the lines of the survey were obliterated, and all that was left were some prominent monuments. This act [the resurvey act] recognized that the survey of 1856 was of no practical use and that the lands were, for all practical purposes, unsurveyed lands. It was impracticable to dispose of these lands by congressional subdivision according to the survey of 1856.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, after referring to the original survey and the fact that no settlement was made until nearly 50 years later, said:\n'It was then found that the marks of the survey had so far been obliterated that it was practically impossible to locate the lines thereof.' Cox v. Hart, 270 Fed. 51.\n\n From the foregoing it results, and we hold, that the Resurvey Act of 1902 was in effect and intent a legislative \n\n[260 U.S. 427, 438]\n\u00a0\n declaration that the lands therein described were, when the act was passed and for all purposes of settlement and sale, unsurveyed lands. With the disappearance of the physical evidences the old survey survived only as an historical event. As a tangible, present fact it ceased to exist, and a new survey became necessary to re-establish the status of the area over which it had extended as surveyed lands of the United States.\n The decree below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRANE v. HAHLO(1922)\nNo. 107\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John M. Harrington, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles J. Nehrbas, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pursuant to authority of an act of the Legislature of the state, the city of New York, in 1890, began the construction of an elevated viaduct in 155th street, which was completed in 1893. Before and during the construction of the viaduct George W. Sauer, the intestate of the plaintiff in error, was the owner of property fronting upon the part of the street improved and in due time instituted suit to recover damages, which he claimed he had suffered. After many vicissitudes, sufficiently indicated in Sauer v. City of New York, \n206 U.S. 536\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 686, and People ex rel. Crane v. Ormond, 221 N. Y. 283, 116 N. E. 993, the litigation resulted in a decision by the Court of Appeals of New York in 1917, that the construction of the viaduct effected a change of grade in the street, that the administratrix of Sauer's estate was entitled to recover such damages as had been caused to the property, and that the board of assessors of the city of New York had jurisdiction to make award of such damages. 221 N. Y. 283, 116 N. E. 993, supra.\n With the right to damages thus established, the plaintiff in error in due time filed her claim with the board of assessors and was awarded a substantial sum as compensation. While her claim for damages was pending with the board of assessors the 'Greater New York Charter' was amended in many respects affecting the powers and \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n duties of the board of assessors and of the board of revision of assessments. Laws of New York 1918, c. 619. The comptroller, corporation counsel, and president of the department of taxes and assessments of the city had constituted the board of revision of assessments since 1901, and as such were given power to review any award of damages made by the board of assessors, and the only essential change made by the amendment of 1918 consisted in the provision that:\n'The confirmation of any such award by the board of revision of assessments shall be final and conclusive upon all parties and persons whomsoever, with respect to the amount of damage sustained.'\n\n The plaintiff in error, not being satisfied with the amount of the award in her favor by the board of assessors, filed objections thereto, which were overruled, and thereupon, pursuant to law, the proposed award with the objections was presented to the board of revision of assessments and was by it confirmed.\n The plaintiff in error, continuing dissatisfied, thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of New York for, and procured, a writ of certiorari to review the determination of the award by the board of assessors and the confirmation of it by the board of revision of assessments. The ground of this application was that the quoted provision of the act of the New York Legislature of 1918, making the confirmation of the award by the board of revision of assessments final and conclusive 'with respect to the amount of damages sustained,' was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and void, and that the right to such review by certiorari theretofore existing was not affected by it.\n A motion by the city to dismiss the writ on the ground that plaintiff in error's right to it was cut off by the amendment to the statute was denied by the Supreme Court and by the Appellate Division of the Supreme \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n Court, but this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeals in the judgment which is now under review.\n It is conceded that at the time the viaduct was erected and until the act of 1918, under the practice of New York, the plaintiff in error had the right to a general review in the Supreme Court, a court of general jurisdiction, of the proceedings before the board of assessors until 1901 and of the board of revision of assessments until the amendment in 1918. The holding of the Court of Appeals in this case is that the provision of the act making the confirmation of the award by the Board of Revision of Assessments final and conclusive would not prevent 'the consideration on certiorari of questions of jurisdiction, fraud and willful misconduct on the part of the officials composing the board,' but that it was conclusive against the right to a general review of questions relating to the subject of damages such as the plaintiff in error was presenting to it. In the Matter of Southern Boulevard Railroad Co., etc., 143 N. Y. 253, 259, 38 N. E. 276, is cited as a precedent for this holding.\n Thus the contention of the plaintiff in error, pursued through all the state courts and now presented to this court, is that the modification by the act of 1918 of the remedy available to her intestate when the viaduct was constructed and his right to damages became complete offends: ( 1) Against the contract impairment clause (article 1,  10); (2) against the equal protection clause; and (3) against the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n As to the first of these contentions:\n While, under the holdings in Crane v. Ormond, 221 N. Y. 283, 116 N. E. 993, and Ettor v. City of Tacoma, \n228 U.S. 148\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 428, the decedent of the plaintiff in error had a vested property right to compensation after the completion of the viaduct, very clearly this was not a contract right in a constitutional sense. \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n It has long been settled by decisions of this court that the word 'contracts' in section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution is used in its usual or popular sense as signifying an agreement of two or more minds, upon sufficient consideration, to do or not to do certain acts. 'Mutual assent [express or implied] to its terms is of its very essence.' State of Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v. Mayor and Administrators of New Orleans, \n109 \nU.S. 285, 288\n, 3 S. Sup.

Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co., \n146 \nU.S. 162, 169\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 54; Garrison v. New York, 21 Wall. 196, 203.\n The Court of Appeals held that at common law the intestate of the plaintiff in error did not have any right of action for the damage done to his property (Sauer v. City of New York, 180 N. Y. 27, 72 N. E. 579, 70 L. R. A. 717), and this court affirmed that judgment in \n206 U.S. 536\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 686, supra. In the later case, 221 N. Y. 283, 116 N. E. 993, supra, by treating the construction of the viaduct as a change of grade of the street, a statute (not noticed in the earlier decision) was made applicable and from it was derived the right to recover asserted in this case. The origin of the right is thus wholly statutory, an act of grace by the Legislature, as if 'consulting the interests of morality,' so that there is nothing in the nature of a contract in it, and therefore there is nothing in the case for the contract impairment clause of the Constitution to operate upon. The first contention of the plaintiff in error cannot be sustained.\n The statement of the case shows that, stripped of nonessentials, the second contention of the plaintiff in error is that the cutting down by the amendment of 1918 of her remedy from a general review in the state Supreme Court to a review limited to 'questions of jurisdiction, fraud and willful misconduct on the part of officials composing the board' deprived her of her property without due process of law. \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n In determining whether or not due process of law has been denied, regard must always be had to the character of the proceeding involved for the purpose of determining what the practice at common law was and what the practice in this country has been in like cases. Twining v. State of New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 100\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 14.\n The right of the plaintiff in error to damages having been established by the decision in 221 N. Y. 283, 116 N. E. 993, supra, there remained only the problem of determining the amount of the award which should be made and the manner of making it, and the reference of such a question, especially in eminent domain proceedings, to a commission, or board, or sheriff's jury, or other nonjudicial tribunal, was so common in England and in this country prior to the adoption of the federal Constitution that it has been held repeatedly that it is a form of procedure within the power of the state to provide, and that, when opportunity to be heard is given, it satisfies the requirements of due process of law, especially when, as in this case, a right of review in the courts is given.

Ct. 966.\n No one has a vested right in any given mode of procedure (Railroad Co. v. Grant, \n98 U.S. 398\n, 401; Gwin v. United States, \n184 \nU.S. 669, 674\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 526), and so long as a substantial and efficient remedy remains or is provided due process of law is not denied by a legislative change (Oshkosh Waterworks Co. v. Oshkosh, \n187 \nU.S. 437, 439\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 234).\n The amendment of 1918, following an earlier amendment in 1901, gave to the plaintiff in error the right to have the award of the board of assessors reviewed by the board of review of assessments, which her intestate did not have when the viaduct was constructed, and, while the \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n amendment of 1918 made the finding of the latter conclusive as to the 'amount of damages sustained,' it retained the right to review in the courts the entire finding whenever lack of jurisdiction, or fraud, or willful misconduct on the part of the members of the board should be asserted. This afforded ample protection for the fundamental rights of the plaintiff in error, and the taking away of the right to have examined mere claims of honest error in the conduct of the proceeding by the board did not invade any federal constitutional right. Even courts have been known to make rulings thought by counsel to be erroneous. McGovern v. City of New York, \n229 U.S. 363\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 876, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 391.\n The Court of Appeals declares that the theory of the amendment is well understood to be 'the policy that the greater good is sometimes secured by making certain classes of decisions final and ending litigation, even though in a particular case the individual is prevented by review from correcting some error which has injured him.'\n It may not be an undiluted evil to the real parties in interest to this litigation, which has been pending in various forms for nearly 30 years, to have it brought to an end and to have the large award allowed in 1918 divided among them.\n Plainly this second claim of the plaintiff in error must be denied.\n The final contention is that the amendment of 1918 to the act denies to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws.\n It is argued far from confidently, that this invasion of constitutional right arises from the fact that the board of revision of assessments, having final jurisdiction over the amount of the damages suffered by the intestate of the plaintiff in error, is composed of three city officials, appointed by the mayor, with power to pass on claims against it and that this denies to her an impartial tribunal. This membership of the board had existed since 1901. \n\n[258 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n The disposition of this contention by the Court of Appeals is quite sufficient, saying:\n'The officials who heard her claim were not disqualified because selected by the city. Her claim was not against the city, but, if allowed, was collected by assessment. Officials acting really as an auditing board are not condemned because they have been selected by the municipality or other division against which the claim is made. If it were otherwise, a great many bodies passing in a judicial capacity on claims from the board of claims down would be disqualified.'\n\n The judgment of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, of the state of New York entered on remittitur from the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRITCHTON v. WINGFIELD(1922)\nNo. 312\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Opinion Modified on Rehearing April 17, 1922. \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Cutrer, of Clarksdale, Miss., and Thomas B. Felder, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Marshall and James Marshall, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a citizen of the state of New York and a resident of the Southern District thereof, brought this suit \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n in the District Court of the United States against the appellee, a citizen of the state of Mississippi, residing in the city of Clarksdale, county of Coahoma, in that state. Appellant is the daughter of Ephraim H. and Eva W. Lombard; appellee is a sister of Ephraim H. Lombard. From the bill it appears that a controversy arose concerning the ownership of certain notes, 14 in number, executed by W. D. Corley at Clarksdale, Miss., on January 1, 1917, and made payable to Eva W. and E. H. Lombard, or bearer, at the Bank of Clarksdale, Clarksdale, Miss. Seven of the notes were for $31,480 each, and 7 were interest notes given for sums aggregating $39,664.80. The bill alleges that these notes were held in the state of New York within the jurisdiction of the District Court. From the bill it appears that appellant claims to own the notes by bequests under the wills of Eva W. and E. H. Lombard, respectively.\n The complaint sets forth that E. H. Lombard when in feeble health executed a certain paper assigning one-half of all the principal notes, numbered from 4 to 9 inclusive, and one-half of the interest notes, numbered from 4 to 9 inclusive, to the appellee. The notes are alleged to be deferred payments on the sale of a plantation in the state of Mississippi. It is set out that at the time of the alleged assignment to appellee E. H. Lombard was of unsound mind, memory and understanding, and incapable of executing the assignment; that the same was obtained by the appellee by undue influence exercised upon appellant's father; and that it was without consideration. The assignment is alleged to constitute a cloud upon appellant's title to the notes in controversy. The notes are secured by deeds of trust upon real estate conveyed in Mississippi, which are duly recorded in the record of mortgages and trust deeds in that state.\n The appellee could not be served with process in the southern district of New York, and an order was made \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n under section 57 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1039) for service. Service was made upon the appellee at Clarksdale, Miss. She thereupon made special appearance for the purpose of a motion to quash the service upon the ground that she is a resident, citizen, and inhabitant of the state of Mississippi and had not been within the New York district; and she moved for a dismissal of the bill. Upon hearing the District Court sustained the motion, set aside the service, and dismissed the bill.\n The question here only concerns the jurisdiction of the District Court. There is much controversy in the record, embodied in affidavits, as to the manner in which possession of the notes was obtained by the appellant, and the assignment made to the appellee. So far as we deem them necessary to be considered, the facts are: The notes are secured by deeds of trust on lands in Mississippi. It appears without contradiction that Eva W. Lombard, the mother, died May 25, 1919. Upon petition of appellant the will was admitted to probate and she was appointed and qualified as executrix in the chancery court of Mississippi. The decree in the chancery court finds that the last will and testament was fully and legally established as the last will of Eva W. Lombard, who at the time of her death was a resident of Coahoma county, Miss.; that the lands devised by the will are situated in Bronxville, N. Y., and that the personal property bequeathed by the will is all located in the second district of Coahoma county, Miss., the place of residence of the deceased at the time of her death. It was before the qualification of appellant as executrix under her mother's will that she took the notes to New York.\n After the death of her father, which occurred in New York after the death of the mother, appellant filed a petition in the chancery court of Mississippi, and a decree was entered upon her petition, establishing the last will and testament of her father. In that decree there are \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n findings like those establishing the will of her mother, namely, that her father was at the time of his death a resident of Coahoma county Miss.; that the personal property bequeathed and devised by the will is located in the second district of Coahoma county, Miss., the place of residence of decedent at the time of his death. The decree established the last will and testament of E. H. Lombard, admitted the same to probate, and appointed the appellant executrix.\n It further appears that neither of the estates had been settled in the chancery court of Mississippi, the court of probate, and as to both administration was pending when this suit was brought. From these recitals it appears that by the decrees of probate, invoked and obtained by the appellant, it was found that the decedents had been and were residents of Coahoma county, Miss., and that the personal property bequeathed under each will was located in the second district of that county, and hence subject to the jurisdiction of the court of probate.\n By a law of Mississippi, set forth in the record (section 2102, Code of Mississippi), it is provided that an executor or administrator shall not remove any of the property of the estate out of the state, and the court is authorized, when it appears that the property is about to be removed, to issue a precept to the sheriff, commanding him to seize the same and hold it until legally disposed of, and the letters of such executor or administrator may be revoked, on due notice, and administration de bonis non granted to some other person, and suit may be instituted by creditors or distributees of the estate on the bond, and judgment rendered accordingly.\n With these facts beyond dispute, did section 57 of the Judicial Code, authorizing service in Mississippi, call upon the respondent to answer in the District Court in New York, where the notes were physically held, and there litigate the controversy which had arisen concerning them? \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n Section 57 provides:\n'When in any suit commenced in any District Court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon or claim to, or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of or found within the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to make an order directing such absent defendant or defendants to appear, plead, answer, or demur by a day certain to be designated, which order shall be served on sucy absent defendant or defendants, if practicable, wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of said property, if any there be; or where such personal service upon such absent defendant or defendants is not practicable, such order shall be published in such manner as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks. In case such absent defendant shall not appear, plead, answer, or demur within the time so limited, or within some further time, to be allowed by the court, in its discretion, and upon proof of the service or publication of said order and of the performance of the directions contained in the same, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the hearing and adjudication of such suit in the same manner as if such absent defendant had been served with process within the said district; but said adjudication shall, as regards said absent defendant or defendants, without appearance, effect only the property which shall have been the subject of the suit and under the jurisdiction of the court therein, within such district; and when a part of the said real or personal property against which such proceedings shall be taken shall be within another district, but within the same state, such suit may be brought in either district in said state. ...' \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n The purpose of this section is to authorize service of process in suits to remove clouds upon title, liens, and incumbrances, upon property within the district, by bringing in adverse claimants who cannot be reached by the ordinary methods of personal service. The language used is primarily applicable to titles to realty. It is true that the statute also embraces personal property. Used in this connection, personal property undoubtedly refers to such as is lawfully localized within the district, and there held and enjoyed, and thus made subject to the court's jurisdiction to clear its title from clouds and liens, notwithstanding personal service within the district cannot be obtained upon those setting up adverse interests. It is the presence of property real or personal within the district which confers the limited jurisdiction conferred in section 57 upon the District Court. Chase v. Wetzlar, \n225 U.S. 79\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 659.\n\n This court had occasion to consider the statute in Jellenik v. Huron Copper Mining Co., \n177 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 559, where it was held, in a sult involving title to shares of stock, that foreign service might be obtained in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Michigan on adverse claimants to bring in certain alleged owners of shares of stock held by Massachusetts defendants. This was held to be so because the company was organized under the laws of Michigan whose statutes declared that the stock of the company was to be deemed to be personal property. For the purpose of the suit it was decided that the property was within the state of Michigan as the habitation or domicile of the company was within that state, which created the corporation, and made the property subject to its laws.\n The appellant insists that the principles declared in that case control here, and cites statutes of New York and Mississippi defining personal property in terms broad enough to include written instruments creating pecuniary \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n obligations. The appellant also relies upon cases decided in this court, such as Wheeler and Howland, Executors, v. Sohmer, \n233 U.S. 434\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 607, in which it was held that the New York inheritance tax, imposed upon the transfer of property within the state, belonging to a nonresident thereof, was not void under the due process clause of the federal Constitution as applied to promissory notes held in a nonresident's safety deposit box in New York. In discussing the character of such property we held that the state might tax such notes as property having a local situs within its borders. In De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 U.S. 376\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 524, this court sustained a federal tax upon the income from stock, bonds, and mortgages owned by alien nonresidents, but in the hands of an agent in this county, with full authority over them. In that case, as in the Wheeler Case, the previous decisions in this court were cited, which have held that notes, bonds, and mortgages may acquire a situs at a place other than the domicile of the owner, and be reached and taxed as localized property by the taxing authority.\n We have no disposition to depart from the principle of those cases, but are of opinion that they do not control the present controversy. In our view section 57 of the Judicial Code cannot, under the facts of this case, be made the basis of a departure from statutory enactments which require personal service within the district in order to subject a person to the jurisdiction of a federal court.\n In this cause the appellant derives her title, as she sets forth in her bill, from the bequests made to her by her father and mother which, subject to the settlement of the estates, would give her title to the notes in controversy. Upon her petition she was appointed executrix of the wills. Upon her representation as to residence of decedents she obtained letters testamentary in each of the estates. The decree of probate declared the personal property to be within the jurisdiction of the Mississippi court. A statute of the state forbade its removal beyond the \n\n[258 U.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n borders of the state. These estates at the time the bill was filed remained open and unsettled. Under such circumstances it would be doing violence to the purpose and provisions of section 57 to hold that the mere physical presence of the notes in New York, complainant having seen fit to take them there, made them personal property of that localized character lawfully within the Southern district of New York which would justify foreign service upon a nonresident and bring him or her to the local jurisdiction to contest title to the notes.\n While the District Court put its decision upon different grounds, we are of opinion that it rightly held that a case for foreign service was not made out, and did not err in setting aside the service, and dismissing the bill.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUMBERLAND TEL & TEL CO. v.

Long, of Shreveport, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by the appellees to set aside the supersedeas and injunction granted by District Judge Foster at the time he allowed an appeal from an order of three judges, Circuit Judge Bryan, District Judge Clayton, and himself, denying an application for an interlocutory injunction under section 266 of the Judicial Code. (Comp. St.  1243).\n The original bill was filed by the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company against the Louisiana Public Service Commission seeking an injunction to prevent the latter, a state board of competent authority, from reducing the existing telephone rates, as it proposed, on the ground that such action would compel the plaintiff to furnish service at rates which would be confiscatory and violate its rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. District Judge Foster granted a restraining order as permitted by section 266, to remain in force until the application for an interlocutory injunction could be heard by three judges. The court, thus constituted, heard the application on voluminous evidence, and denied the application, Judge Foster dissenting. Upon the entry of the order, the complainant applied to the District Court for an appeal and for an injunction against the defendant commission, until the determination of the cause on appeal. District \n\n[260 U.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n Judge Foster, sitting alone, made an order in the District Court allowing the appeal, granted a supersedeas, and continued the original restraining order, made by him before the hearing by the three judges, until the appeal could be determined, in order to maintain the status quo. A bond was required in $100,000, which is conditioned that appellant shall prosecute its appeal to effect and answer all damages and costs if it fails to make its plea good, and also that it shall repay to defendants such damages as they may suffer, and-\n'for repayment to plaintiff's subscribers and to each of them of the excess charges collected from each of said subscribers as a result of the issuance and continuance of the preliminary restraining order issued herein, over and above what would have been collected from said subscribers had said restraining order not been rendered, the said payment to be made as, when, and if it shall have been finally determined herein that the order of the Louisiana Public Service Commission of May 13, 1922, is a legal order binding upon the plaintiff herein.'\n\n The present motion is to set aside the supersedeas and the restraining order. That was the form of the application in the original proceeding for mandamus, which by order of the court has been treated in argument as a motion on this appeal. So far as the supersedeas to which the motion is directed, is concerned, it had no effect, because there was nothing to supersede, except an execution for costs, and that was suspended by the mere allowance of the appeal. There was no decree for money, there was no decree at all in favor of the complainants upon which execution could issue. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 160\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 136.

The effective part of the order of Judge Foster, if valid, was the continuance of the restraining order, which is called in the motion and argument the injuncrion. The motion to set this aside must be granted.\n Section 266 of the Judicial Code is a codification of section 17 of the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 557, amended by the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013. The legislation was enacted for the manifest purpose of taking away the power of a single United States judge, whether District Judge, Circuit Judge, or Circuit Justice holding a District Court of the United States, to issue an interlocutory injunction against the execution of a state statute by a state officer or of an order of an administrative board of the state pursuant to a state statute, on the ground of the federal unconstitutionality of the statute. Pending the application for an interlocutory injunction, a single judge may grant a restraining order to be in force until the hearing of the application, but thereafter, so far as enjoining the state officers, his power is exhausted. The wording of the section leaves no doubt that Congress was by provisions ex industria seeking to make interference by interlocutory injunction from a federal court with the enforcement of state legislation regularly enacted and in course of execution, a matter of the adequate hearing and the full deliberation which the presence of three judges, one of whom should be a Circuit Justice of Judge, was likely to secure. It was to prevent the improvident granting of such injunctions by a single judge, and the possible unnecessary conflict between federal and state authority always to be deprecated. This court had occasion to consider the purport and significance of section 17 of the Act of June 18, 1910, embodied in section 266, in Ex parte Metropolitan Water Co. of West Virginia, \n220 U.S. 539\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 600, and there held that after a District Judge had granted a preliminary \n\n[260 U.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n restraining order in such a case as provided, the same judge could not set aside his own order, and such act by him was without jurisdiction. This court, therefore, issued a mandamus directing him to annul the order of vacation. We are of opinion that a single judge has no power, in view of section 266, to affect the operation of the order of the court constituted by the three judges granting or denying the interlocutory injunction applied for. To hold that he may grant a temporary injunction varying the order of the three judges would be to make the ligislation a nullity and work the result which Congress was at great pains to avoid. Arguments to show that the order only continued the status quo, that a disturbance of it will work irreparable injury and that the bond herein required secures all parties in interest are beside the point. This is a question of statutory power and jurisdiction, not one of judicial discretion or equitable consideration.\n Equity rule No. 74 (33 Sup. Ct. xxxix) which authorizes a justice or judge who took part in a decision of an equity suit granting or dissolving an injunction to make an order suspending, modifying, or restoring the injunction pending the appeal upon proper terms, does not apply to such an appeal or to such a case as this. This appeal is not from a final decree. It is a special proceeding, in which the power of a single judge is definitely limited.\n It is argued that the order of injunction pending the appeal here was the act of the court of three judges. It is certain that Judge Foster was the only judge sitting in the District Court when the ex parte application was made by complainant company for the allowance of the appeal, the granting of the injunction, and the fixing of the amount of the bond. It is certain that these orders were signed only by him, and did not purport to be authorized by three judges. The claim is based on a quotation from remarks made by Judge Foster in overruling the application made to him by the defendant, the Public \n\n[260 U.S. 212, 218]\n\u00a0\n Service Commission, to set aside the injunction. The judge said:\n'Now let us go a little further. Here is a question submitted to three judges, let us say. This is not the action of an individual judge. The question of supersedeas was a matter of discussion among the court composed of Judge Bryan, Judge Clayton, and myself, and I showed you, Mr. Long (counsel for the Public Commission), Judge Bryan's letter in which he says that he thought the Cumberland Telephone Company would be entitled to a supersedeas in this case, but that was a matter to be taken up by the District Court, by myself.\n\n'Now, when I granted an appeal with supersedeas, that is the action of the court, it is merely a matter of practice that I signed the order. Now that supersedeas ought always to be granted to prevent irreparable injury.'\n\n This statement does not make the order here in question the act of the three judges. John Bryan's letter, so far as we are able to judge from this reference, was a mere expression of opinion that Judge Foster, as District Judge, had the power to grant the injunction, an opinion with which we do not agree. The letter was not an attempt by Judge Bryan to become a participant in the order. Nor is there any showing that Judge Clayton took part in the matter. A discussion in conference of the judges as to the granting of an injunction pending an appeal, before it was applied for, does not supply what is needed to give efficacy to such order by a single judge. Compliance with the statute requires the assent of the three judges given after the application is made, evidenced by their signatures or an announcement in open court with three judges sitting, followed by a formal order tested as they direct. Notice of application for the injunction to opposing counsel should be required, except in extraordinary circumstances. We have no proper evidence of the participation of the three judges in the injunction here, and therefore grant the \n\n[260 U.S. 212, 219]\n\u00a0\n motion to set it aside as void and made without jurisdiction.\n The appellees ask that, if we conclude to set aside the injunction, we entertain a motion to grant one now to preserve the status quo. The fact that a majority of the three judges of the District Court denied the interlocutory injunction suggests the want of merit in the application here. We, of course, appreciate that, notwithstanding a denial of an injunction on its merits, a court may properly find that pending a final determination of the suit on the merits in a court of last resort, a balance of convenience may be best secured by maintaining the status quo and securing an equitable adjustment of the finally adjudicated rights of all concerned through the conditions of a bond. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 136; equity rule No. 74. But the court which is best and most conveniently able to exercise the nice discretion needed to determine this balance of convenience is the one which has considered the case on its merits, and therefore is familiar with the record. Records in cases like this are often very voluminous. Such is the record in this case. Without abdicating our unquestioned power to grant such an application as this, and conceding that exceptional cases may arise, we are generally inclined to refer applications of this kind to the court of three judges who have heard the whole matter, have read the record, and can pass on the issue without additional labor. That was the course taken by this court in Southern Railway Co. v. Watts, \n259 U.S. 576\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 585 (No. 927, October Term, 1921, per curiam, decided May 29, 1922). A similar order will be made here. The action of the District Court thus constituted, however, will not revive or vitalize the order of injunction granted by Judge Foster, for that was void, and the parties affected by it must be left to such course as they may be advised. We are not now called upon to construe or determine the validity or effect of the bond taken in that proceeding. \n\n[260 U.S. 212, 220]\n\u00a0\n The orders in this court will be two:\n First. The motion of appellees is granted and the order of injunction granted by Judge Foster when allowing the appeal is set aside as without jurisdiction.\n Second. The application to this court for an injunction maintaining the status quo is referred to the District Court, constituted of three judges, for its determination.\n The costs on this motion will be taxed to the appellant. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUNNINGHAM v. RODGERS(1922)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Clinton Robb, George F. Curtis, and Leonard J. Mather, all of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error. \n\n[257 U.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Section 1697, U. S. Revised Statutes, as amended by Act of December 21, 1898, c. 36, 30 Stat. 770 (Comp. St.  3149), requires every consul general, before receiving his commission, to execute a bond conditioned for the true and faithful performance of duties lawfully imposed upon him as such officer. It is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Purporting to proceed under this section plaintiff in error brought an action in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, against James Linn Rodgers, once consul \n\n[257 U.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n general at Shanghai, China, and the sureties upon his official bond. Process was served upon him, but the sureties were not summoned and did not appear. The declaration alleges execution of the bond, its breach by Rodgers' failure to discharge his official duties concerning property left by plaintiff's brother, who died in China, June 10, 1905, and asks a recovery upon the bond for damages suffered. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the declaration and upon appeal this action was affirmed.\n The Court of Appeals held that if the consul general's failure to perform his official duties concerning the personal property caused loss, the damage was to the estate, and plaintiff, being a mere possible owner of a distributive share, could not recover in his own right-any possible right of action was in the administrator. This we think was clearly right.\n The second count of the painfully prolix declaration alleges:\n'That there was left by said decedent certain valuable real property in the Pao Shan district in Shanghai, China, of the value of, to wit, $ 5,000, which, outstanding in decedent's name in the land records of said United States consulate at Shanghai, China, it was the duty of the said defendant James Linn Rodgers to conserve to said decedent's estate; but notwithstanding his said duty in this respect, and in utter violation thereof, and in breach of the condition of his said bond and writing obligatory, he, the said defendant James Linn Rodgers, instructed one E. H. Dunning to convey and transfer the same over to a certain Mrs. Green gratuitously, and without any consideration passing therefor, four days after he had illegally and improperly granted alleged letters testamentary to the said E. H. Dunning, ... that no such real estate was devised or sought to be devised under the paper writing hereinbefore referred to as the pretended last will and testament of the said Henry H. Cunningham, deceased, ... and said \n\n[257 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n assumption of a jurisdiction and power to so instruct the said E. H. Dunning was wholly illegal and void, although having the effect of dissipating a valuable part of plaintiff's deceased brother's estate, to the consequent loss of plaintiff by this said defendant James Linn Rodgers' violation and breach of the condition of his bond and writing obligatory, so as aforesaid given to insure plaintiff all legal and proper protection of his said interests in and to his deceased brother's estate as aforesaid.'\n\n The plaintiff's whole cause is presented upon the theory that Rodgers had no power to administer the estate of the deceased brother or to do aught in reference thereto but what the statutes authorized, 'namely, conserve and transmit to the United States for proper and legal distribution according to the laws of decedent's domicile.' No statute is cited which imposes any duty in respect of real estate upon a consul in China. Under such circumstances mere allegation that defendant unlawfully assumed to instruct one holding void letters testamentary to transfer such property without consideration is wholly insufficient to show an actionable breach of official duty, or adequately to point out personal damage suffered by plaintiff in error. Real estate cannot be dissipated by mere direction gratuitously to convey it issued without semblance of authority. The judgment below is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec 1697.

DAVIS(1922)\nNo. 166\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n Walter C. Clephane and J. Wilmer Latimer, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. A. McLaughlin, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a railway mail clerk in the employ of the United States, was injured on May 29, 1918, when the car in which he was working was wrecked on the line of the Illinois Central Railroad, then being operated by the Director General of Railroads under the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918 (40 Stat. 451, c. 25, Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p). He brought this suit to recover for his injuries against the Illinois Central Railroad Company and the Director General of Railroads, but the former was dismissed from the case on demurrer. Among other defenses, the Director General of Railroads alleged in his answer that the petitioner, as an employee of the United States, had made application for, and pursuant to its provisions had been paid, compensation under the provisions of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (39 Stat. 742, Comp. St.  8932a-8932uu), and that thereby this further action, which is, in effect, against the United States, was barred. A demurrer to this last defense was sustained and the petitioner obtained a verdict on which the District Court entered judgment. On error this judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that court holding that the petitioner had his option under the law to apply for compensation under the Employees' Compensation Act, as he did, or to sue for damages under the Federal Control Act (40 Stat. 451, c. 25), and that, by electing to accept the benefits of the former, he was barred from prosecuting this action for negligence against the United States under the latter.\n Thus, the writ of certiorari brings up for review the question whether, when a government employee, injured on a railroad, operated at the time by the Director General \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n of Railroads, had elected to accept payment under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, he was thereby barred from prosecuting a suit against the Director General of Railroads for negligence causing the injury for which he had been compensated.\n James C. Davis, the Agent designated by the President under section 206 of the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456), has been substituted for the Director General of Railroads as respondent.\n It was definitely held in Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593, that, at all of the times here involved, section 10 of the Federal Control Act permitted the government, through its Director General of Railroads, to be sued for any injury negligently caused on any line of railway in his custody, precisely as a common carrier corporation operating such road might have been sued, and that recovery, if any, would be from the United States.\n Thus, plainly the petitioner had the right to sue the Director General of Railroads for negligently injuring him, and if successful his recovery must have been from the United States.\n The Federal Employees' Compensation Act, approved September 7, 1916 ( 39 Stat. p. 742, c. 458), provides that the United States shall thereafter pay, as therein specified, for the disability or death of any government employee resulting from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty. The act provides for a commission to investigate claims and to make awards, but no compensation may be allowed to any person unless he, or some one in his behalf, shall make written claim therefor. Thus, the petitioner, injured, as he was, while in the performance of his duty, was entitled to compensation under the act upon making claim for it.\n This reference to the two acts shows that the petitioner had two remedies, each for the same wrong, and both against the United States, and therefore the question for decision takes the form, May the petitioner after having pursued one of his remedies to a conclusion and payment, \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n pursue the other for a second satisfaction of the same wrong against the government.\n That this question must be answered in the negative we think clear from various provisions in the Compensation Act, showing that Congress intended that payments made under it should be regarded as full and final and that no payment in addition thereto would be made by the government to an injured employee.\n Section 7 of the act specifically declares that so long as any employee is receiving installment payments under the act, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments then until the expiration of the period during which installment payments would have continued, 'he shall not receive from the United States any salary, pay or remuneration whatsoever except in return for services actually performed,' and except pensions for service in the Army or Navy.\n It would be difficult to frame a clearer declaration than this that no payment would be made by the government for injuries received other than as provided for in the act.\n Section 26 provides 'that if an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this act is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability upon some person other than the United States to pay damages therefor' the Commission may require an assignment to it of the right to enforce such liability or to share in any money received in satisfaction thereof, or it may require the beneficiary to prosecute an action for damages in his own name. Refusal to make such assignment or to prosecute such action, when requested by the Commission, shall forfeit all right to compensation. This section also provides that if the commission shall realize on such claim against third persons, either by suit or settlement, it shall apply the net proceeds to reimbursing the 'Employees' Compensation Fund' for payments \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 430]\n\u00a0\n theretofore made, and any surplus remaining shall be paid to the beneficiary and credited on future compensation payable for the same injury. If the amount of recovery exceeded the payments made and to be made, obviously the beneficiary would be entitled to the excess.\n Section 27 also provides for cases in which death or injury, for which compensation is payable under the act, is caused under circumstances 'creating a legal liability in some person other than the United States to pay damages,' but in which the beneficiary, instead of the Commission, receives the proceeds of suit or settlement. Here it is required that such beneficiary shall refund to the United States from such proceeds the amount of any compensation that has been paid to him by the government or shall credit the money so received upon any compensation payable to him for the same injury.\n Plainly by these two sections Congress deals with the liability of persons 'other than the United States' to employees entitled to compensation under the act, not for the purpose of increasing that compensation, but for the purpose of reimbursing the government for payments made and of indemnifying it against other amounts payable in the future. The sections emphasize the disposition to treat the compensation, provided for, as adequate for the injuries received, and they negative any intention on the part of the government to make further payments.\n But section 41 is even more convincing to the point we are considering. A special proviso in this section declares that if the injury or death for which compensation is payable under the act is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in the Panama Railroad Company to pay damage therefor 'no compensation shall be payable until the person' shall release to the Railroad Company any right of action he may have against it or until he assigns to the United States any rights \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 431]\n\u00a0\n which he may have to share in any money or other property received in satisfaction of such liability.\n When the Compensation Act was passed the United States was the owner of all the capital stock of the Panama Railroad Company and as such was ultimately liable for the torts of that company just as it became liable for the torts of the Director General of Railroads under the Federal Control Act, and, therefore, this manner of dealing with the liability of that company to employees negligently injured is highly persuasive as to the congressional intent.\n This Compensation Act is the expression of a slowly developed purpose on the part of the United States (1908-35 Stat. 556; 1912-37 Stat. 74; 1916-39 Stat. 742) to give compensation to its employees, who otherwise would be without remedy when injured by fault of the government, and the provisions of it which we have discussed convince us that the congressional purpose was that when the compensation was accepted no further payment should be made by the government. The act does not contemplate or provide for suits against the government. On the contrary, it is essentially an act of justice or of grace on the part of the United States, elaborately and carefully worked out, and designed to compensate, promptly, without litigation or expense, all employees injured while in discharge of duty, in an amount, which, on the average, was thought adequate and just. The amount of the award in each case is determined by a specially constituted commission, without cost to the claimant, and it is allowed wholly without regard to the negligence of the government or its employees.\n On the other hand, the right to sue the United States under the Federal Control Act, applicable to all persons alike, is on the basis of negligence, precisely as if the government were an operating common carrier corporation, \n\n[258 U.S. 421, 432]\n\u00a0\n and it is subject to all of the expense, delay and hazard usual in cases of that character. The Compensation Act deals only with, and confers rights only upon, employees of the government, who must necessarily be but a small percentage of those authorized to sue under the Federal Control Act, and it is impossible for us to conclude that Congress intended by the enactment of the latter law to allow an employee to claim and receive the compensation specially provided for him under the former and then, while enjoying that benefit, to institute suit against the government under the Federal Control Act, which might require it to make further payment for the same injury and which must, in all cases, subject it to expensive, harassing and often long protracted litigation.\n We find no language in the Federal Control Act inconsistent with the distinct expression of purpose on the part of Congress which we have found in the Compensation Act, to treat the payments under it as sufficient and final, and for the reasons stated in the discussion herein of the latter act, and because the petitioner elected to pursue to payment the remedy given him thereunder, we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that his right of action asserted in this case was barred and the judgment of that court is therefore\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. GREEN(1922)\nNo. 132\nArgued: November 28, 1922Decided: December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 349, 350]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. J. Wills, of Hattiesburg, Miss., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. W. Cassedy, of Brookhaven, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action made up of the consolidation of two suits, both brought to make the plaintiff in error liable for what is alleged to have been the wilful fna wanton killing of Jesse Green, a conductor on the line of the Gulf & Ship Island Railroad Company, by one McLendon, an engineer. The first suit, although alleging that the Railroad was a common carrier both intra and interstate, may be taken to have been brought under the State law. It was brought by the widow of Green on her own behalf and his children by her as next friend. To this the defendant pleaded in bar among other things that the plaintiffs ought not to have their action because at the time and place the parties were engaged in interstate commerce in this that the defendant and the employees named were engaged in transporting articles of commerce from and to foreign States. The second suit was brought three months later by the widow as administratrix and was intended to state a cause of action under either the law of the State or the Act of Congress as the facts should turn out. To this also there was a plea in the words that we have quoted in abridged form. The plaintiff replied denying that she ought not to have her action because at the time and place of the said injury the defendant and the deceased were engaged in interstate commerce in this that, &c., following the words of the plea. This was a plain case of what in the old pleading was called a negative pregnant; it admitted the fact and only denied the conclusion. Very probably it was intended to deny the fact, as this mode of traversing a paragraph as a whole is very \n\n[260 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n common in the present careless ways, but it did not deny it in legal effect. Directly after the second suit was brought the principal plaintiff was allowed to change the first to a suit by herself as administratrix and the two suits were consolidated on her motion. As the replication that we have mentioned seems to have been filed after the consolidation, perhaps it was regarded as going to the plea in both suits. Otherwise that in the first suit does not appear to have been put in issue. At the trial the judge ruled that the parties were engaged in interstate commerce, without objection so far as the record shows, but refused, subject to exception, to direct a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff had a verdict and judgment for $35,000, and the case then was taken to the Supreme Court.\n The Supreme Court sustained the judgment although it held that the case was governed by State law. It held that no the general principle of liability the Act of Congress (Comp. St.  8657-8665) and the law of the State (Hemingway's Code,  501) agreed. It held, however, that there were important differences between the two laws with regard to the measure of damages and otherwise and that as the case was tried under the Act of Congress, and as on the evidence the highest amount that could have been recovered under the federal act was $16,000, the plaintiff must remit all above that amount if she would retain her judgment, although under the State law she could have recovered more.\n The ground on which the Railroad Company was held was that it had negligently employed a dangerous man with notice of his characteristics, and that the killing occurred in the course of the engineer's employment. But neither allegations nor proof present the killing as done to further the master's business or as anything but a wanton and wilful act done to satisfy the temper or spite of the engineer. Whatever may be the law of Mississippi a railroad company is not liable for such an act under \n\n[260 U.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n the statutes of the United States. The only sense in which the engineer was acting in the course of his employment was that he had received an order from Green which it was his duty to obey-in other words that he did a wilful act wholly outside the scope of his employment while his employment was going on. We see nothing in the evidence that would justify a verdict unless the doctrine of respondeat superior applies.\n As we understand the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi it based its decision in part upon the assumption that liability for the engineer's act was imposed upon the defendant by both laws and this assumption would be a sufficient ground for reversing the judgment. But we should come to the same conclusion even if our understanding were shown to be wrong. As the record stands it appears to us that the case was tried upon the warranted supposition that there was no serious controversy as to the parties having been engaged in interstate commerce and for that reason the defendant paid but slight attention to proving the fact. It seems at least not improbable that the parties were so engaged. In such circumstances the defendant is not to be deprived of its rights under the law of the United States by a decision that the fact now questioned was not adequately proved. On such matters we must judge for ourselves. If there is a new trial probably the plaintiff will be allowed to dispute the character of the employment if she is so advised. See Bowen v.

Countryman, all of St. Paul, Minn., for appellants.\n Mr. George E. Wallace, of Bismarck, N. D., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Director General of Railroads and five railroad companies to enjoin the collection of a special excise tax assessed against each of the companies for the years 1918 and 1919 under a statute of North Dakota, c. 222, Laws 1919, which declares:\n'Every corporation, joint-stock company or association, now or hereafter organized under the law of any other state, the United States or a foreign country, and \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n engaged in business in the state during the previous calendar year, shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business in within the state bears to its total business or association, equivalent to 50 cents for each $1,000.00 of the capital actually invested in the transaction of business in the state: Provided, that in the case of a corporation engaged in business partly within and partly without the state, investment within the state shall be held to mean that proportion of its entire stock and bond issues which its business within and without the state, and where such within and without the state, and where such business within the state is not otherwise more easily and certainly separable from such entire business within and without the state, business within the state shall be held to mean such proportion of the entire business within and without the state, as the property of such corporation within the state bears to its entire property employed in such business both within and without the state; provided, that in the case of a railroad, telephone, telegraph, car or freight-line, express company or other common carrier, or a gas, light, power or heating company, having lines that enter into, extend out of or across the state, property within the state shall be held to mean that proportion of the entire property of such corporation engaged in such business which its mileage within the state bears to its entire mileage within and without the state. The amount of such annual tax shall in all cases be computed on the basis of the average amount of capital so invested during the preceding calendar year: Provided, that for the purpose of this tax an exemption of $10,000.00 from the amount of capital invested in the state shall be allowed: Provided, further, that this exemption shall be allowed only if such corporation, joint-stock company or association furnish to the Tax Commissioner all the information necessary to its computation.' \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n Each of the five railroad companies was subjected in the usual way to a full property tax on all of its property within the state, and that tax is not here in question. The suit relates only to the special excise tax.\n\n The companies were all organized under the laws of states other than North Dakota and all own lines of railroad extending from other states into or through that state. These lines were under federal control, and operated by the Director General during the years for which the excise tax was assessed.\n The taxing officers at first assessed the tax for the year 1918 against these companies by using in its computation the mileage ratio prescribed in the second proviso of the statute; but this court held that the tax so assessed was an unwarranted interference with interstate commerce and a taking of property without due process of law. Wallace v. Hines, \n253 U.S. 66\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 435. Thereupon the taxing officers assessed the tax for that year, and also for 1919, by using in its computation the ratio specified in the last preceding clause of the statute-that is to say, a ratio fixed by contrasting the value of the company's railroad within the state with the value of its entire railroad within and without the state.\n In the District Court the validity of the tax assessed on the new or substituted basis was challenged on the grounds (a) that as to railroad companies whose lines lie partly within and partly without the state the statute does not authorize or sanction a tax assessed on that basis; (b) that the statute imposes the tax only as a special excise on doing business in the state, and these companies were not thus engaged during the years for which the tax was assessed, their railroads being then under federal control and operated exclusively by the Director General; and (c) that an excise tax assessed against these companies on the new or substituted basis operates necessarily to burden interstate commerce and to take property \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n without due process of law, and so is in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n At an early stage in the suit three judges granted an interlocutory injunction against the enforcement of the tax; but on the final hearing, which was on bill and answer, a decree was entered dismissing the bill on the merits. The plaintiffs then sought and were allowed a direct appeal to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n The case made by the bill involved a real and substantial question under the Constitution of the United States and the amount in controversy exceeded $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, so the case plainly was cognizable in the District Court. In such a case the jurisdiction of that court, and ours in reviewing its action, extends to every question involved, whether of federal or state law, and enables the court to rest its judgment or decree on the decision of such of the questions as in its opinion effectively dispose of the case.

Cas. 1917E, 88.\n As respects the right to sue in equity, it is enough to say that in this case we find the same absence of an adequate and certain remedy at law that was found in Wallace v. Hines, supra, where the right to invoke the aid of a court of equity was sustained.\n The first of the objections made to the tax is that it was assessed on a basis which the statute does not authorize or sanction. Of course, if this be so the tax must fall, and the other objections need not be considered. The statute does not prescribe a single or unvarying basis whereon the tax shall be assessed, but designates several bases and \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n defines the particular situation in which each shall be applied. Where the business of the corporation is wholly within the state the tax is to be computed according to the 'capital actually invested' in the business. Where the business is partly within and partly without the state the computation is to be based on a proportion of the company's 'entire stock and bond issues,' which is to be taken as representing the 'investment within the state.' But the proportion is to be determined by standards which vary materially. In one situation it is to conform to the ratio of the company's business within the state to its total business, and in another to the ratio of the company's property employed in its business within the state to its entire property employed in its business wherever conducted. In the instance of railroad companies and other public utility corporations having lines partly within and partly without the state the statute specially provides that it shall conform to the ratio of the company's mileage within the state to its entire mileage. This special provision is embodied in a proviso or excepting clause which comes immediately after the clause relating to other corporations and reads as follows:\n'... Provided, that in the case of a railroad, telephone, telegraph, car or freight-line, express company or other common carrier, or a gas, light, power or heating company, having lines that enter into, extend out of or across the state, property within the state shall be held to mean that proportion of the entire property of such corporation engaged in such business which its mileage within the state bears to its entire mileage within and without the state.'\n\n This provision shows that the Legislature intended by it to put the corporations which it describes in a separate class for the purposes of the tax, to require as to them that the tax be computed and assessed on the special basis there prescribed, and to exempt them from the bases \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n applicable to other corporations. That intention hardly could have been more clearly expressed.\n True, this provision was held in Wallace v. Hines, supra, to be in conflict with constitutional limitations and indefensible as respects the railroad companies now before us; but that does not make the provision any the less a key to the intention of the Legislature, or enable the taxing officers to subject these corporations to other provisions from which the act as a whole shows the Legislature intended to except them.\n Where an excepting provision in a statute is found unconstitutional, courts very generally hold that this does not work an enlargement of the scope or operation of other provisions with which that provision was enacted, and which it was intended to qualify or restrain. The reasoning on which the decisions proceed is illustrated in State ex rel. v. Dombaugh, 20 Ohio St. 167, 174. In dealing with a contention that a statute containing an unconstitutional proviso should be construed as if the remainder stood alone, the court there said:\n'This would be to mutilate the section and garble its meaning. The legislative intention must not be confounded with the power to carry that intention into effect. To refuse to give force and vitality to a provision of law is one thing, and to refuse to read it is a very different thing. It is by a mere figure of speech that we say an unconstitutional provision of a statute is 'stricken out.' For all the purposes of construction it is to be regarded as part of the act. The meaning of the Legislature must be gathered from all they have said, as well from that which is ineffectual for want of power as from that which is authorized by law.'\n\n Here the excepting provision was in the statute when it was enacted, and there can be no doubt that the Legislature intended that the meaning of the other provisions should be taken as restricted accordingly. Only with that \n\n[257 U.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n restricted meaning did they receive the legislative sanction which was essential to make them part of the statute law of the state; and no other authority is competent to give them a larger application. Had they been enacted without the excepting provision, and had it been embodied in a subsequent amendatory act, a different situation would be presented-one in which that provision would have no bearing on the meaning or scope of the others-because an existing statute cannot be recalled or restricted by anything short of a constitutional enactment. This was recognized in Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 U.S. 312\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 124 (December 19, 1921), where, when an amendatory exception proved unconstitutional, we held that the original statute stood wholly unaffected by it.\n From what has been said it follows that to sustain the tax in question we should have to hold that the taxing officers, on finding that it could not constitutionally be assessed on the basis specially prescribed in the statute, were at liberty to assess it on another and different basis, which the statute shows was not to be applied to corporations of the class to which these railroad companies belong. Of course we cannot so hold.\n We are accordingly of opinion that the first objection to the tax is well taken, and therefore that the tax is invalid and its collection should be enjoined.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUESENBERG MOTORS CORPORATION v. U S(1922)\nNo. 80\nArgued: October 19, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 115, 116]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action in the Court of Claims against the United States for expenses in endeavoring to perform certain contracts with the United States made during the war with Germany, or for anticipated profits.\n The contracts were for aeronautical equipment for war purposes. There were a first and primary contract and seven other contracts called supplemental agreements. The latter contained modifications of the first or primary contract and each agreement contained modifications of those which preceded.\n The first or primary contract, dated November 20, 1917, provided for 500 United States standard 12-cylinder engines, sometimes referred to as Liberty engines. By an agreement dated December 11, 1917, the number was increased to 1,000. By another agreement, dated January 4, 1918, the type of motor was changed, and a motor called the Bugatti motor was substituted, and there were other agreements.\n From this general statement it will be seen that the contract and agreements are determining elements in the claims sued upon. A full recital of them, however, would extend this opinion to an embarrassing length. We shall confine ourselves, therefore, to those which we regard of determining pertinence. \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n Upon demurrer of the United States the Court of Claims decided the contractor entitled to no relief and dismissed its petition. This action is contested, and it is earnestly insisted that the contracts made time their essence and required speed and dispatch from the contractor, and demanded in their performance precedence upon all other work, involving necessarily sacrifice and expense upon the part of the contractor. And time, it is contended, being of the essence of the contracts, this necessarily implied that the United States must have done everything to permit the contractor to comply with its obligations. The government, however, was delinquent, and it is alleged that--\n'the drawings and specifications referred to in the contract (Exhibit A) as being attached thereto (but which were not in fact so attached) were furnished piecemeal from time to time, but not so as to enable the claimant to enter into quantity production; and the only work which was practicable under said contract was in making extensive alterations in the plant of claimant company to adapt it to the uses of the government for the purpose of carrying out the contract ( Exhibit A), to assemble a competent engineering staff, and to make other preparations for the performance of said contract, all of which the claimant did at great expense.'\n\n And further delinquency is charged in not performing the agreement which substituted the Bugatti motors and article 1 of the agreement is quoted as follows:\n'That, subject to all the provisions of article 1 in said contract No. 2318 contained, the contractor shall make for the government, instead of the articles described in article 1 of said contract, 2,000 Bugatti motors, and such spare parts for said motors as the government may order from time to time during the period of the construction of said motors, in accordance with specifications to follow.'\n\n The specifications were not furnished, it is said, until September 25, 1918, and that the delay was a breach of \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n the contract and the contractor is entitled to recover for the losses caused thereby.\n To this the Court of Claims answered that the contract contemplated a revision of the schedule [times of delivery] in regard to the engines. The provision to which that purpose was attributed is that--\n'In view of the present uncertain factors inherent in the articles and in the establishment of the industry of producing them, it is understood that this schedule may require revision. ...'\n\n The schedule designated June, 1918, as the month of complete production.\n Changes were provided for in another article, and by still another it was provided that if in the opinion of the Chief Signal Officer of the United States the public interests so required, the government might, upon 30 days' notice terminate the contract. And there was provision for settlement of disputes.\n Dates are important to be considered. The supplemental contract in which article 1 appears, and which adopts article 1 of the first contract, is dated January 4, 1918. Another agreement which was supplementary to that agreement was dated January 15, 1918, and still another dated February 11, 1918\n\n\n In none of these agreements, continuing as they did the obligations of the parties to them and the means of their performance, is there a word of complaint that the government had been or was delinquent on account of not furnishing specifications or in any way. In the agreement of February 11, 1918, in article II it is provided that:\n'In the interest of both parties hereto and in order to expedite the delivery of the said supplies, the government will advance to the contractor under the principal agreement the sum of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) on the terms and security hereinafter mentioned, and will make payments directly to the contractor by check dated February 25, 1918.' \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n There was another agreement dated February 14, 1918, which continued in effect, except as modified, all that preceded. There was no protest or complaint of any kind, no accusation of default or delay on the part of the government.\n\n There was a seventh agreement made September 26, 1918, and another made October 23, 1918, for advance payments to the contractor.\n The agreements are of significant strength. Their legal effect and that of the contract cannot be determined by any one provision, but the totality of them must be regarded and their relations and purposes.\n A war of magnitude was waging. The government was eager for efficient instrumentalities and the contractor was enticed by the profit of their manufacture. The matters were urgent but they were beset with contingencies. The government could terminate the contract in the interest of the public welfare, and the war might cease. The latter did happen. However, before it happened and, before, it may be, there were signs of its happening, there were dealings and adjustments of preparation between the government and the contractor. They took care of, and were intended to take care of, changing purposes, and no dissatisfaction was expressed. One of the changes was, as we have said, from the construction of 500 Liberty motors to 1,000, the completion and delivery of which was to be in June, 1918, and, as we have said, another change was the substitution of 2,000 Bugatti motors for the Liberty engines and for such spare parts as the government might order from time to time; the motors to be delivered by September, 1918. By the supplemental agreements which provided for those changes it was also provided that their cost was to be paid by the government, and the profit of the contractor was changed from $625 for each article to $750, and the government agreed to advance the contractor $ 1,250,000 to be repaid with interest at 5 per cent. \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n Upon this change to the Bugatti motors comes the first claim of the contractor, based upon article 1 of the agreement of January 4, 1918, by which it was provided as follows:\n'That subject to all the provisions of article 1 in said contract No. 2318 contained, the contractor shall make for the government, instead of the articles described in article 1 of said contract, two thousand ( 2,000) Bugatti motors, and such spare parts for said motors as the government may order from time to time during the period of the construction of said motors, in accordance with specifications to follow.' (Italics ours.)\n\n No time is specified. It is, however, contended that necessarily a reasonable time must have been intended and was not observed. The specifications, it is alleged, did not follow until September 25, 1918, when the entire time for the production of the motors was within a few days of expiring, whereby it became impossible to produce any of the articles within the time limit of the contract.\n It is not alleged, however, that the failure to furnish the specifications was willful on the part of the government or fraudulent. On the contrary, it is alleged that there was a belief upon the part of the government officers by whom and under whom the supplemental agreement was made that there were in existence complete specifications of the articles which needed only to be obtained from France; that the motors had passed the experimental stage and were ready for production. It is, however, alleged that the statements in the contract operated as a representation to the contractor that such was the fact, and that production in quantity could begin at or shortly after the entry into the agreement. It is further alleged that when the first motor was received shortly after the date of the agreement it developed that extensive changes would be necessary and the contractor was directed to proceed, meanwhile actively, with production \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n on the separate parts to the extent possible in view of the undeveloped character of the specifications of the engine. This was done in conjunction with the officers of the government.\n It will be observed that it is not alleged that the belief of the government officers was not consistently entertained nor that the contractor did not share it. Nor is it said that the work on the separate parts and the preparations for the performance of the contract did not engage the contractor's time. Indeed, the fact is that by January 4, there were changes to the advantage of the contractor, and again by the agreement of February 11, 1918, and another as late as October 23, 1918, by which the government agreed to advance to the contractor $1,250,000. And still no complaint. On the contrary there was acceptance of assistance.\n It is manifest there were uncertainties on both sides and that as they developed preparations were necessary to meet them, and in meeting them, the contractor did not regard the government in any way delinquent. It was the abrupt and unexpected suspension of hostilities and the declaration of an armistice that was the cause of loss to the contractor, and the disappointment of profits from its contract which it was preparing to realize and would have realized. But it took that chance and has not now a legal claim against the government for reimbursement of its outlays. We need not distinguish between the outlays nor dwell upon them. They were outlays of the speculation, and subject to sacrifice and loss with its disappointment.\n We have seen that counsel make much of the effect of the government's urgency, and, it is contended, time in consequence became an essential of the contract. This, the contention is, influenced the contractor and necessarily determines the obligation of the government. The government was undoubtedly urgent, made so by its serious \n\n[260 U.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n situation and tremendous responsibilities, but such was not the situation of the contractor. Time to perform its contract was all that was necessary to it and but for the Armistice it would have had time. If the Armistice could have been foreseen the relative situations might have been different. Expedition would not then have been exigent to the government's purposes, but would then have been necessary to the contractor, if profits were to be realized from the production of the motors. There was no prophecy of the Armistice-its sudden happening terminated the further execution of the contractor's undertaking, preventing, as we have said, the realization of profits. And, we repeat, this chance the contractor took and must abide the result.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEDGAR A. LEVY LEASING CO. v. SIEGEL(1922)\nNo. 285\nArgued: Decided: March 20, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Wm. D. Guthrie and Julius Henry Cohen, both of New York City, for joint Legislative Committee on Housing of New York Legislature.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were argued and will be disposed of together.\n A motion to dismiss or affirm was filed in each case, on the ground that each is ruled by the decision in Marcus Brown Holding Co., Inc., v. Feldman et al., \n256 U.S. 170\n. 41 Sup. Ct. 465, and both were postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n The essential question presented for decision in the Marcus Brown Co. Case was, and in these cases is, the constitutional validity of the Emergency Housing Laws of the State of New York, approved by the Governor September 27, 1920, chapters 942 to 953, inclusive, Laws of New York 1920\n\n\n By these acts a number of changes were made in the substantive law, and a number of amendments to remedial statutes, of the state, for the purpose of securing to tenants in possession of houses or apartments, occupied for dwelling purposes, in described cities, the legal right to continue in possession until November 1, 1922, by the payment, or securing the payment, of a reasonable rental, to be determined by the courts, and for the purpose also \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n of encouraging the building of dwellings by providing under specified conditions for their exemption from local taxation.\n In No. 285 it is alleged: That a described apartment was leased to the defendant from October 1, 1918, to October 1, 1920, at the stipulated rental of $1,450 per annum, payable in equal monthly installments in advance; that while in possession under that lease in June, 1920, the defendant executed a new lease for two years, beginning on the expiration of the former one on October 1, 1920, at a rental increased to $2,160, payable in equal monthly installments in advance; and that he refuses to pay the installment due on October 1, 1920. Judgment for the one month's rent is prayed for.\n The defendant admits the execution of the leases, as stated in the complaint, but avers that the second one was signed under the coercion and duress of threats of eviction, and that the rent stipulated for is 'unjust, unreasonable and oppressive.' He offers to pay the same amount of rent as was paid for the preceding month and asserts the right to continue in possession under the emergency acts. A motion for judgment on the pleadings presented the question of the constitutionality of chapter 944 of the Emergency Housing Laws and the state courts all held the chapter a constitutional and valid exercise of the police power.\n In No. 287 it is averred: That the defendant is a tenant holding over after expiration of his lease; that he refuses to surrender possession as he stipulated in his lease to do, and that he claims the right to retain possession under chapters 942 and 947 of the Emergency Housing Laws, which suspend the right of action to recover possession except under specified conditions, which are not applicable. A general demurrer to this complaint presented the question of the constitutionality of chapters 942 and 947 of the laws assailed, and the state courts all sustained them as valid. \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n In terms the acts involved are 'emergency' statutes, and, designed as they were by the Legislature to promote the health, morality, comfort and peace of the people of the state, they are obviously a resort to the police power to promote the public welfare. They are a consistent interrelated group of acts essential to accomplish their professed purposes.\n The warrant for this legislative resort to the police power was the conviction on the part of the state legislators that there existed in the larger cities of the state a social emergency, caused by an insufficient supply of dwelling houses and apartments, so grave that it constituted a serious menace to the health, morality, comfort, and even to the peace of a large part of the people of the state. That such an emergency, if it really existed, would sustain a resort, otherwise valid, to the police power for the purpose of dealing with it cannot be doubted, for, unless relieved, the public welfare would suffer in respects which constitute the primary and undisputed, as well as the most usual basis and justification, for exercise of that power.\n In the enactment of these laws the Legislature of New York did not depend on the knowledge which its members had of the existence of the crises relied upon. In January, 1919, almost two years before the laws complained of were enacted, the Governor of the state appointed a 'Reconstruction Commission,' and about the same time the Legislature appointed a committee known as the 'Joint Legislative Committee on Housing,' to investigate and report upon housing conditions in the cities of the state, and a few months later the mayor of New York appointed a similar committee. The membership of these committees comprised many men and women representative of the best intelligence, character, and public service in the state and nation, their investigations were elaborate and thorough, and in their reports, placed before the Legislature, \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n all agree: That there was a very great shortage in dwelling house accommodations in the cities of the state to which the acts apply; that this condition was causing widespread distress; that extortion in most oppressive forms was flagrant in rent profiteering; that, for the purpose of increasing rents, legal process was being abused and eviction was being resorted to as never before; and that unreasonable and extortionate increases of rent had frequently resulted in two or more families being obliged to occupy an apartment adequate only for one family, with a consequent overcrowding, which was resulting in insanitary conditions, disease, immorality, discomfort, and widespread social discontent.\n If this court were disposed, as it is not, to ignore the notorious fact that a grave social problem has arisen from the insufficient supply of dwellings in all large cities of this and other countries, resulting from the cessation of building activities, incident to the war, nevertheless, these reports and the very great respect which courts must give to the legislative declaration that an emergency existed would be amply sufficient to sustain an appropriate resort to the police power for the purpose of dealing with it in the public interest.\n The argument heard in these cases and further examination of the subject confirms us in the assumption made in the Marcus Brown Co. Case, \n256 \nU.S. 170, 198\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 465, that the emergency declared existed when the acts were passed.\n It is strenuously argued, as it was in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, and in the Marcus Brown Co. Case, supra, that the relation of landlord and tenant is a private one, and is not so affected by a public interest as to render it subject to regulation by the exercise of the police power.\n It is not necessary to discuss this contention at length for so early as 1906, the Tenement House Act of New York, enacted in 1901 (Laws 1901, c. 334), was assailed as an unconstitutional interference with the right of property in land, \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n on substantially all of the grounds now urged against the Emergency Housing Laws, this court, in a per curiam opinion affirmed a decree of the Court of Appeals of New York (Tenement House Department of the City of New York v. Katie Moeschen, 179 N. Y. 325, 72 N. E. 231), sustaining regulations requiring large expenditures by landlords as a valid exercise of the police power. Katie Moeschen v. Tenement House Department of the City of New York, \n203 U.S. 583\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 781. To require uncompensated expenditures very certainly affects the right of property in land as definitely, and often as seriously, as regulation of the amount of rent that may be charged for it can do. Many decisions of this court were cited as sufficient to justify the summary disposition there made of the question, as one even then so settled by authority as not to be longer open to discussion.\n In the opinion in Block v. Hirsh, supra, this court cites in support of this same conclusion, under the circumstances there disclosed, which are not to be distinguished from those presented in this case, the later cases following: Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., \n200 U.S. 527\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 301, 4 Ann. Cas. 1174; Welch v. Swasey, \n214 U.S. 91\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 567; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 359; St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, \n249 U.S. 269\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 274; Perley v. North Carolina, \n249 U.S. 510\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 357.\n These authorities show that from time to time for a generation, as occasion arose, this court has held that there is no such inherent difference in property in land, from that in tangible and intangible personal property, as exempts it from the operation of the police power in appropriate cases, and in both the Marcus Brown and Block Cases, supra, it was held, in terms, that the existing circumstances clothed the letting of buildings for dwelling purposes with a public interest sufficient to justify restricting property rights in them to the extent provided for in the laws in those cases objected to.\n In the opinion in the Marcus Brown Co. Case, it is said that the defendant tenants, holding over after their lease \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n had expired relied upon chapters 942 and 947 of the New York Housing Laws, and that the landlord challenged their validity. But this court held them valid. We have seen that in No. 287, here under consideration, the defendant tenant is holding over after the expiration of his lease, and that he justifies under chapters 942 and 947. Thus this No. 287 presents precisely the same questions of fact and law as the Marcus Brown Co. Case presented, and must be ruled by it. \n No. 285\n is a suit against a tenant who, during the term of a lease, which he avers was executed under the coercion and duress of a threat of eviction, refuses to pay the amount of rent stipulated therein, which he alleges is 'unjust, unreasonable and oppressive.' He offers to pay the same rent that he paid for the next preceding month. Such a case falls within the precise terms of chapter 944 of the Emergency Housing Laws, providing that:\n'It shall be a defense to an action for rent accruing under an agreement for premises in a city,' etc., 'occupied for dwelling purposes that such rent is unjust and unreasonable, and that the agreement under which the same is sought to be recovered is oppressive.'\n\n Section 4 of this chapter provides that nothing therein contained shall prevent a plaintiff from pleading and proving in such action a fair and reasonable rent for the premises and recovering judgment therefor.\n It is contended that the validity of this chapter 944 was not directly presented in the Marcus Brown Co. Case, and that the impairment of contracts clause of the Constitution, was not considered or decided in that case as it must be in this one.\n To this there are two answers, either of which is sufficient.\n The first is that the defense sustained in this case, by the court below, was provided for by chapter 136 of the Laws of New York of 1920, in effect when the lease involved was executed. \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n The provision was simply carried into chapter 944 when that chapter was amended in September, 1920, and, of course, a lease made subsequent to the enactment of a statute cannot be impaired by it. Oshkosh Water Works Co. v. Oshkosh, \n187 \nU.S. 437, 446\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 234.\n The second answer is that reference to the report of the Marcus Brown Case shows that this constitutional objection was urged in the briefs, and the court says, in its opinion:\n'The chief objections to these acts have been dealt with in Block v. Hirsh. In the present case more emphasis is laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract of the lessees to surrender possession and of the new lease which was to have gone into effect upon October 1, last year. But contracts are made subject to this exercise of the power of the state when otherwise justified, as we have held this to be. Manigault v. Springs, \n199 U.S. 473\n, 480; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 482; Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 76\n, 77 S.; Union Dry Goods Company v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 U.S. 372\n, 375; Producers Transportation Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, \n251 U.S. 228\n, 232.'\n\n Palpably, as to this constitutional objection to chapter 944 the prior decision is ruling.\n It is also urged that chapter 944 is invalid because the provision that 'it shall be a defense to an action by a landlord that the rent demanded is unjust and unreasonable, and that the agreement under which it is sought to be recovered is oppressive,' is too indefinite a standard to satisfy the due process of law clause of the Constitution.\n The report of the Marcus Brown Case shows that this contention was urged in briefs by the same counsel presenting it here, and it is apparent that the standard was impliedly approved as valid in that case, as it was very \n\n[258 U.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n clearly approved in the Hirsh Case, supra, the court saying:\n'While the act is in force there is little to decide except as to whether the rent allowed is reasonable, and upon that question the courts are given the last word.'\n\n The standard of the statute is as definite as the 'just compensation' standard adopted in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and therefore ought to be sufficiently definite to satisfy the Constitution. United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 U.S. 81\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045, dealing with definitions of crime, is not applicable.\n Several other contentions are pressed upon the attention of the court chiefly with respect to the modifications of the remedial statutes, but such as were not specifically dealt with in the Marcus Brown Co. and Block Cases, impress us as quite unimportant. Given a constitutional substantive statute, enacted to give effect to a constitutional purpose, the states have a wide discretion as to the remedies which may be deemde necessary to achieve such a result, and it is very clear that that discretion has not been exceeded in this instance by the state of New York.\n It results that the judgments of the state court must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nESSANAY FILM MFG. CO. v. KANE(1922)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel Seabury and William M. Seabury, both of New York City, for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellee, William R. Kane, a citizen and resident of New Jersey, having in the year 1917 commenced in the Supreme Court of that state an action at law against appellent, a corporation of Illinois, seeking recovery of $20,000 damages for conversion of certain personal property, and having sought to acquire jurisdiction over defendant in personam by service of the summons and complaint upon the Secretary of State, under a statute that made him the proper official to be served, in the absence of a person designated by the company itself in the year 1910 as its agent upon whom process against the corporation might be served, and appellee having proceeded in the action to the extent of causing an interlocutory judgment to be entered against the company \n\n[258 U.S. 358, 359]\n\u00a0\n in default of its appearance to answer the complaint, and being thereupon entitled under the state practice, in the absence of objection, to take further proceedings and through an assessment of damages to procure a final judgment, appellant brought this suit in equity in the United States District Court for New Jersey, praying an injunction to restrain further prosecution of the action at law by appellee, upon the ground that his alleged cause of action, if any, arose outside the state; that appellant did not then or at any time transact business within the state; that it had designated an office and named a local representative in 1910, and made a proper statement to enable it lawfully to transact business in that state in compliance with the state law, for a temporary purpose which had expired; that while such agency for receipt of process against appellatn continued, it related only to actions arising out of business transacted in the state; that the attempted service of process upon the Secretary of State, as appellant's agent, was void and of no effect and was not due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that appellee's threatened prosecution of his suit to final judgment would result in a taking of appellant's property without due process of law, to its irremediable injury.\n Appellee answered, alleging in substance (among other things) that he had a good cause of action arising out of a conversion of personalty intrusted to appellant in the course of business transacted by it; that appellant had made itself subject to the laws of New Jersey by voluntarily filing a certificate enabling it to transact business in that state, and could not limit the effect of such filing; and that under the laws of that state the service of the summons and complaint upon the Secretary of State was good service and conferred upon the Supreme Court jurisdiction over appellant. \n\n[258 U.S. 358, 360]\n\u00a0\n The cause came on for final hearing upon the bill and answer and a stipulation of the parties that the matters set forth in those pleadings should be taken as the facts in the case; whereupon the District Court held that the proceedings in the state court were within the letter and spirit of the prohibition of section 265, Judicial Code, which re-enacted section 720, Rev. Stat. U. S.:\n'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.' Comp. St.  1242\n\n\n\n See 256 Fed. 271.\n The Circuit Court of appeals affirmed the decision upon the same ground (264 Fed. 959), and an appeal brings the case here.\n In this court, as in the courts below, appellant's chief reliance is upon Simon v. Southern Railway, \n236 U.S. 115\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 255. Without intimating that in other respects the cases are parallel, it is a sufficient ground of distinction that this is an attempt to use the process of the federal court to restrain further prosecution of an action still pending in a state court, while that cited was a case of enjoining a successful litigant from enforcing a final judgment of a state court held void because procured without due process. As was pointed out in that case ( \n236 U.S. 123\n et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 255), the prohibition originated in the Act of Congress of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 334, c. 22,  5, was based upon principles of comity, and designed to avoid inevitable and irritating conflicts of jurisdiction. But when the litigation in the state court has come to an end and final judgment has been obtained, the question whether the successful party should in equity be debarred from enforcing the judgment, either because of his fraud or for the want of due process of law in acquiring jurisdiction, is a different question, which may be passed upon by a federal court with out the conflict which it was the purpose of the act of 1793 to avoid. \n\n[258 U.S. 358, 361]\n\u00a0\n That appellant objection to the action sought to be restrained rests upon a fundamental ground and one based upon a provision of the Constitution of the United States, does not render the effort to stay proceedings in the state court any the less inconsistent with section 265, Judicial Code. That section would be of little force, did it not apply to cases where, save for its prohibition, good ground would exist for enjoining the prosecution of a pending suit. And, as to the Federal question involved, Congress at all times, commencing with the first Judiciary Act (September 24, 1789; 1 Stat. 73, 85, c. 20,  25), has maintained upon the statute book such provisions as it deemed needful for reviewing judicial proceedings in the state courts involving a denial of federal rights, but has confined them to a direct review by this court, and deferred this until final judgment or decree in the state court of last resort. At the same time, since 1793, the prohibition of the use of injunction from a federal court to stay proceedings in a state court has been maintained continuously, and has been consistently upheld. Hull v. Burr, \n234 \nU.S. 712, 723\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 892, and cases cited. In exceptional instances the letter has been departed from while the spirit of the prohibition has been observed; for example, in cases holding that, in order to maintain the jurisdiction of a federal court properly invoked, and render its judgments and decrees effectual, proceedings in a state court which would defeat or impair such jurisdiction may be enjoined. French, Trustee, v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 22 D. Ed. 857; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 U.S. 494\n, 497; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 399; Traction Co. v. Mining Co., \n196 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 251; Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 460. The effect of this, as will be observed, is but to enforce the same freedom from interference on the one hand, that it is the prime object of section 265 to require on the other.\n Besides a challenge of the jurisdiction of the state court for want of due process over defendant in personam, to be \n\n[258 U.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n interposed in that court, and, if overruled, followed by invoking the revisory jurisdiction of this court, the final judgment may be questioned collaterally, if in truth there be a want of due process, either defensively, as in Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 723-733; see, also, York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 21 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 9; Western Indemnity Co. v. Rupp, \n235 \nU.S. 261, 273\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 37; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 U.S. 394\n, 401-403, 37 Sup. Ct. 152; or by adopting the more aggressive method pursued in Simon v. Southern Railway, supra. See, also, Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 U.S. 175\n, 183-185, 41 Sup. Ct. 93. In short, observance by the federal courts, towards litigants in the state courts, of the comity prescribed by section 265, requires orderly procedure but involves no impairment of the substance of contitutional right.\n The case before us presents no exceptional feature, and the courts below correctly disposed of it.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEWERT v. BLUEJACKET(1922)\nNo. 173\nArgued: March 17, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. A. Scott Thompson, of Miami, Okl., for Bluejacket and others.\n Mr. Paul A. Ewert, of Joplin, Mo., in proper.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We have here cross-appeals in a suit to have declared invalid a deed to Paul A. Ewert for restricted lands inherited by the widow and adult and minor heirs of Charles Bluejacket, a full-blood Quapaw Indian, and for an accounting for rents and royalties derived from such lands.\n On October 23, 1908, Ewert was appointed a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States, to \n\n[259 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n 'assist in the institution and prosecution of suits to set aside deeds to certain allotments in the Quapaw Indian Agency,' and by the terms of his appointment his official residence was fixed at Miami, Okl. He testifies that he took the oath of office on the 10th of November, 1908, and about December 1st opened an office at Miami. In his answer he alleges that he made his first bid for the land involved on December 21, 1908, within a month after his arrival at his post; that a second bid was made by him on January 25, 1909; and a third on February 22, 1909, all of which were rejected, because less than the appraisement. On March 29, 1909, he made a bid of $5,000 for the land, which was accepted. The deed he received was dated April 8, 1909, and was approved by the Secretary of the Interior on July 26th following.\n Charles Bluejacket, the ancestor of the vendors, was a full-blood Quapaw Indian, and as such received a patent for the lands involved, dated September 26, 1896, which provided-pursuant to 28 Stat. 907-that the land should be 'inalienable for a period of 25 years' from and after the date of said patent. Thus the restraint on alienation did not expire until September 26, 1921, and it ran with the land, binding the heirs precisely as it bound the ancestor. United States v. Noble, \n237 \nU.S. 74, 80\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 532.\n Congress provided, in 1902 (32 Stat. 245, 275 [Comp. St.  4223]), that adult heirs of a deceased Indian might sell and convey full title to inherited lands free from restrictions, but only by conveyances approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and that the interests of minor heirs might also be so sold and conveyed upon petition of a guardian, on order of a proper court, and when the sale was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Under this statute the lands in controversy were sold in the public manner required by the rules of the Department of the Interior, and for the \n\n[259 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n purposes of this decision all required action is assumed to have been, in form, properly taken.\n The ground upon which the validity of the conveyance to Ewert is assailed is that R. S.  2078 (Comp. St.  4026), rendered it unlawful for him to become a purchaser of Indian lands while holding the position which he did as a special assistant to the Attorney General 'to assist in the institution and prosecution of suits to set aside deeds to certain allotments in the Quapaw Indian Agency,' and that therefore the deed to him was void.\n R. S.  2078, reads:\n'No person employed in Indian affairs shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians, except for, and on account of, the United States; and any person offending herein, shall be liable to a penalty of $5,000 and shall be removed from his office.'\n\n The District Court held that Ewert was not so employed in Indian affairs as to come within the scope and condemnation of the statute and dismissed the bill. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that he came within the statute, and reversed the decree of the District Court as to the minor heirs, but affirmed it as to the adult heirs, on the ground that they were guilty of such laches in delaying bringing suit from the date of the deed in 1909 to 1916 that their cause of action was barred. The case is here for construction of this act of Congress.\n It is argued that, when the land was purchased by Ewert, he was not 'employed in Indian Affairs' within the meaning of R. S.  2078, which, it is contended, includes only 'officers of Indian affairs,' provided for in R. S. title 28, and its amendments.\n The section is derived from the Act of June 30, 1834, c. 162,  14 (4 Stat. 738 [Comp. St.  4026]), which declared that 'no person employed in the Indian department shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians,' etc. The substitution of 'employed in Indian affairs,' used in the \n\n[259 U.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n section of the Revised Statutes, for 'employed in the Indian department,' used in the prior act, was plainly intended to enlarge the scope of the provision, so that it should include all persons employed in Indian affairs, even though they might not be on the roll of the Indian department, which is really only a bureau of the Interior Department.\n The purpose of the section clearly is to protect the inexperienced, dependent, and improvident Indians from the avarice and cunning of unscrupulous men in official position, and at the same time to prevent officials from being tempted, as they otherwise might be, to speculate on that inexperience, or upon the necessities and weaknesses of these 'wards of the nation.' United States v. Hutto et al. (No. 1) \n256 \nU.S. 524, 528\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 541\n\n\n Since the Act of June 22, 1870 (16 Stat. 164, c. 150, carried into R. S.  189 [Comp. St.  271]), no head of any department of the government has been permitted to employ legal counsel at the expense of the United States; but, whenever such counsel is desired, a call must be made upon the Department of Justice, by which it is furnished. In this case, as we have seen, Ewert was specially employed and detailed by the Attorney General, not only to devote himself to Indian affairs, but specifically to institute and prosecute suits relating to lands of the Quapaw Indians, with which we are here concerned, and he himself testifies that during his employment he devoted all of his time to such official duties. He was thus employed to give, and he testifies that at the time of this purchase he was giving, all of his time to the affairs, not of the Indians in general, but to matters relating specifically to the titles of the lands of the Quapaw allottees. If he had been employed by the Secretary of the Interior or by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to perform the same service, no refinement could have suggested the inapplicability to him of the statute, and the fact that under the form of departmental organization \n\n[259 U.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n of the government provided for by statute he was under the general direction of the Department of Justice at the time can make no difference.\n We fully agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that Ewert was employed in Indian affairs, within the meaning and intendment of the act, when he purchased the land.\n It is next contended that the 'trade with the Indians' in which persons employed in Indian affairs were prohibited by the section from engaging must be confined to trade with them when conducted as a business or occupation-to merchants or dealers supplying the Indians with the necessities or conveniences of life. Having regard to the purpose of the statute, as we have stated it, we think that no such narrow interpretation can be given to the section. Congress cannot have intended to prohibit the use of official position and influence for the purpose of overreaching the Indians in the selling to them of clothing or groceries and to permit their use in stripping them of their homes and lands. In United States v. Douglas, 190 Fed. 482, 111 C. C. A. 314, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit declined to allow precisely such a construction as it is contended should be here given to the section, and ruled that the purchase of cattle by an industrial teacher of Indians came within its terms. This decision was rendered over 10 years ago, and, if it had been deemed an erroneous construction of the act, Congress would no doubt have long since modified it. Again we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the land was acquired by Ewert in trade with the Indians, within the meaning of the section.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, upon the construction of the statute with which we thus agree, held the sale to Ewert invalid as to the minor Indian heirs; but, while properly regarding the limitation statutes of Oklahoma as inapplicable, held the adult heirs were barred by laches in failing for seven years to institute suit after delivery of the deed to the land. In this the court fell into error. \n\n[259 U.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n 'The general rule is that an act done in violation of a statutory prohibition is void and confers no right upon the wrongdoer.' Waskey v. Hammer, \n223 \nU.S. 85, 94\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 187, and cases cited. The qualification of this rule suggested in the decisions are as inapplicable to this case as they were to the Waskey Case. The mischief sought to be prevented by the statute is grave, and it not only prohibits such purchases, but it renders the persons making them liable to the penalty of the large fine of $5,000 and removal from office. Any error by the department in the interpretation of the statute cannot confer legal rights inconsistent with its express terms. Prosser v. Finn, \n208 U.S. 67\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 225.\n The purchase by Ewert, being prohibited by the statute, was void. Waskey v. Hammer, supra. He still holds the legal title to the land, and the equitable doctrine of laches, developed and designed to protect goodfaith transactions against those who have slept upon their rights, with knowledge and ample opportunity to assert them, cannot properly have application to give vitality to a void deed and to bar the rights of Indian wards in lands subject to statutory restrictions. Galliher v. Cadwell, \n145 \nU.S. 368, 372\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 873; Halstead v. Grinnan, \n152 \nU.S. 412, 417\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 641; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482, 500\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 554.\n It is alleged in the petition, and not denied, that Ewert incumbered the lands involved with a mortgage, and against it indemnification is prayed for, which should be granted if the lien still subsists.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be affirmed as to the minor heirs, and that as to the adult heirs it must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, for an accounting and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Affirmed in part.\n Reversed in part and remanded. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEXPORTERS OF MFRS' PRODUCTS v.

Judgment resulted from the verdict of a jury and thereupon plaintiff in error took a writ.\n\n'The stated terms of the trial court as prescribed by act of Congress begin each month on the first Tuesday thereof; but a general rule of that court provides as follows: 'For the purpose of taking any action which must be taken within the term of the court at which final judgment or decree is entered, each term of court is extended for ninety days from the date of entry of the final judgment or decree.'\n\n'In respect of this case the ninety-day period above provided for, and therefore the term at which the final judgment in question was entered expired on the 24th of February, 1920\n\n\n\n'On March 1, 1920, a written stipulation was executed between the attorneys for the parties hereto in the words following: 'It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the November term of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York be extended to April 6, 1920, for the purpose of settling and filing the bill of exceptions herein.'\n\n'On or before the 6th of April, 1920, but long after the 24th of February, 1920, the plaintiff in error proposed a bill of exceptions. Thereupon the trial judge, over the objection of defendant in error and on the faith of the \n\n[258 U.S. 365, 368]\n\u00a0\n stipulation above quoted, settled and signed the bill of exceptions annexed to the writ of error herein and now in this court.\n\n'Defendant in error then moved in this court for an order striking from the record the bill of exceptions so settled as above set forth, on the ground that the same had been settled, signed and made a part of the record herein in contravention of law, in that the term had expired.\n\n'Upon consideration of this motion a question of law arises concerning which this court desires the instruction of the Supreme Court in order properly to decide the cause.\n\n'Question Certified. Is the bill of exceptions so as above set forth settled, signed and certified to this court in contravention of law, in that the term had expired before the same was offered for settlement?'\n\n In the recent case of O'Connell v. United States, \n253 \nU.S. 142, 146\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 444, we reaffirmed the doctrine announced in Michigan Insurance Bank v. Eldred, \n143 \nU.S. 293, 298\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 450, 452 (36 L. Ed. 162)--\n'By the uniform course of decision, no exceptions to rulings at a trial can be considered by this court, unless they were taken at the trial, and were also embodied in a formal bill of exceptions presented to the judge at the same term, or within a further time allowed by order entered at that term, or by standing rule of court, or by consent of parties, and, save under very extraordinary circumstances, they must be allowed by the judge and filed with the clerk during the same term. After the term has expired, without the court's control over the case being reserved by standing rule or special order, and especially after a writ of error has been entered in this court, all authority of the court below to allow a bill of exceptions then first presented, or to alter or amend a bill of exceptions already allowed and filed, is at an end.' \n\n[258 U.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n And, applying this rule, we held the bill of exceptions, signed by the trial judge after expiration of the time allowed by the rule of court, was no part of the record.\n\n In the present cause the terms as extended had expired before any action concerning the bill of exceptions was taken by either court or counsel. In such circumstances the court had no power to approve it, unless this could be conferred by mere consent of counsel. This they could not do.\n Consent of parties cannot give jurisdiction to courts of the United States. Railway Co. v. Ramsey, 22 Wall. 322, 327. The policy of the law requires that litigation be terminated within a reasonable time and not protracted at the mere option of the parties. See United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 70\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 16. We think the better rule and the one supported by former opinions of this court requires that bills of exceptions shall be signed before the trial court loses jurisdiction of the cause by expiration of the term or such time thereafter as may have been duly prescribed. The certified question is accordingly answered in the affirmative. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRCHILD v. HUGHES(1922)\nNo. 148\nArgued: January 23, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. L. Marbury and Thomas F. Cadwalader, both of Baltimore, Everett P. Wheeler, of New York City, Alfred D. Smith, of Washington, D. C ., and Waldo G. Morse, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[258 U.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 7, 1920, Charles S. Fairchild, of New York, brought this suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. The prayers of the bill are that 'the so- called Suffrage Amendment [the Nineteenth to the federal Constitution] be declared unconstitutional and void'; that the Secretary of State be restrained from issuing any proclamation declaring that it has been ratified; and that the Attorney General be restrained from enforcing it. There is also a prayer for general relief and for an interlocutory injunction. The plaintiff, and others on whose behalf he sues, are citizens of the United States, taxpayers and members of the American Constitutional League, a voluntary association which describes itself as engaged in diffusing 'knowledge as to the fundamental principles of the American Constitution, and especially that which gives to each state the right to determine for itself the question as to who should exercise the elective franchise therein.'\n The claim to relief was rested upon the following allegations: The Legislatures of 34 of the states have passed resolutions purporting to ratify the Suffrage Amendment; and from one other state the Secretary of State of the United States has received a certificate to that effect purporting to come from the proper officer. The proposed amendment cannot, for reasons stated, be made a part of the Constitution through ratification by the Legislatures, and there are also specific reasons why the resolutions already adopted in several of the states are inoperative. But the Secretary has declared that he is \n\n[258 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n without power to examine into the validity of alleged acts of ratification, and that, upon receiving from one additional state the customary certificate, he will issue a proclamation declaring that the Suffrage Amendment has been adopted. Furthermore, 'a force bill' has been introduced in the Senate, which provides fine and imprisonment for any person who refuses to allow women to vote, and, if the bill is enacted, the Attorney General will be required to enforce its provisions. The threatened proclamation of the adoption of the amendment would not be conclusive of its validity, but it would lead election officers to permit women to vote in states whose Constitutions limit suffrage to men. This would prevent ascertainment of the wishes of the legally qualified voters, and elections, state and federal, would be void. Free citizens would be deprived of their right to have such elections duly held, the effectiveness of their votes would be diminished, and election expenses would be nearly doubled. Thus irremediable mischief would result.\n The Supreme Court of the District granted a rule to show cause why an interlocutory injunction should not issue. The return was promptly made, and the defendants also moved to dismiss the bill. On July 14, 1920, the rule was discharged, a decree was entered dismissing the bill, and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals of the District. The Secretary, having soon thereafter received a certificate of ratification from the thirty-sixth state, proclaimed, on August 26, 1920, the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment. The defendants then moved to dismiss or affirm. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, on the authority of United States v. Colby, 49 App. D. C. 358, 265 Fed. 998, where it had refused to compel the Secretary to cancel the proclamation declaring that the Eighteenth Amendment had been adopted. The grounds of that decision were that the validity of the amendment could be in no way affected by an order \n\n[258 U.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n of cancellation; that it depended on the ratifications by the states, and not on the proclamation; and that the proclamation was unimpeachable, since the Secretary was required, under Revised Statutes,  205 (Comp. St .  303), to issue the proclamation upon receiving from three-fourths of the states official notice of ratification, and had no power to determine whether or not the notices received stated the truth. But we have no occasion to consider these grounds of decision.\n Plaintiff's alleged interest in the question submitted is not such as to afford a basis for this proceeding. It is frankly a proceeding to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared void. In form it is a bill in equity; but it is not a case, within the meaning of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, which confers judicial power on the federal courts, for no claim of plaintiff is 'brought before the court[s] for determination by such regular proceedings as are established by law or custom for the protection or enforcement of rights, or the prevention, redress, or punishment of wrongs.'

The alleged wrongful act of the Secretary of State, said to be threatening, is the issuing of a proclamation which plaintiff asserts will be vain, but will mislead election officers. The alleged wrongful act of the Attorney General, said to be threatening, is the enforcement, as against election officers, of the penalties to be imposed by a contemplated act of Congress which plaintiff asserts would be unconstitutional. But plaintiff is not an election officer; and the state of New York, of which he is a citizen, had previously amended its own Constitution so as to grant the suffrage to women, and had ratified this amendment. Plaintiff has only the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the government be administered according to law and that the public moneys be not wasted. Obviously this general right does not entitle a private citizen to institute in the \n\n[258 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n federal courts a suit to secure by indirection a determination whether a statute, if passed, or a constitutional amendment, about to be adopted, will be valid.

C., for defendants in error. \n\n[259 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for threefold damages brought by the plaintiff in error under the Anti-Trust Acts of July 2, 1890, c. 647,  7, 26 Stat. 209, 210 (Comp. St.  8829), and of October 15, 1914, c. 323,  4, 38 Stat. 730, 731 (Comp. St.  8835d). The defendants are the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, unincorporated associations, composed respectively of groups of eight incorporated base ball clubs, joined as defendants; the presidents of the two Leagues and a third person, constituting what is known as the National Commission, having considerable powers in carrying out an agreement between the two Leagues; and three other persons having powers in the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, the relation of which to this case will be explained. It is alleged that these defendants conspired to monopolize the base ball business, the means adopted being set forth with a detail which, in the view that we take, it is unnecessary to repeat.\n The plaintiff is a base ball club incorporated in Maryland, and with seven other corporations was a member of the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Players, a corporation under the laws of Indiana, that attempted to compete with the combined defendants. It alleges that the defendants destroyed the Federal League by buying up some of the constituent clubs and in one way or another inducing all those clubs except the plaintiff to leave their League, and that the three persons connected with the Federal League and named as defendants, one of them being the President of the League, took part in the conspiracy. Great damage to the plaintiff is alleged. The \n\n[259 U.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff obtained a verdict for $80,000 in the Supreme Court and a judgment for treble the amount was entered, but the Court of Appeals, after an elaborate discussion, held that the defendants were not within the Sherman Act. The appellee, the plaintiff, elected to stand on the record in order to bring the case to this Court at once, and thereupon judgment was ordered for the defendants. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs v. Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, 269 Fed. 681, 688, 50 App. D. C. 165. It is not argued that the plaintiff waived any rights by its course. Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322.\n The decision of the Court of Appeals went to the root of the case and if correct makes it unnecessary to consider other serious difficulties in the way of the plaintiff's recovery. A summary statement of the nature of the business involved will be enough to present the point. The clubs composing the Leagues are in different cities and for the most part in different States. The end of the elaborate organizations and sub- organizations that are described in the pleadings and evidence is that these clubs shall play against one another in public exhibitions for money, one or the other club crossing a state line in order to make the meeting possible. When as the result of these contests one club has won the pennant of its League and another club has won the pennant of the other League, there is a final competition for the world's championship between these two. Of course the scheme requires coustantly repeated travelling on the part of the clubs, which is provided for, controlled and disciplined by the organizations, and this it is said means commerce among the States. But we are of opinion that the Court of Appeals was right.\n The business is giving exhibitions of base ball, which are purely state affairs. It is true that in order to attain for these exhibitions the great popularity that they have achieved, competitions must be arranged between clubs from different cities and States. But the fact that in order \n\n[259 U.S. 200, 209]\n\u00a0\n to give the exhibitions the Leagues must induce free persons to cross state lines and must arrange and pay for their doing so is not enough to change the character of the business. According to the distinction insisted upon in Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 655\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 207, the transport is a mere incident, not the essential thing. That to which it is incident, the exhibition, although made for money would not be called trade of commerce in the commonly accepted use of those words. As it is put by defendant, personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of commerce. That which in its consummation is not commerce does not become commerce among the States because the transportation that we have mentioned takes place. To repeat the illustrations given by the Court below, a firm of lawyers sending out a member to argue a case, or the Chautauqua lecture bureau sending out lecturers, does not engage in such commerce because the lawyer or lecturer goes to another State.\n If we are right the plaintiff's business is to be described in the same way and the restrictions by contract that prevented the plaintiff from getting players to break their bargains and the other conduct charged against the defendants were not an interference with commerce among the States.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. BEECH-NUT PACKING CO.(1922)\nNo. 47\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles W. Dunn, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon a writ of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which court set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring the Beech-Nut Packing Company, a corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of food and other products throughout the United States, to \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n cease and desist from carrying out a plan of resale of its products. \n1\n Beech-Nut Packing Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 264 Fed. 885.\n The Commission condemned the plan as an unfair method of competition within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 38 Stat. 719 (Comp. St.  8836e).\n In the original complaint it was charged that in order to accomplish the illegal purpose intended the Beech-Nut Company required its purchasers to agree to maintain or resell such products at standard selling prices, and that for the purpose of maintaining such standard resale prices and for the purpose of inducing and compelling its customers to maintain and keep such standard prices the company refused to sell its products to customers and dealers who would not agree to maintain such specified standard resale prices, and who did not resell such products at the specified standard selling prices fixed and determined by the company. By stipulation before trial the complaint was amended so as to charge: That the Beech-Nut Company, has adopted and enforced a system of fixing and maintaining certain specified standard prices at which its chewing gum and food products shall be \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n resold by purchasers thereof, including jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, with the purpose and effect of securing the trade of such jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers and of enlisting their active support and cooperation in enlarging the sale of respondent's products, to the prejudice of its competitors who do not require and enforce the maintenance of resale prices for their products; and with the purpose and effect of eliminating competition in prices among all jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, respectively, engaged in handling the products manufactured by the company, thereby depriving such distributors of their right to sell, and preventing them from selling its products at such prices as they may deem to be, and as are, adequate and warranted by their respective selling costs and efficiency, and with various other effects, and that the company as a means of making effective its system of resale prices and of inducing and compelling its customers and the dealer customers of its customers to maintain such resale prices, has for more than two years last past: Made it generally known to jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, respectively, that it required and insisted that they should sell its products at the resale prices so fixed by it, and refused to sell to jobbers, wholesalers, or retailers not maintaining such prices; that the company threatened to and did refuse to sell to all jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who failed to maintain the resale prices so fixed by it, or who sold to other distributors who failed to maintain such prices; induced or compelled the jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, by divers other means, not only to maintain its resale prices so fixed, but also to discontinue selling its products to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who did not maintain such resale prices; that the company caused the diversion of retailer's orders away from jobbers and wholesalers who did not maintain such resale prices so fixed by it, or who \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n had resold its products to other jobbers, wholesalers, or retailers who had failed to maintain such resale prices, and caused such orders to be given to other jobbers and wholesalers who had maintained such resale prices and\/or had refused to suppy other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers failing to maintain such prices; that the company solicited and secured the co-operation of wholesalers, jobbers, and retailers in reporting price cutters, all in pursuance of its efforts to ascertain the names of all distributors of its products who had failed to maintain the resale prices fixed by it, and\/or who had resold to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers failing to maintain such prices; that it entered in card records kept by it the names of all dealers reported to it, either in this or other ways, as not maintaining its resale prices or as selling to other distributors not maintaining such prices, and has taken various measures to prevent all such dealers from obtaining further shipments of its products from any source until it has received from them declarations, promises, assurances, statements, or other similar expressions, to the effect that in the future such dealers intend to and will sell such products at the resale prices fixed by the company and will refrain from selling the same to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers failing to maintain such prices; that respondent employed various other means and methods for the enforcement of its system of maintaining resale prices.\n The case was heard before the Commission upon an agreed statement of facts, from which, among other things, it found:\n The Beech-Nut Packing Company customarily markets its products principally through jobbers and wholesalers in the grocery, drug, candy and tobacco lines, who in turn resell to retailers in these lines. Such wholesale and retail dealers are selected as desirable customers because they are known or believed to be of good credit standing; \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n who are willing to resell at the resale prices suggested by the company and who do resell at such prices; are willing to refuse to sell and who do refuse to sell to jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who do not resell at the resale prices suggested by the company, and who do not sell to such jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, who in other respects are good and satisfactory merchandisers. Such jobbers, wholesalers and retailers are designated by the company as 'selected' or 'desirable' dealers. In a few instances the company also sells 'direct' to certain large retailers who are selected as the jobbers, wholesalers and retailers. The total number of such dealers, handling the products of the company, includes the greater portion of the jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, respectively, in the grocery trades, and a large proportion of the jobbers, wholesalers and retailers in the drug, candy, and tobacco trades respectively, throughout the United States.\n The company has adopted and maintained, and still maintained at the time complaint was filed by the Commission, in the sale and distribution of its products a policy known as the 'Beech-Nut policy,' and requests the co-operation therein of all dealers selling the products manufactured by it, dealing with each customer separately.\n In order to secure such co-operation and to carry out the Beech-Nut policy the company:\n Issues circulars, price lists, and letters to the trade generally showing suggested uniform resale prices, both wholesale and retail, to be charged for Beech-Nut products.\n Requests and insists that the selected jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers sell only to such other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers as have been and are willing to resell and do resell at the prices so suggested by the company, and requests and insists that such jobbers, wholesalers \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n and retailers discontinue selling to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who fail to resell at the prices so suggested by the company.\n Makes it known broadcast to such selected jobbers, wholesalers and retailers, whether sold 'direct' or not, that if they, or any of them fail to sell at the resale prices suggested by the company, it will absolutely refuse to sell further supplies of its product to them, or any of them, and will also absolutely refuse to sell to any jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers whatsoever who sell to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers failing to resell at the prices suggested by the company.\n The company, in the carrying out of its policy has refused and does refuse to sell its products to practically all such jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers as do not sell at the prices so suggested by it. It has refused and does refuse to sell to practically all such jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers reselling to other jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who have failed to resell at the prices so suggested by it. It has refused and does refuse to sell to practically all so-called mail- order houses engaged in interstate commerce, on the ground that such mail- order houses frequently sell at cut prices, and has refused and does refuse to sell to practically all jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who sell its products to such mail-order houses. It has maintained and does refuse to sell to practically all so-called price cutters. It has maintained and does maintain a large force of so-called specialty salesmen or representatives who call upon the retail trade and solicit orders therefrom to be filled through jobbers and wholesalers, which orders are commonly known in the trade as 'turnover orders'; its salesmen, under respondent's instructions, have refused and do refuse to accept any such turnover orders to be filled through jobbers and wholesalers who themselves sell or have sold at less than the suggested resale prices, or sell or have sold to jobbers, \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n wholesalers and retailers who sell or have sold at less than such suggested resale prices, and in such cases has requested such retailers to name other jobbers.\n The company has reinstated and does reinstate as distributors of its products jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers previously cut off or withdrawn from the list of selected jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers for failure to resell at the prices suggested by it, and for selling to distributors who do not maintain such suggested resale prices, upon the basis of declarations, assurances, statements, promises, and similar expressions, as the case may be by such distributors, respectively, who satisfy the company that such distributors will thereafter resell at the prices suggested by it and will refuse to sell to distributors who do not maintain such suggested resale prices.\n The company has added and does add, to its list of new distributors, concerns reported by its representatives as declaring that they intend to and will resell at the prices suggested by it, and will refuse to sell to those who do not maintain such suggested resale prices. It has utilized a system of key numbers or symbols stamped or marked upon the cases containing the 'Beech-Nut brand' products, thus enabling it, for any purpose whatsoever, to ascertain the identity of the distributors from whom such products were purchased; and that repeatedly, when instances of price-cutting have been reported to it by the selected wholesalers and retailers, or ascertained in other ways, its salesmen and representatives have been instructed by it to investigate, and that in pursuance of these instructions they have by means of these key numbers or symbols traced the price-cutters from whom the goods have been obtained, and have thus ascertained the identity of such price-cutters, and have also thus traced and ascertained the identity of distributors from whom price cutters have purchased 'Beech-Nut brand' products; and has thereafter refused to \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n supply all such dealers with its products, whether such dealers were themselves cutting the suggested resale prices or were selling to dealers cutting the suggested resale prices.\n The company has maintained and does maintain card records containing the names of thousands of jobbing, wholesale, and retail distributors, including the selected distributors, and in furtherance of its refusal to sell goods either to distributors selling at less than the suggested resale prices, or to distributors selling to other distributors selling at less than the suggested resale prices, has listed upon those cards, bearing the names of such distributors, the words 'Undesirable-Price Cutters,' 'Do Not Sell,' or 'D. N. S.,' the abbreviation for 'Do Not Sell,' or expresssions of a like character, to indicate that the particular distributor was in the future not to be supplied with respondent's goods on account of failure to maintain the suggested resale prices, or on account of failure to discontinue selling to dealers failing to maintain such suggested resale prices. When the company has received declarations, assurances, statements, promises, or similar expressions, as the case may be, by distributors which satisfy it that such distributors will resell at the prices suggested by it, and discontinue selling to distributors failing to maintain the resale prices suggested by it, it has issued instructions to 'clear the record,' or directions of similar import, notation of which is made on the cards, and it has thereafter permitted shipments of its products to be made to such distributors; and such distributors to whom shipments are thus allowed to go forward constitute the company's list of so-called 'selected' jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers, and no distributor is thus listed on such card record as one to whom goods are allowed to go forward who fails to maintain the resale prices suggested by it or sells to distributors failing to resell at such suggested price; and when a jobber, \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 451]\n\u00a0\n wholesaler, or retailer is reported as failing to maintain the suggested resale prices, and has been entered in the card records as one to whom shipments should not go forward, respondent notifies those jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers who supply the distributor, of this fact, and also notifies its specialty salesmen, and gives similar notices to such jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers and to its specialty salesmen when reinstatements are made in its list of 'selected' jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion that the only difference between the price-fixing policy condemned as unlawful in Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 376, and the price-fixing plan embodied in the BeechNut policy was that in the former case there was an agreement in writing, while in this case the success or failure of the plan depended upon a tacit understanding with purchasers and prospective purchasers. While it expressed its difficulty in seeing any difference between a written agreement and a tacit understanding in their effect upon the restraint of trade, it, nevertheless, regarded the case as governed by the decision of this court in United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443, and, accordingly, held that the Commission had exceeded its power in making the order appealed from.\n The Colgate Case was prosecuted under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act ( Comp. St.  8820 et seq.), and came to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act (Comp. St.  1704). We therein held that this Court must accept the construction of the indictment as made in the District Court; and, that upon such construction, the only act charged amounted to the exercise of the right of the trader, or manufacturer, engaged in private business, to exercise his own discretion as to those with whom he would deal, and to announce the circumstances under which he would refuse to sell, and that thus interpreted no act was charged in the indictment which amounted to a violation of the Sherman Act prohibiting monopolies, \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 452]\n\u00a0\n contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of interstate commerce.\n In the subsequent case of United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 U.S. 85\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 251, this Court had occasion to deal with a case under the Criminal Appeals Act, wherein there was a charge that a manufacturer sold to manufacturers in several states under an agreement to observe certain resale prices fixed by the vendor-which we held to be a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. In referring to the Colgate Case we said:\n'The court below misapprehended the meaning and effect of the opinion and judgment in that cause. We had no intention to overrule or modify the doctrine of Dr. Miles Medical Company v. Park & Sons Co., where the effort was to destroy the dealers' independent discretion through restrictive agreements. Under the interpretation adopted by the trial court and necessarily accepted by us, the indictment failed to charge that Colgate & Co. made agreements, either express or implied, which undertook to obligate vendees to observe specified resale prices; and it was treated as alleging only recognition of the manufacturer's undoubted right to specify resale prices and refuse to deal with anyone who failed to maintain the same.'\n\n In the still later case of Frey & Son v. Cudahy Packing Co., \n256 U.S. 208\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 451, wherein this court again had occasion to consider the subject, it was said of the previous decisions in United States v. Colgate and United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., supra:\n'Apparently the former case was misapprehended. The latter opinion distinctly stated that the essential agreement, combination or conspiracy might be implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances.'\n\n By these decisions it is settled that in prosecutions under the Sherman Act a trader is not guilty of violating its terms who simply refuses to sell to others, and he may withhold his goods from those who will not sell them at the \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 453]\n\u00a0\n prices which he fixes for their resale. He may not, consistently with the act, go beyond the exercise of this right, and by contracts or combinations, express or implied, unduly hinder or obstruct the free and natural flow of commerce in the channels of interstate trade.\n The Sherman Act is not involved here except in so far as it shows a declaration of public policy to be considered in determining what are unfair methods of competition, which the Federal Trade Commission is empowered to condemn and suppress. The case now before us was begun under the Federal Trade Commission Act which was intended to supplement previous anti-trust legislation. See Report, No. 597, of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, June 13, 1914, 63d Congress, 2d Session. That act declares unlawful 'unfair methods of competition' and gives the Commission authority after hearing to make orders to compel the discontinuance of such methods. What shall constitute unfair methods of competition denounced by the act, is left without specific definition. Congress deemed it better to leave the subject without precise definition, and to have each case determined upon its own facts, owing to the multifarious means by which it is sought to effectuate such schemes. The Commission, in the first instance, subject to the judicial review provided, has the determination of practices which come within the scope of the act. See Report, No. 597, Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, June 13, 1914, 63d Congress, 2d Session.\n Of the Federal Trade Commission Act we said, in Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 572, 575 (64 L. Ed. 993):\n'The words 'unfair method of competition' are not defined by the statute and their exact meaning is in dispute. It is for the courts, not the Commission, ultimately to determine as matter of law what they include. They are clearly inapplicable to practices never heretofore regarded as opposed to good morals because characterized by deception, \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 454]\n\u00a0\n bad faith, fraud or oppression, or as against puble policy because of their dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or create monopoly. The act was certainly not intended to fetter free and fair competition as commonly understood and practiced by honorable opponents in trade.'\n\n If the 'Beech-Nut system of merchandising' is against public policy, because of 'its dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or to create monopoly,' it was within the power of the Commission to make an order forbidding its continuation. We have already seen to what extent the declaration of public policy, contained in the Sherman Act, permits a trader to go. The facts found show that the Beech-Nut system goes far beyond the simple refusal to sell goods to persons who will not sell at stated prices, which in the Colgate Case was held to be within the legal right of the producer.\n The system here disclosed necessarily constitutes a scheme which restrains the natural flow of commerce and the freedom of competition in the channels of interstate trade which it has been the purpose of all the Anti-Trust Acts to maintain. In its practical operation it necessarily constrains the trader, if he would have the products of the Beech-Nut Company, to maintain the prices 'suggested' by it. If he fails so to do, he is subject to be reported to the company either by special agents, numerous and active in that behalf, or by dealers whose aid is enlisted in maintaining the system and the prices fixed by it. Furthermore, he is enrolled upon a list known as 'Undesirable-Price Cutters,' to whom goods are not to be sold, and who are only to be reinstated as one whose record is 'clear' and to whom sales may be made upon his giving satisfactory assurance that he will not resell the goods of the company except at the prices suggested by it, and will refuse to sell to distributors who do not maintain such prices. \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 455]\n\u00a0\n From this course of conduct a court may infer-indeed, cannot escape the conclusion-that competition among retail distributors is practically suppressed for all who would deal in the company's products are constrained to sell at the suggested prices. Jobbers and wholesale dealers who would supply the trade may not get the goods of the company, if they sell to those who do not observe the prices indicated or who are on the company's list of undesirables until they are restored to favor by satisfactory assurances of future compliance with the company's schedules of resale prices. Nor is the inference overcome by the conclusion stated in the Commission's findings that the merchandising conduct of the company does not constitute a contract or contracts whereby resale prices are fixed, maintained, or enforced. The specific facts found show suppression of the freedom of competition by methods in which the company secures the co-operation of its distributors and customers, which are quite as effectual as agreements express or implied intended to accomplish the same purpose. By these methods the company, although selling its products at prices satisfactory to it, is enabled to prevent competition in their subsequent disposition by preventing all who do not sell at resale prices fixed by it from obtaining its goods.\n Under the facts established we have no doubt of the authority and power of the Commission to order a discontinuance of practices in trading, such as are embodied in the system of the Beech-Nut Company.\n We are, however, of opinion that the order of the Commission is too broad. The order should have required the company to cease and desist from carrying into effect its so-called Beech-Nut policy by co-operative methods in which the respondent and its distributors, customers and agents undertake to prevent others from obtaining the company's products at less than the prices designated by \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 456]\n\u00a0\n it-(1) by the practice of reporting the names of dealers who do not observe such resale prices; (2) by causing dealers to be enrolled upon lists or undesirable purchasers who are not to be supplied with the products of the company unless and until they have given satisfactory assurances of their purpose to maintain such designated prices in the future; (3) by employing salesmen or agents to assist in such plan by reporting dealers who do not observe such resale prices, and giving orders of purchase only to such jobbers and wholesalers as sell at the suggested prices and refusing to give such orders to dealers who sell at less than such prices, or who sell to others who sell at less than such prices; (4) by utilizing numbers and symbols marked upon cases containing their products with a view to ascertaining the names of dealers who sell the company's products at less than the suggested prices, or who sell to others who sell at less than such prices in order to prevent such dealers from obtaining the products of the company; or (5) by utilizing any other equivalent co-operative means of accomplishing the maintenance of prices fixed by the company.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to enter judgment in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n There are obvious limits of propriety to the persistent expression of opinions that do not command the agreement of the Court. But as this case presents a somewhat new field-the determination of what is unfair competition within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act-I venture a few words to explain my dissent. I will not recur to fundamental questions. The ground on \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 457]\n\u00a0\n which the respondent is held guilty is that its conduct has a dangerous tendency, unduly to hinder competition or to create monopoly. It is enough to say that this I cannot understand. So far as the Sherman Act is concerned I had supposed that its policy was aimed against attempts to create a monopoly in the doers of the condemned act or to hinder competition with them. Of course there can be nothing of that sort here. The respondent already has the monopoly of its own goods with the full assent of the law and no one can compete with it with regard to those goods, which are the only ones concerned. It seems obvious that the respondent is not creating a monopoly in them for anyone else, although I see nothing to hinder its doing so by conveying them all to one single vendee. The worst that can be said, so far as I see, is that it hinders competition among those who purchase from it. But it seems to me that the very foundation of the policy of the law to keep competition open is that the subject-matter of the competition would be open to all but for the hindrance complained of. I cannot see what that policy has to do with a subject-matter that comes from a single hand that is admitted to be free to shut as closely as it will. And to come back to the words of the statute I cannot see how it is unfair competition to say to those to whom the respondent sells and to the world, you can have my goods only on the terms that I propose, when the existence of any competition in dealing with them depends upon the respondent's will. I see no wrong in so doing, and if I did I should not think it a wrong within the possible scope of the word unfair. Many unfair devices have been exposed in suits under the Sherman Act, but to whom the respondent's conduct is unfair I do not understand.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting.\n With regret, I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court.\n This matter was submitted to the Commission upon an agreed statement of facts, the twelfth clause of which-the last but one-declares:\n'12. That the merchandising conduct of respondent heretofore defined and as herein involved does not constitute a contract or contracts whereby resale prices are fixed, maintained and enforced.'\n\n Of course, the Packing Company entered into this stipulation relying upon the quoted clause, and I am not at liberty either to disregard it or to minimize the plain import of its words. It is not a mere conclusion of the Commission but a definite and essential admission of record upon which the company rested and without which I must conclude a different case might have been presented.\n There is no question of monopoly. Acting alone, respondent certainly had the clear right freely to select its customers-to refuse to deal when and as it saw fit-and to announce that future sales would be limited to those whose conduct met with its approval. United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443; United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 U.S. 85\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 251; Frey & Son v. Cudahy Packing Co. (decided April 18, 1921) \n256 U.S. 208\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 451.\n If the solemn stipulation did not expressly negative the existence of contracts amongst the parties to maintain prices, I should think the detailed facts sufficient to support a finding that there were such agreements. But starting with that plain negation I can find no adequate ground for condemning the respondent.\n The very order which the court below is now directed to enter conflicts with the stipulation between the parties by presupposing 'methods of co-operation between respondent and the distributors of its products, especially the co-operative methods by which the respondent and the \n\n[257 U.S. 441, 459]\n\u00a0\n distributors of its products undertake to prevent others from obtaining such products at less than the prices fixed by respondent, (by) the co- operation of customers in reporting the names of dealers who do not observe such resale prices with the view to prevent their obtaining the products of the Beech-nut Company thereafter.' How can there be methods of co-operation, co-operative methods, an nudertaking to prevent others, or the co-operation of customers with a view to prevent others, when the existence of the essential contracts is definitely excluded?\n Having the undoubted right to sell to whom it will why should respondent be enjoined from writing down the names of dealers regarded as undesirable customers? Nor does there appear to be any wrong in maintaining special salesmen who turn over orders to selected wholesalers and who honestly investigate and report to their principal the treatment accorded its products by dealers. Finally, as respondent may freely select customers, how can injury result from marks on packages which enable it to trace their movements? The privilege to sell or not to sell at will surely involves the right by open and honest means to ascertain what selected customers do with goods voluntarily sold to them.\n Under the circumstances disclosed, constraint upon the freedom of merchants can only result from withholding trade relations or threatening so to do. These, when acting alone, respondent may assume or decline at pleasure, there being neither monopoly nor attempt to monopolize. And the exercise of this right does not become an unfair method of competition merely because some dealers cannot obtain goods which they desire, and others may be deterred from selling at reduced prices. If a manufacturer should limit his customers to consumers he would thereby destroy competition among dealers, but neither they nor the public could complain. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Now, therefore, it is ordered that respondent, the Beech-Nut Packing Company, its officers, directors, agents, servants, and employees cease and desist from directly or indirectly recommending, requiring, or by any means bringing about the resale of Beech-Nut products by distributors, whether at wholesale or retail according to any system of prices fixed or established by respondent, and more particularly by any or all of the following means:\n'1. Refusing to sell to any such distributors because of their failure to adhere to any such system of resale prices.\n\n'2. Refusing to sell to any such distributors because of their having resold respondent's said products to other distributors who have failed to adhere to any such system of resale prices.\n\n'3. Securing or seeking to secure the co-operation of its distributors in maintaining or enforcing any such system of resale prices.\n\n'4.

WINSTED HOSIERY CO.(1922)\nNo. 333\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 483, 484]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Solicitor General James M. Beck and Adrien F. Busick, both of Washington, D.

C., representing Paint Manufacturers Association of the United States and National Varnish Manufacturers Association.\n Mr. Walter Gordon Merritt, of New York City, representing The Silk Association of America, amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Winsted Hosiery Company has for many years manufactured underwear which it sells to retailers throughout the United States. It brands or labels the cartons in which the underwear is sold, as 'Natural Merino,' 'Gray Wool,' 'Natural Wool,' 'Natural Worsted,' or 'Australian Wool.' None of this underwear is all wool. Much of it contains only a small percentage of wool; some as little as 10 per cent. The Federal Trade Commission instituted a complaint under section 5 of the Act of September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 719 (Comp. St.  8836e), and called upon the company to show cause why use of these brands and labels alleged to be false and deceptive should not be discontinued. After appropriate proceedings an order was issued which, as later modified, directed the company to--\n'cease and desist from employing or using as labels or brands on underwear or other knit goods not composed wholly of wool, or on the wrappers, boxes or other containers in which they are delivered to customers, the words 'Merino,' 'Wool,' or 'Worsted,' alone or in combination with any other word or words, unless accompanied by a word or words designating the substance, fiber or material other than wool of which the garments are composed in part (e. g., 'Merino, Wool and Cotton'; 'Wool and Cotton'; 'Worsted, Wool and Cotton'; 'Wool, Cotton, and Silk') or by a word or words otherwise clearly indicating that such underwear or other goods is not made wholly of wool (e. g., part wool).' \n\n[258 U.S. 483, 491]\n\u00a0\n A petition for review of this order was filed by the company in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The prayer that the order be set aside was granted; and a decree to that effect was entered. \n1\n That court said:\n\n'Conscientious manufacturers may prefer not to use a label which is capable of misleading, and it may be that it will be desirable to prevent the use of the particular labels, but it is in our opinion not within the province of the Federal Trade Commission to do so.' 272 Fed. 957, 961.\n\n The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n256 U.S. 688\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 625 65 L. Ed. 1172\n\n\n The order of the Commission rests upon findings of fact; and these upon evidence which fills 350 pages of the printed record. Section 5 of the act makes the Commission's findings conclusive as to the facts, if supported by evidence.\n The findings here involved are clear, specific and comprehensive: The word 'Merino,' as applied to wool, 'means primarily and popularly' a fine long-staple wool, which commands the highest price. The words 'Australian Wool' mean a distinct commodity, a fine grade of wool grown in Australia. The word 'wool' when used as an adjective means made of wool. The word 'worsted' means primarily and popularly a yarn or fabric made wholly of wool. A substantial part of the consuming public, and also some buyers for retailers and sales \n\n[258 U.S. 483, 492]\n\u00a0\n people, understand the words 'Merino,' 'Natural Merino,' 'Gray Merino,' 'Natural Wool,' 'Gray Wool,' 'Australian Wool' and 'Natural Worsted,' as applied to underwear, to mean that the underwear is all wool. By means of the labels and brands of the Winsted Company bearing such words, part of the public is misled into selling or into buying as all wool, underwear which in fact is in large part cotton. And these brands and labels tend to aid and encourage the representations of unscrupulous retailers and their salesmen who knowingly sell to their customers as all wool, underwear which is largely composed of cotton. Knit underwear made wholly of wool, has for many years been widely manufactured and sold in this country and constitutes a substantial part of all knit underwear dealt in. It is sold under various labels or brands, including 'Wool,' 'All Wool,' 'Natural Wool' and 'Pure Wool,' and also under other labels which do not contain any words descriptive of the composition of the article. Knit underwear made of cotton and wool is also used in this country by some manufacturers who market it without any label or marking describing the material or fibers of which it is composed, and by some who market it under labels bearing the words 'Cotton and Wool' or 'Part Wool.' The Winsted Company's product, labeled and branded as above stated, is being sold in competition with such all wool underwear, and such cotton and wool underwear.\n That these findings of fact are supported by evidence cannot be doubted. But it is contended that the method of competition complained of is not unfair within the meaning of the act, because labels such as the Winsted Company employs, and particularly those bearing the word 'Merino,' have long been established in the trade and are generally understood by it as indicating goods partly of cotton; that the trade is not deceived by them; that there was no unfair competition for which another \n\n[258 U.S. 483, 493]\n\u00a0\n manufacturer of underwear could maintain a suit against the Winsted Company; and that even if consumers are misled because they do not understand the trade signification of the label or because some retailers deliberately deceive them as to its meaning, the result is in no way legally connected with unfair competition.\n This argument appears to have prevailed with the Court of Appeals; but it is unsound. The labels in question are literally false, and, except those which bear the word 'Merino,' are palpably so. All are, as the Commission found, calculated to deceive and do in fact deceive a substantial portion of the purchasing public. That deception is due primarily to the words of the labels, and not to deliberate deception by the retailers from whom the consumer purchases. While it is true that a secondary meaning of the word 'Merino' is shown, it is not a meaning so thoroughly established that the description which the label carries has ceased to deceive the public; for even buyers for retailers, and sales people, are found to have been misled. The facts show that it is to the interest of the public that a proceeding to stop the practice be brought. And they show also that the practice constitutes an unfair method of competition as against manufacturers of all wool knit underwear and as against those manufacturers of mixed wool and cotton underwear who brand their product truthfully. For when misbranded goods attract customers by means of the fraud which they perpetrate, trade is diverted from the producer of truthfully marked goods. That these, honest manufacturers might protect their trade by also resorting to deceptive labels is no defense to this proceeding brought against the Winsted Company in the public interest.\n The fact that misrepresentation and misdescription have become so common in the knit underwear trade that most dealers no longer accept labels at their face value does not prevent their use being an unfair method of competition. \n\n[258 U.S. 483, 494]\n\u00a0\n A method inherently unfair does not cease to be so because those competed against have become aware of the wrongful practice. Nor does it cease to be unfair because the falsity of the manufacturer's representation has become so well known to the trade that dealers, as distinguished from consumers, are no longer deceived. The honest manufacturer's business may suffer, not merely through a competitor's deceiving his direct customer, the retailer, but also through the competitor's putting into the hands of the retailer an unlawful instrument, which enables the retailer to increase his own sales of the dishonest goods, thereby lessening the market for the honest product. That a person is a wrongdoer who so furnishes another with the means of consummating a fraud has long been a part of the law of unfair competition. \n2\n And trade-marks which deceive the public are denied protection although members of the trade are not misled thereby. \n3\n As a substantial part of the public was still misled by the use of the labels which the Winsted Company employed, the public had an interest in stopping the practice as wrongful; and since the business of its trade rivals who marked their goods truthfully was necessarily affected by that practice, the Commission was justified in its conclusion that the practice constituted an unfair method of competition; and it was authorized to order that the practice be discontinued.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The original order of the Commission was based on findings which rested upon an agreed statement of facts. The petition for review urged, among other things, that the agreed statement did not support the findings. Thereupon the Commission moved in the Court of Appeals that the case be remanded to the Commission for additional evidence as provided in the fourth paragraph of section 5 of the act. Under leave so granted the evidence was taken: and modified findings of fact were made. The modified order was based on these findings. It is this modified order which was set aside by the Court of Appeals; and we have no occasion to consider the original order or the proceedings which led up to it. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Von Mumm v.

Brant and Charles Haldane, both of New York City, and James G. Wilson, of Portland, Or., for appellant.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Carey and James B. Kerr, both of Portland, Or., for appellees.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a bill filed in the District Court of the United States for the District of Oregon, appellant asserted a dower right in 1\/2 part of certain land in possession of the railway company.\n The bill was dismissed on motion of the railway company and the company was awarded judgment for costs. On appeal by the complainant in the suit, the judgment was affirmed. Against the affirmance this appeal is prosecuted.\n The law of Oregon provides:\n'The widow of every deceased person shall be entitled to dower, or the use, during her natural life, of one-half part of all the lands whereof her husband was seized of an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage, unless she is lawfully barred thereof.' L. O. L.  7286\n\n\n\n'A woman being an alien shall not on that account be barred of her dower; and any woman residing out of the state shall be entitled to dower of the lands of her deceased husband lying in this state of which her husband died seized, and the same may be assigned to her, or recovered by her, in like manner as if she and her deceased husband had been residents within the state at the time of his death.' Section 7306.\n\n Appellant adduces against the validity of section 7306, the provision of section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution of the United States that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states,' and the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment which declare that no state shall 'make or \n\n[258 U.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' or 'deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law' or 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n Dower is not a prvilege or immunity of citizenship, either state or federal, within the meaning of the provisions relied on. At most it is a right which, while it exists, is attached to the marital contract or relation, and it always has been deemed subject to regulation by each state as respects property within its limits. Conner v. Elliot, 18 How. 591. Neither section 2 of article 4 nor the Fourteenth Amendment takes from the several states the power to regulate this subject; nor does either make it a privilege or immunity of citizenship. Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 537\n, 538 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 2, and cases cited; United States v. Wheeler, \n254 \nU.S. 281, 296\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 133.\n The further contention, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, necessarily is, as counsel urged, that dower is 'fundamental and substantial'-'a property right, being, while inchoate, a chose in action, of which no citizen of the United States, wherever he [she] may be resident can be deprived without 'due process of law,' and as to which every person is entitled to the 'equal protection of the laws' as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (268 Fed. 117) considered this contention, and it is difficult to add anything to its opinion. It pointed out that the Oregon statute was taken from the laws of Michigan adopted in 1846 and sustained. \n1\n The example of Michigan was followed in Wisconsin, Kansas, and Nebraska, and sustained by the courts of those states. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[258 U.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n To the decisions of those courts we may add Thornburn v. Doscher (U. S. Circuit Court for Oregon) 32 Fed. 810, which sustained the Oregon statute, as did the Supreme Court of Oregon in Cunningham v. Friendly, 70 Or. 222, 139 Pac. 928, 140 Pac. 989. And we may add also Richards v. Bellingham Bay Land Co., 54 Fed. 209, 4 C. C. A. 290, which decided to be legal a like statute of the state of Washington. And Blackstone speaks of dower as having become 'a great clog to alienation' and 'otherwise inconvenient to families.' 1 Washburn on Real Property (5th Ed.) 278, in note.\n The cases recognize that the limitation of the dower right is to remove an impediment to the transfer of real estate and to assure titles against absent and probably unknown wives. And such is the purpose of the Oregon statute, and the means of executing the purpose appropriate, and a proper exercise of classification. It satisfies, therefore, the constitutional requirement of the equal protection of the laws; and we proceed to the inquiry whether the statute is otherwise valid.\n Appellant's contention is that though she be living in New York, it is her privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to resist the law of Oregon as a limitation of her dower rights, that is, a limitation of rights in property situated in Oregon. The contention might be tenable if the Legislature of a state was required to grant dower rights. As repellant of that proposition, the difference the laws of the states exhibit in the rights that attach to the marriage relation may be adduced. The states greatly differ as to what lands are dowable, and as to what claims are paramount to dower, and to some extent, how it will be barred. 4 Kent, 35 et seq.\n The granting of dower, therefore, is a matter of statutory regulation. It was so decided by the United States Circuit Court of Oregon in 1887 ( Thornburn v. Doscher, supra); Judge Deady expressing it as follows:\n'It rests with the Legislature to say what interest, if any, married \n\n[258 U.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n persons shall have in the property of each other, as an incident of the relation between them. It may give or withhold dower altogether; or it may for the security of titles, and the protection of innocent purchasers, provide that a nonresident woman whose very existence is probably unknown within the state, and is practically disavowed by the husband, shall not be entitled to dower of lands which he has disposed of without her concurrence or consent, and ostensibly as a single man.'\n\n The law thus declared has been the law of Oregon for 65 years.\n There is a distinction between dower created by the parties and that given by law and the latter 'it is believed to be the only kind which ever obtained in this country.' Randall v. Kreiger, 23 Wall. 137, 148 (23 L. Ed. 124). Expressing the power of the Legislature over it the court said:\n'During the life of the husband the right is a mere expectancy or possibility. In that condition of things, the law making power may deal with it as may be deemed proper. It is not a natural right. It is wholly given by law, and the power that gave it may increase, diminish, or otherwise alter it, or wholly take it away. It is upon the same footing with the expectancy of heirs, apparent or presumptive, before the death of the ancestor. Until that event occurs the law of descent and distribution may be molded according to the will to the Legislature.'\n\n The ruling is a deduction or incident of the more general principle expressed in Kerr v. Moon, 9 Wheat. 565, 569 (6 L. Ed. 161):\n'That the title to, and the disposition of real property, must be exclusively subject to the laws of the country where it is situated.'\n\n And this was so considered and the case cited in Thomas v. Woods, 173 Fed. 585, 593, 97 C. C. A. 535, 543 (26 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1180, 19 Ann. Cas. 1080), along with a number of other cases, to sustain the court in the declaration and decision that--\n'The right of dower in real property is determined by the laws of the state in which the property is situated.' \n\n[258 U.S. 314, 321]\n\u00a0\n From these cases it results, as said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that--\n\n'The Legislature having the power to give or withhold dower, it follows that it has the power to declare the manner in which the dower right may be barred, or the grounds upon which it may be forfeited, and, if so, it has the right to provide that it may be barred by the wife's nonresidence in the state.'\n\n The action of the court affirming the decree of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pratt v.

U S(1922)\nNo. 207\nArgued: April 21, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n - \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 297]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Sutherland, Simon Lyon, and R. B. H. Lyon, all of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland to recover the sum of $8,300, being the aggregate of amounts paid as bankers' special taxes for the years 1898 to 1901, under section 2 of the Spanish War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448. The company applied on November 22, 1913, for a refund, pursuant to the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240, alleging that the taxes had been assessed and collected on plaintiff's capital, but that in fact none of it had been used or employed in the banking business. The application was rejected by the Secretary of the Treasury on April 19, 1917, and this suit was begun on July 25, 1918. The government insisted that the taxes were legally payable, and also that the claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The court dismissed the petition without opinion on authority of Union Trust Co. of Indianapolis v. United States, 55 Ct. Cl. 424, and the case is here on appeal. A motion to remand for further findings of fact, made here by appellant earlier in this term, was denied without prejudice. 42 Sup. Ct. 183. \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n By the act of 1898 'bankers using or employing a capital not exceeding the sum of $25,000' were required to pay a special tax of $50, and for every additional $1,000 the further amount of $2. The act provided, among other things, that 'in estimating capital surplus shall be include,' and that 'every person, firm, or company, and every incorporated or other bank, having a place of business where credits are opened by the deposit or collection of money or currency' subject to check, are to be deemed bankers. The Fidelity Company was unquestionably a banker; but banking was only one of four departments of its business. The others were: (a) The surety business-that is, acting as surety upon bonds conditioned for the faithful performance of duties by principals; (b) the safe-deposit business-that is, renting safe-deposit boxes for the safe-keeping of valuables; (c) the business of acting as trustee under bond issues of other corporations. Whether the company had used or employed its capital in the banking business, within the meaning of the act of 1898, is the main question presented.\n The tax paid upon capital used or employed in banking was assessed for the year 1898 upon $25,000, for 1899 upon $1,125,000, and for 1900 and 1901 upon $1,500,000. The company claimed that it had not used any of its capital in banking during any of those years, and duly requested the lower court to find as facts that:\n'The entire business of the banking department was conducted solely on its depositors' money. Neither the capital stock nor surplus of plaintiff company was used or employed by or in the banking department.'\n\n The court made no specific finding on that subject, and it overruled the motion for a new trial, in the supplement to which the company renewed its application for such findings, and also requested other specific findings in support of them. In the motion made here to remand the case for further findings \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n of fact the company requested that the Court of Claims be directed to find from the evidence: (1) Whether or not the banking department used only the funds of its depositors in the conduct of the business of that department; ( 2) whether or not any of the capital or surplus of the company was actually used or employed in the banking business, and, if so, what amount; and (3) what was the net income of appellants' surety or bonding department during each of the years in question. The court had already found the annual net income of the banking department, and it was asserted that in volume and profits the surety business was far more important than that of banking. If specific findings on these subjects are necessary to a proper determination of the case, it should clearly be remanded for that purpose, since the requests therefor was made seasonably in the lower court and here.\n The government contends that the findings requested are immaterial, because, as matter of law, all of the capital (and surplus) was used or employed in banking. It argues that the words used and employed are not to be given the same meaning; that all the company's capital was, as matter of law, employed in the banking business, because all of it was, as matter of law, available for use in the banking department; and that all of it must in fact have enhanced the credit of the banking department, even if none of it was actually used in banking and the income of the banking department was derived directly from the investment of its deposits. In other words, the contention is that the act fixes the tax upon the banker 'using or employing' a capital, and that a firm, or company, being a banker, cannot escape, or reduce, the tax by showing that it is engaged in several lines of business and that, in fact, none, or only a part, of its capital was used specifically in its banking operations.\n The findings of fact made by the Court of Claims were these: The company's capital stock and the surplus were \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n each $1,000,000 in 1898. Both were increased from time to time. In 1901 the former was $2,000,000, the latter $2,550,000. All the money derived from the sale of the capital stock and all the money of the surplus were permanently invested in real estate (including the office building at Baltimore in which the company's business was done) and in bonds, stocks and other securities. These investments were referred to and were designated on its books as 'Capital Stock Investments.' The securities and valuable papers representing them were segregated in a separate compartment of the company's vault in separate envelopes earmarked as capital stock. The financial operations concerning them were kept in a separate set of books distinct from the records of all other business transacted by the company. The business of the banking department was likewise kept separate, physically and as a matter of accounting, from all other business of the company; and the record of its operations was kept in a distinct set of books. The money received from deposits (which in 1901 exceeded $4,000,000) was invested in stocks and bonds which were kept in the vault in separate envelopes earmarked as such. The expenses of each department of the company's business were charged to the separate account of that department payable out of its earning. But physically expenses of the several departments may have been paid from a common fund. A part of the income from each department was maintained as cash and remained uninvested, part of the money being carried by the respective departments as counter cash and the balance being deposited in the company's various depositaries. The money so deposited was not segregated according to the source from which it came, though the source of the items comprising its total amount was recorded in the respective books of each department. The earnings of each department were carried to the undivided profits account of the company at the end of each year. \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n A portion of the office building was occupied by the banking department.\n We cannot, on these findings of fact, say, as matter of law, that all the capital of the Fidelity Company was used in the banking business; nor can we say that at least the amount upon which the tax was assessed (which in no year was as much as one-half the company's capital) was so used. Capital may be employed in banking although it is not used strictly as working capital and none of it is used in making loans or directly in other banking transactions. Money of a banker held in the vault or with depositaries as a reserve is employed in banking as much as money loaned to customers. Capital invested in securities may be employed in banking even if its sole use is to give to the banker the credit which attracts depositors or to make it possible for him otherwise to raise money with which banking operations are conducted. And if such securities serve to give credit, they will continue, also in the legal sense, to be capital used in the banking business, even if they are designated by the company as assests of another department and physically segregated as such. Compare Canal Co. v. New Orleans, \n99 U.S. 97\n. If a company is engaged exclusively in banking, all of its capital, however invested, may reasonably be held to be capital employed in banking without enquiry into the particular use to which it is put. Compare Leather Manufacturers' National Bank v. Treat %(c. c.) 116 f\/ed. 774; Id., 128 Fed. 262, 62 C. C. A. 644. But where a company is lawfully engaged in several distinct businesses to the successful conduct of each of which credit is necessary, and the company's capital supplies such credit to each, the whole of this common capital cannot be deemed capital of a single department. Under such circumstances charges incident to common capital are, in accounting practice, apportioned ordinarily among the several departments, and it may not be assumed that Congress in laying this tax intended to depart from the usage of business. \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n With the apportionment of charges incident to capital used in common by several departments or branches of a business, both courts and legislatures have become familiar. Such apportionment is made when the tangible property of a corporation is scattered through different states and its intangible property is treated, for purposes of taxation, as distributed among the several states in which the tangible property is located. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 U.S. 194\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 305; Id., \n166 U.S. 185\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 604; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 U.S. 450\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 373; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 U.S. 165\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 62. Statutes are common by which foreign corporations are taxed upon the amount of their capital employed within the taxing state. Would it be contended that all the capital of the foreign corporation was taxable in each such state, because all of its capital is conceivably available for use in each and all is liable for debts incurred in each? The act of 1898 applies to individual bankers as well as to corporations. Surely Congress could not have intended to tax as capital employed in banking the whole net property of an individual banker. Yet the possession of large wealth would probably aid him in attracting depositors, and all his property would, if required, be available legally, and possibly in fact, to meet requirements of his banking business. That apportionment of the capital of a company among its several departments can and should be made for purposes of taxation has been held by lower courts in cases arising under section 3 of the Act of Congress October 22, 1914, c. 331, 38 Stat. 745, 750, which is substantially the same as the provision here in question. \n1\n They recognize that \n\n[259 U.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n the question whether the capital was used in the banking business, and if so to what extent, is a question of fact.\n On the facts found by the Court of Claims we are unable to say that no part of the capital was used in the banking business or that there was used at least as much thereof as was represented by the taxes assessed. It follows that in order to determine what sums, if any, are recoverable, additional facts must be found. The request for further findings made by appellant was appropriate, and the case should be remanded, with directions to make such findings, unless, as the government contends, the claim sued on is barred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n The contention is that the cause of action accrued on May 22, 1914, which is six months after presentation of the claim to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; that the two-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 3227 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5950) applies; that the fact that the claim was not rejected by the Treasury Department until April, 1917, is immaterial; and that therefore the suit, which was begun in July, 1918, is barred. This was the view taken by the Court of Claims for reasons theretofore given in Kahn v. United States, 55 Ct. Cl. 271. But, as we held in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 415, the six-year statute of limitations applies to cases arising under the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256. See also Henry, Executor, v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 393, 394\n, 40 S. Sup.

US(1922)\nNo. 208\nArgued: April 21, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. George Sutherland, Simon Lyon, and R. B. H. Lyon, all of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[259 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the Fidelity Title & Trust Company, of Pittsburgh, in July, 1918, to recover the sum of $10,028. 94, assessed upon its whole capital and undivided profits and paid as bankers' special taxes under section 2 of the Spanish War Revenue Act (30 Stat. 448). That court entered judgment for the defendant, and the case is here on appeal. Appellant contends that nothing was payable as a tax, because none of the capital or undivided profits was used or employed in banking, and that the tax was, in no event, assessable on the undivided profits, because these were not a part of the capital within the meaning of the act. The government contends that the whole capital and undivided profits were taxable, and that, in any event, the action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations, because the application for refund had been made in November, 1913. In the main, the facts are similar to, and the questions of law are the same as, those considered in Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. United States, \n259 U.S. 296\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 511, 66 L. Ed. --, decided this day. For the reasons there stated we hold that the action was not barred. As bearing upon the merits material differences in the facts must be considered. In the case now under consideration, the businesses and the assets of the several departments were not separated, and there was not technically a surplus, but a fund designated as undivided profits.\n The company carried on five classes of business, one of which was banking. An amount in excess of its capital was permanently invested in bonds and real estate, the latter including its office building. A schedule of these investments was carried on the books designated 'Schedule \n\n[259 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n of Investments of the Capital Stock of One Million Dollars'; but there was no physical segregation of these assets from others belonging to the company. Nor was there segregation of the money received from the capital stock, or from investments made therewith, from the money derived from earnings of the several departments. No attempt was made to segregate or earmark investments as having been made for any particular department. All moneys received by the company, including bank deposits, were commingled, and from these general funds all investments were made, and all expenses and losses were paid. The office building was used by all the departments. All the earnings from the several departments were pooled, and went into the profit and loss account. There was carried in this account a credit representing undivided profits amounting in 1898 to $414,468.86, which increased from year to year, and was $948,074.56 in 1902. These undivided profits were not at any time during the period in question set apart in any way as a separate fund, and they were at all times subject to distribution by the board of directors as dividends and available for any department of the business. At a date subsequent to the period here in question additional stock was sold above par to form a surplus fund.\n The burden lay on the plaintiff to establish that none of the company's capital, or that less of it than the amount for which it was assessed, had been used or employed in the banking department. It failed entirely to sustain that burden. The proportions of capital and accumulated profits used in the respective departments was not established by the evidence. There was no finding that the net profits of the banking department were received solely from the use of depositors' money; and there does not appear to have been any request for a finding of fact that no part of the capital and undivided profits was used in banking, or for a finding of acts from \n\n[259 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n which the proportion so used, if any, could be determined. Therefore the Court of Claims properly denied recovery for any part of the taxes paid, unless we can say, as matter of law, that undivided profits, on which for the years 1898 and 1901 taxes were assessed as upon capital, were not assessable as such.\n The act declares that, 'in estimating capital, surplus shall be included,' and that the 'annual tax shall in all cases be computed on the basis of the capital and surplus for the preceding fiscal year.' The act does not mention undivided profits. The question is whether Congress intended to draw a distinction between surplus and undivided profits, or intended that all capital actually used in banking should be taxed, whether it was strictly capital stock, or surplus or undivided profits.\n The company argues that, while the word 'surplus,' in its general and popular meaning, includes undivided profits, Congress in the act of 1898 used the term in its technical and restricted sense of a fund formally set apart and called surplus by the authorized officers of the bank, and that, as matter of law, no tax can be assessed on undivided profits. This view finds support in opinions of the Attorney General rendered in 1899 and 1900. 22 Ops. Attys. Gen. 320; 23 Ops. Attys. Gen. 341. But his rulings were not acquiesced in by the Treasury Department. It recommended promptly an amendment of the act, which should expressly declare that undivided profits were to be considered surplus (Annual Reports of Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1899, p. 91; Id., 1900, p. 89), and it submitted the question thereafter to the courts for determination. In Leather Manufacturers' National Bank v. Treat, 116 Fed. 774 (1902), the Circuit Court held that undivided profits were subject to taxation, and the judgment in that case was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 128 Fed. 262, 62 C. C. A. 644 (1904). \n\n[259 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n With these courts we agree. By the act of 1898 Congress imposed the tax, not on incorporated banks only, but also on any person, firm, or company engaged in banking; and it measured the tax by the amount of capital actually used or employed in banking. The technical distinction between capital, surplus, and undivided profits is obviously not applicable to the banking business when conducted by individuals or firms; and the distinction between surplus and undivided profits, while commonly observed by incorporated banks, is not ordinarily made by other business corporations. As it is the use or employment of capital in banking, not mere possession thereof by the banker, which determines the amount of the tax, the fact that a portion of the capital so used or employed is designated undivided profits is of no legal significance. \n1\n Compare Fidelity & Deposit Company v. United States, \n259 U.S. 296\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 511, 66 L. Ed. --, decided this day.\n But while capital assets of a banker are not, as matter of law, exempt from taxation under the act of 1898 merely because they are designated undivided profits, undivided profits like any other part of the company's capital, may be free from the tax, because they were not, in fact, used or employed in banking. And the company contends that the Court of Claims did find as a fact that these undivided profits were not so used. The passage in the findings relied upon is this:\n'The said profit and loss credit balance was never designated as or set apart or appropriated to capital or surplus of used for capital or surplus purposes.'\n\n It is argued that the last clause of the sentence means that none of the undivided profits were used for banking purposes. The contention is plausible. But, \n\n[259 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n when the passage is read in connection with other parts of the findings, it seems clear that such was not the meaning of the court. There was thus no finding to the effect that the undistributed profits, as distinguished from capital, were not used or employed in banking.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act Oct. 2, 1914, c. 331, 38 Stat. 745, 750, provides in terms that undivided profits shall be included in capital.

MOTT IRON WORKS(1922)\nNo. 159\nArgued: March 10, 1922Decided: March 20, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. John F. Williams, of Aiken, S. C., and William S. Nelson, of Columbia, S. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. P. F. Henderson and D. S. Henderson, both of Aiken, S. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the petitioner upon a written guaranty of payment to the respondent of $2,363.50 for goods sold to the Kaiser Company. The plaintiff (the respondent) had a verdict and judgment and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. J. L. Mott Iron Works v. Kaiser Co. (S. C.) 103 S. E. 783. The case comes here on the question of the liability of the bank, upon the facts that we shall state.\n They are simple. A firm of McGhee and McGhee was building a hospital in Aiken. The firm had contracted with the Kaiser Company for the heating and plumbing, at the price of $7,800, the firm agreeing to pay eighty-five \n\n[258 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of the labor and materials furnished each month and the remaining fifteen at the completion of the system. The Kaiser Company assigned this contract to the bank and the firm agreed to make all checks under the contract payable to the bank. This was done as security to the bank for advances the validity of which is not contested. In the course of performance the Kaiser Company ordered the goods concerned from the respondent, but the respondent required security before it would send them. Thereupon the bank in order to enable the company to complete its contract and thereby to repay the advances that the bank had made gave the guaranty in question. Subsequently the bank received $1,105.28 and might have received much more than the amount of its guaranty although in fact it allowed the McGhees to pay checks for $5,468 to the Kaiser Company, with the result that the Kaiser Cimpany still owes it some money. Therefore the bank is in the position of having realized the benefit to acquire which the guaranty was made, and of having realized it out of the proceeds of the goods that it induced the Iron Company to sell.\n In such circumstances, whether the contract is valid or not, the contractor is accountable to the contractee, up to the amount of his undertaking, for the proceeds coming to his hands from the contractee upon the inducement of the contract. Citizens' Central National Bank v. Appleton, \n216 U.S. 196\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 364. In this case therefore the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount for which it has declared, and as the case was fully tried upon the merits, the distinction between a recovery on the guaranty, as having been necessarily incident to the business of banking, and a recovery of the amount received by petitioner on account of the guaranty, becomes purely formal.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE was absent and took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT BANK OF GULFPORT, MISS, v.

Harris, of Jackson, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is a national bank located at Gulfport, Harrison county, Miss. The state revenue agent instructed the tax collector for that county as follows:\n'The following described property, in said county, to wit: Capital stock, surplus, undivided profits, and any and all other property properly assessable to banks, amounting to $75,150, belonging to and owned by First National Bank of Gulfport has escaped taxation during each of the years of 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907, by reason of not being assessed.\n\n'You are, by virtue of the Annotated Code of Mississippi of 1906, chapter 131, section 4740, now notified and required to, within ten days hereafter, make the proper assessment of said property by way of an additional assessment, on the roll or tax list in your hands, and to give ten days' notice in writing to said First National Bank, whose property is so assessed, and also notify in writing the board of supervisors of said county of said assessment.'\n\n In obedience to this instruction, the collector entered upon the rolls of his office an assessment to the bank in these words:\n'Amount of all other personal property not otherwise mentioned, $174, 000.'\n\n Objection was duly offered upon the ground that the corporation was assessed, and not the stockholders, as required by section 5219, Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  9784). The Harrison county circuit court overruled this and directed the board of supervisors--- \n\n[258 U.S. 362, 364]\n\u00a0\n 'to assess the First National Bank of Gulfport, Mississippi, with capital stock, surplus, undivided profits, and any and all property assessable to said bank, in the sum of $75,150, for the years 1903, 1906, and 1907, which said property was at said time owned by said First National Bank, and which had escaped taxation for each of the years as hereinbefore set out; and said board of supervisors is hereby directed to make such assessment by way of additional assessment on the roll and tax list of Harrison county, Mississippi.'\n The Supreme Court of the state approved this judgment.

Adams, 123 Miss. 279, 85 South 308.\n Section 52191 Revised Statutes (copied below), prescribes the full measure of the power of the several states to impose taxes upon national banking associations or their stockholders.

Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 664, 676\n, 677 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 537, a tax levied upon a corporation measured by the value of its shares is not equivalent to one upon the shareholders in respect of their shares.\n Where the validity of an assessment by officers of the state is properly challenged, and the matter comes here, this court must determine the effect of the thing actually done. What might have been done under the local statute is not controlling. We think it clear that the assessment in the present case was against the corporation and beyond the power of the state definitely delimited by section 5219\n\n\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Nothing herein shall prevent all the shares in any association from being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the state within which the association is located; but the Legislature of each state may determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the shares of national banking association located within the state, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state, and that the shares of any national banking association owned by non-residents of any state shall be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere.

The Supreme Court of Florida sustained the declaration, 77 Fla. 742, 82 South. 346, but on the day of the decision the Legislature passed an act, chapter 7865, Acts of 1919, that purported to validate the collection. The act was pleaded. The plaintiff demurred setting up \n\n[258 U.S. 338, 339]\n\u00a0\n Article 1, Section 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, but the Supreme Court rendered judgment for the defendant on the ground that the plea was good. Bd. of Com'rs of Everglades Drainage Dist. v. Forbes Pioneer Boat Line, 80 Fla. 252, 86 South. 199.\n Stripped of conciliatory phrases the question is whether a state legislature can take away from a private party a right to recover money that is due when the act is passed. The argument that prevailed below was based on the supposed analogy of United States v. Heinszen, \n206 U.S. 370\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688 (Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co. [December 5, 1921] \n257 U.S. 226\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 71), which held the Congress could ratify the collection of a tax that had been made without authority of law. That analogy, however, fails. A tax may be imposed in respect of past benefits, so that if instead of calling it a ratification Congress had purported to impose the tax for the first time the enactment would have been within its power. Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 216\n, 217 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 66. Stockdale v. Atlantic Ins. Co., 20 Wall. 323. But generally ratification of an act is not good if attempted at a time when the ratifying authority could not lawfully do the act. Bird v. Brown, 4 Exch, 786, 799. If we apply that principle this statute is invalid. For if the Legislature of Florida had attempted to make the plaintiff pay in 1919 for passages through the lock of a canal, that took place before 1917, without any promise of reward, there is nothing in the case as it stands to indicate that it could have done so any more effectively than it could have made a man pay a baker for a gratuitous deposit of rolls.\n It is true that the doctrine of ratification has been carried somewhat beyond the point that we indicate, in regard to acts done in the name of the Government by those who assume to represent it. Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549, 556\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 585. It is true also that when rights are asserted on the ground of some slight technical defect or contrary to some strongly prevailing view of justice, Courts have \n\n[258 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n allowed them to be defeated by subsequent legislation and have used various circumlocutions, some of which are collected in Danforth v. Groton Water Works, 178 Mass. 472, 477, 59 N. E. 1033, 86 Am. St. Rep. 495; Dunbar v. Boston & Providence R. R. Corp., 181 Mass. 383, 385, 63 N. E. 916. In those cases it is suggested that the meaning simply is that constitutional principles must leave some play to the joints of the machine.\n But Courts can not go very far against the literal meaning and plain intent of a constitutional text. Defendant owed the plaintiff a definite sum of money that it had extorted from the plaintiff without right. It is hard to find any ground for saying that the promise of the law that the public force shall be at the plaintiff's disposal is less absolute than it is when the claim is for goods sold. Yet no one would say that a claim for goods sold could be abolished without compensation. It would seem from the first decision of the Court below that the transaction was not one for which payment naturally could have been expected. To say that the Legislature simply was establishing the situation as both parties knew from the beginning it ought to be would be putting something of a gloss upon the facts. We must assume that the plaintiff went through the canal relying upon its legal rights and it is not to be deprived of them because the Legislature forgot.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFREUND v.

After official advertisement, a bid was made by appellants April 4, 1911, and accepted April 20, 1911, for service on a particular route described by a schedule, for a certain annual gross sum, which being divided by the miles to be covered made a certain rate per mile. A contract was signed May 22d. The contract was for 4 years, beginning July 1, 1911. The route was for seven daily circuit trips from and back to the new St. Louis post office. That office was not ready for occupancy on July 1, 1911, or for 16 months thereafter, and the old post office, which was 13 blocks from the new one, continued to be used. The Post Office Department, relying on certain clauses in the contract, and upon a notice given to bidders, substituted another route and ordered the contractor to begin performance on July 1st, at what the department held to be the same rate per mile of service. The contractors protested, but threatened with suit upon their bond, performed the service and accepted periodical payments on the new route until October 28, 1912, the date of occupying the new post office, when the route bid upon and contracted for was initiated and the contractors did the work under it till the term ended. The cost to the contractors of doing the work on the substitute route was $43,726.89, \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n and they were paid by the government $24,289.62. Thus their loss was in round numbers $19,500 during the 16 months of the substituted route. After October 12, 1912, on the original route the contractors made a profit of 42 per cent. on its cost in what remained of the term.\n The contractors' claim was that the substitution of the new route for the one they bid on was not within the terms of the contract, but was unconscionable, and that they were entitled to recover for the work done on the new route on a quantum meruit. The Court of Claims (56 Ct. Cl. 15) held that it was not necessary to determine whether the new route was properly substituted for the old, because the contractors had acquiesced in this view by their performance, but that the government had not, in adapting the mileage rate of the original route under the contract to the new route, done justice to the contractors in the number of miles allowed, and on this basis gave judgment for $7,346.66. From this the contractors appealed. The government brings a cross-appeal, claiming that, as the contractors accepted full pay under the contract as construed and expressed by the department, they should recover nothing.\n It is, of course, wise and necessary that government agents in binding their principal in contracts for construction or service should make provision for alterations in the plans, or changes in the service, within the four corners of the contract, and thus avoid the presentation of unreasonable claims for extras. This court has recognized that necessity and enforced various provisions to which it has given rise. But sometimes such contract provisions have been interpreted and enforced by executive officials as if they enabled those officers to remold the contract at will. The temptation of the bureau to adopt such clauses arises out of the fact that they avoid the necessity of labor, foresight, and care in definitely drafting the contract, and reserve power in the bureau. This does \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n not make for justice, it promotes the possibility of official favoritism as between contractors, and results in enlarged expenditures, because it increases the prices which contractors, in view of the added risk, incorporate in their bids for government contracts. These considerations, especially the first, have made this court properly attentive to any language or phrase of these enlarging provisions which may be properly held to limit their application to what should be regarded as having been fairly and reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into. These observations are justified and illustrated by decisions of this court in United States v. Stage Co., \n199 U.S. 414\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 69, and Hunt Ex'rs v. United States, \n257 U.S. 125\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 5.\n The Court of Claims, after giving the two schedules in full, sums up the contrast between them as follows:\n'The service bid upon was a circuit service on seven circuits, on a mileage basis, each circuit beginning and ending at the new post office and for which the contractor was paid for every mile traveled regardless of the quantity of mail carried or whether for any part of the distance no mail was carried. The restated service [i. e., on the new route] was a trip service for which payment was made on a mileage basis when mail was carried, but no payment was made for a return trip if mail was not carried, or for distance traveled by empty vehicles in going to a point from which mail was to be moved.\n\n'The service bid upon involved the handling of the mails for a small area and was a comparatively light service. The restated service required the hauling of incoming and outgoing mails for the entire city and involved handling several times the weight of mail. The service bid on required 6 automobiles. The restated service required 18 wagons of different capacity exceeding several times in aggregate capacity that required for the bid on the service. The mileage of each wagon, when carrying \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n mail was allowed and paid for. The larger bulk of mail required proportionately more time in loading and unloading.\n\n'The bid upon service, with the exception of one early trip on each of these circuits, was all to be performed within 12 hours from approximately 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. The restated service required trips during practically every hour of the 24.'\n\n By a note in the advertisement, by paragraph 10 in the contract, and by further somewhat more elaborate stipulation in the contract, provision was made for changes. The last contained all that was in the others and was as follows:\n'It is hereby stipulated and agreed by said contractors and their sureties that the Postmaster General may change the schedule, vary, increase or decrease the trips on this route, or extend the trips to any new location of the post offices, railroad stations, steamboat landings, mail stations, or points of exchange, with cable or electric cars named in the schedule for service for said route, in said advertisement, establish service to and from like offices, stations landings, or points not named therein, and vary, increase, or decrease the trips thereto, and discontinue service between any of the post offices, railroad stations, steamboat landings, mail stations, or points of exchange with electric or cable cars, or between any of them: Provided, that for any increase or decrease in the service authorized by the Second Assistant Postmaster General, the pay of the contractors shall be increased, as the case may be, at the rate per mile of travel agreed to be paid for service under this contract, as shown by the annual rate of compensation and the annual miles of travel, based on the frequency and distances shown in the schedule of service for said route in said advertisement.'\n\n There are two limitations in this very broad provision which deserve notice. One is that the offices, stations, \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n landings, and points, not named in the schedule, to and from which the Postmaster General was permitted to establish service, were to be like those named in the schedule, and the other is that the substituted service was to be such that the method of fixing pay in the original contract could be applied to it. Now it is clear to us that the substituted route did not establish a route to like stations and points. The findings give the two schedules and we reproduce them in the margins. \n1\n An examination\n[]\n Number Number Total of trips of Number From- By- To- Distance. daily trips of Running except on trips time.

The other was the heavy work of transporting all the arriving and departing mail of the city from the railway stations to the old post office and back again. On the one, the contractors received pay for every mile traveled. On the other, the pay was made dependent on the carriage of mail and no empty trips of going or returning were included in the mileage paid for, although the schedule made many of them necessary. It is impossible, therefore, save by forcing, to adapt the rate per mile of one route to the other. What has been said shows how different was the equipment needed, how variant the tonnage carried, what disparity between the hours of readiness required, and the differing methods of calculating compensation. This substituted route was undoubtedly necessary in the transportation of mails in the city of St. Louis, but it was for a different purpose from that of the original route. The department merely took advantage of general words in the appellants' contract to meet an emergency presented by the delay in finishing the new post office and the refusal of another contractor to continue this indispensable service beyond his term, to thrust this entirely new task upon the appellants here.\n It is sought in the argument for the government to distinguish this case from the Stage Company Case and the Hunt Case, on the ground that in them the compensation was for a lump sum, and the new work required was not to be paid for at all, while here the additional or variant work was to be done at a rate of so many cents per mile. We do not think this is a real difference. The radical change made in the character of the work to be done on the substituted route and the wholly inadequate price to be paid for it as found by the Court of Claims make the injustice just as clear as in the cited cases. We hold that the substitution of the new route and schedule for the one bid upon was not within the terms of the contract. \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n But it is said that, in view of the attitude of the government, the conduct of the contractors constituted such an acceptance of the new route as within the original contract as to rebut any implication of a different contract for a reasonable price on the part of the government. Consideration of this argument requires a review of the circumstances. The findings show that the advertisement for bids referred bidders to the city postmaster for any additional information concerning the matter, and that he advised these contractors when they doubted whether they could get their equipment ready by July 1st, that the new post office could not be completed at that time, that the work bid for could not begin then, and that the department would take care of the situation. They, thereupon, made their bid, accompanying it as required with a bond for $25,000. The bid was accepted by the department with a special notice as to the necessity of being ready with equipment July 1st, and inclosing the contract. The city postmaster being applied to again by the anxious bidders assured them that the matter would be adjusted in due time and urged them to sign the contract. Accordingly, on May 23d, the contractors signed and forwarded the contract to the department, with a request for extension of time. This was denied, and on application to the department June 20th for relief, because of the assurance of the postmaster, they were told that they would be given a substituted route then in the course of preparation. They objected that they could not prepare for this substituted route, which as already said was a mere continuance of old service by another contractor. They were told that they must be ready for the restated route at the time appointed and on June 30th they were furnished with a schedule of the new service. The contractors protested to the Second Assistant Postmaster General, to the postmaster at St. Louis, and to one Porter, a representative of the department at \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis, saying that they were not required to perform this service by the terms of the contract, because it was entirely different from that contemplated, and that they would be ruined financially. Porter, whose authority is not otherwise shown, told them that his business was to see that the service commenced on July 1st, and, if they did not begin, the contract would be readvertised, and they would be sued on their bond. The contractors then hired the equipment and outfit of the old contractor, with the result, already stated, that they lost $19,500 in 16 months.\n We think that there was no acceptance of the new route under the circumstances which would bar a recovery for what the services were reasonably worth. The Hunt Case was not a stronger case than this, and in the Stage Company Case the right to recover for work not properly and legally included in the contract was not even questioned, although in both cases the work demanded was done and periodical payments accepted. It is said on behalf of the government that those cases are to be distinguished from this because the contractor was in the midst of his work under his contract, and he could not be expected to throw it up, with all the uncertainties and certain losses he would sustain, while here the contractors had not begun work or extended preparation. But, while the cases are different, the difficulties faced by the contractors here were quite as formidable. They had been nursed into making the bid and giving the bond by the assurance as to the possible date of beginning the contract by the postmaster to whom they had been officially referred for information. They thus became bound under their bond to sign and complete the contract before they had been otherwise advised as to the actual date when their service would begin. At the time the contract was executed the department had formed the purpose to thrust on the contractors this burdensome route, but it \n\n[260 U.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n did not advise them of it until 10 days before July 1st, and, indeed, did not give them the exact schedule until the day before they were to begin it. Then the only course open to them was either to engage the old contractor's equipment at a heavy loss, or throw up the original contract and run the risk of the government's reletting at a higher bid, and charging the possible heavy difference in cost to it against them on their bond for a 5-year contract. We cannot ignore the suggestion of duress there was in the situation, or the questionable fairness of the conduct of the government, aside from the illegality of the construction of the contract insisted on, and have no difficulty, therefore, in distinguishing this case from the so-called Railroad Mail Cases (Eastern R. R. Co. v. United States, \n129 U.S. 391\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 220; C., M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n198 U.S. 385\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 665; Atchison Railway v. United States, \n225 U.S. 640\n, 32 Sup.

Ct. 209, decided by this court February 27, 1922), which are cited on behalf of the United States.\n We think that the contractors are entitled to recover the reasonable value of their services for the 16 months, including a fair profit.\n This relieves us of considering the conclusion reached by the Court of Claims.\n The judgment is reversed, the cross-appeal of the United States is dismissed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Claims, with directions to find the value of the services rendered by appellants on the substituted or restated route, including a fair profit, and to enter judgment for the balance found due. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Route No. 445004.

CITY OF GALVESTON(1922)\nNo. 455\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 388, 389]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. E. Tucker, of Boston, Mass., for appellant.\n Messrs. Frank S. Anderson and James W. Wayman, both of Galveston, Tex ., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The street railway system of Galveston was started as a horse car line in 1881. It was electrified about 1890, and after the hurricane of 1900 was largely rebuilt. Upon sale on foreclosure the railway passed in 1901 to a new company, and in 1905 it was purchased by the Galveston Electric Company, which supplies to the inhabitants of the city also electric light and power. At no time has the full fare on the railway been more than 5 cents- \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n except during the period of 8 months, from October 1, 1918, to June 5, 1919, when 6 cents was charged. This higher fare was authorized by ordinance of the municipal board of commissioners, which possesses regulatory powers; and on June 5, 1919, the same board reduced the maximum fare to 5 cents. The latter ordinance was passed after a hearing and a finding by the board that with the reduced rate the company would continue to earn a fair return. Under the 1919 ordinance the company operated for 11 months. Then it brought this suit, in the federal court for Southern Texas, to enjoin its enforcement. The company contends that the fare prescribed is confiscatory, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; the city, that it is sufficient to yield a return of 8 per cent. on the value of the property used in the public service.\n A temporary injunction having been denied, the court appointed a master to take the evidence and make advisory findings. There was substantially no dispute concerning the facts past or present. It was assumed, in view of then prevailing money rates, that 8 per cent. was a fair return upon money invested in the business. The experts agreed on what they called the estimated undepreciated cost of reproduction on the historical basis; that is, what the property ought to have cost on the basis of prices prevailing at the time the system and its various units were constructed. They agreed also on the amount of gross revenue, and on the expenditures made in operation and for taxes, except as hereinafter stated. The differences between the parties resulted mainly, either from differences in prophecy as to the future trend of prices or from differences in legal opinion as to the elements to be considered in determining whether a fair return would be earned. These differences affected both the base value and the amount to be deemed net revenues. The master, who heard the case in October, 1920, and \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n filed his report in November, made findings in which he advised that the fare was confiscatory. The District Judge, who heard the case in January, 1921, found a much smaller base value and much larger net revenues; stated that he did not deem it necessary to determine whether the ordinance 'will produce exactly 8 per cent. or a little more or a little short of it'; declared that he was 'not satisfied that the ordinance produces a return so plainly inadequate as to justify this court in interfering with the action of the municipality in the exercise of its rate-making function'; and in March, 1921, entered a decree dismissing the bill without prejudice. In April he denied a petition for rehearing. 272 Fed. 147. The case comes here on appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215.)\n The undepreciated reproduction cost on the historical basis1-which seems to be substantially equivalent to what is often termed the prudent investment2-was agreed to be $1,715,825. The parties failed to agree in their estimates of the depreciation accrued up to 1921. The master estimated that, based on the 1913 price level, it was $390,000; and this estimate the court accepted. Thus measured, the value of the property, less depreciation, was $1,325,825. The court found that the net earnings under the five-cent fare for the year ending June 30, 1920, \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n had been $90,159, and for the year ending December 31, 1920, $109,286, and estimated that for the year ending June 30, 1921, it would be at least $ 111,285. The return so found for the year ending June 30, 1920, is 6.8 per cent. of $1,325,825; for the calendar year 1920, 8.2 per cent., and for the year ending June 30, 1921, 8.4 per cent. The master made calculations only for the year ending June 30, 1920, and, mainly3 because he allowed an amount for maintenance and depreciation equal to nearly 18 per cent. of the prudent investment for the depreciable property (less accrued depreciation), found the net earnings to be only $50,249.60. This sum is 3. 8 per cent. on the prudent investment value, less depreciation. But neither the District Judge nor the master reached his conclusion as to net return by a calculation as simple as that indicated above.\n First. As the base value of the property, master and court took- instead of the prudent investment value-the estimated cost of reproduction at a later time less depreciation; and in estimating reproduction cost both refused to use as a basis the prices actually prevailing at the time of the hearings. There had risen to 110 per cent. above those of 1913. The basis for calculating reproduction cost adopted by all was prophecy as to the future general price level of commodities, labor, and money. This predicted level, which they assumed would be stable for an indefinite period, they called the new plateau of prices. As to the height of this prophesied plateau there was naturally wide differgence of opinion. The company's expert prophesied that the level would be 60 to 70 per cent. about 1913 prices; the master that an increase of 33 1\/3 per cent. would prove fair; and the court accepted \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 393]\n\u00a0\n the master's prophecy of 33 1\/3 per cent. \n4\n Thus both master and court assumed a reproduction cost, after deducting accrued depreciation, of about $1,625,000. On this sum the net earnings found by the court yielded- after deducting a 4 per cent. depreciation annuity on property subject to depreciation, a maintenance charge, and a charge for taxes, other than the federal income tax-a net return of 5 1\/2 per cent. for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920, of 6.7 per cent. for the calendar year 1920, and the promise of more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921. But to fix base value the master added, and the court disallowed, items aggregating nearly $ 600,000, which must now be considered.\n The most important of these items is $520,000 for 'development cost.' The item is called by the master also 'going concern value or values of plant in successful operation.' He could not have meant by this to cover the cost of establishing the system as a physically going concern, for the cost of converting the inert railway plant into an operating system is covered in the agreed historical value by items aggregating $202,000. These included, besides engineering, supervision, interest, taxes, law expenses, injuries and damages during construction, the sum of $73,281 for the expenses of organization and business management. The going concern value for which the master \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 394]\n\u00a0\n makes allowance is the cost of developing the operating railway system into a financially successful concern. The only evidence offered, or relied upon, to support his finding is a capitalization of the net balance of alleged past deficits in accordance with what was said to be the Wisconsin rule. \n5\n The experts calculated this sum in various ways. One estimate placed the development cost at $2,000,000; a more moderate estimate by the company's expert was $575,300; and the city's expert made a calculation by which he estimated this so-called cost at $212,452.\n If the rule were that a prescribed rate is to be held confiscatory in case net earnings are not sufficient to yield 8 per cent, on the amount prudently invested in the business, there might be propriety in counting as part of the investment such amount, if any, as was necessarily expended at the start in overcoming initial difficulties incident to operation and in securing patronage. But no evidence of any such expenditure was introduced; and the claim of the company does not proceed upon that basis. What was presented by the witnesses are studies, on various theories, of what past deficiencies in net income would aggregate, if 4 per cent. were allowed as a depreciation annuity and 8 per cent. compound interest were charged annually on the value of the property used. These calculations covered, on one basis, the period of 39 years since the original horse car line was built; on another, the period of 15 years since the appellant purchased the property as a going concern. If net deficits so estimated were made a factor in the rate base, recognition of 8 per cent. as a fair return on the continuing investment would imply substantially a guarantee by the community that the \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 395]\n\u00a0\n investor will net on his investment ultimately a return of 8 per cent. yearly, with interest compounded on deferred payments; provided only that the traffic will in course of time bear a rate high enough to produce that amount. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The fact that a utility may reach financial success only in time or not at all, is a reason for allowing a liberal return on the money invested in the interprise; but it does not make past losses an element to be considered in deciding what the base value is and whether the rate is confiscatory. A company which has failed to secure from year to year sufficient earnings to keep the investment unimpaired and to pay a fair return, whether its failure was the result of imprudence in engaging in the enterprise or of errors in management, or of omission to exact proper prices for its output, cannot erect out of past deficits a legal basis for holding confiscatory for the future, rates which would, on the basis of present reproduction value, otherwise be compensatory. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148.\n Nor is there evidence in the record to justify the master's finding that a business brought to successful operation 'should have a going concern value at least equal to one-third third of its physical properties.' Past losses obviously do not tend to prove present values. The fact that a sometime losing business becomes profitable eventually through growth of the community or more efficient management, tends to prove merely that the adventure was \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 396]\n\u00a0\n not wholly misconceived. It is doubtless true, as the master indicated, that a prospective purchaser of the Galveston system would be willing to pay more for it with a record of annual losses overcome, than he would if the losses had continued. But would not the property be, at least, as valuable if the past had presented a record of continuous successes? And shall the base value be deemed less in law if there was no development cost, because success was instant and continuous? Or, if the success had been so great that, besides paying an annual return at the rate of 8 per cent., a large surplus had been accumulated, could the city insist that the base value be reduced by the amount of the surplus? Compare Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., decided March 6, 1922, \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264, 66 L. Ed. --.\n In determining the value of a business as between buyer and seller, the good will and earning power due to effective organization are often more important elements than tangible property. Where the public acquires the business, compensation must be made for these, at least under some circumstances. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 203 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 615, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1084; National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 62 Fed. 853, 865, 10 C. C. A. 653, 27 L. R. A. 827. And they, like past losses, should be considered in determining whether a rate charged by a public utility is reasonable. Compare Venner v. Urbana Waterworks (C. C.) 174 Fed. 348, 352. But in determining whether a rate is confiscatory, good will and franchise value were excluded from the base value in Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 669\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389, and Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 169\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811; and the expressions in Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 184\n, 191 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 278, and in Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 267\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454, are not to be taken as modifying in any respect the rule there declared. Going concern value and development cost, in the sense in which the master used these terms \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 397]\n\u00a0\n are not to be included in the base value for the purpose of determining whether a rate is confiscatory.\n The other item included by the master in determining base value, but disallowed by the court, is $67,078 for brokerage fees. There is no evidence that any sum was in fact paid as brokerage, and there was included, as above shown, the sum of $73.281 for organization and business management in calculating the historical reproduction cost. The finding of the master rests upon testimony that bankers customarily get, in some form, compensation equal to 4 per cent. on the money procured by them for such enterprises. \n7\n But compensation for bankers' services is often paid in the lessened price at which they take the company's securities, and is thus represented in the higher rate of interest or dividend paid on the money actually received by the company as capital. The reason given by the master for including the allowance for an assumed brokerage fee, is that a brokerage fee is 'a normal incident of large industrial investments and has not been amortized,' since 'the record shows that the plant has been operated at a loss.' If base value were to be fixed by the money expended, brokerage fees actually paid might with propriety be included, as are taxes paid pending construction. But as the base value considered is the present value, that value must be measured by money; and the customary cost of obtaining the money is immaterial. We cannot say that the court erred in refusing to include in base value an allowance for hypothetical broker's fees.\n The appellants insisted also that the base value should be raised by assuming that the future plateau of prices would be 60 to 70 per cent. above the historical reproduction \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 398]\n\u00a0\n value instead of 33 1\/3 per cent. as the master and the court assumed. The appellees insisted, on the other hand, that an item of $142,281 for grade raising included by master and court in the historical cost should be eliminated. We cannot say that there was error in overruling these contentions.\n Second. Concerning deductions to be made from gross revenue in order to determine net earnings, the court differed from the master in regard both to the yearly charge for maintenance and to the depreciation annuity. It appeared that in the 15 years since appellant acquired the system in 1905, the average annual expenditure for maintenance had been $42,771; that during the war the property had been admittedly undermaintained; that the expenditure was $64,108 in the calendar year 1919, $80,322 in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920, and $90,861.28 in the calendar year 1920. The court estimated the proper charge for current maintenance at $70,000, and allowed, in addition, a depreciation annuity of $45,245 (that is, 4 per cent. on property subject to depreciation) to provide a fund out of which annual replacements and renewals could be made. Thus the court allowed for the year's depreciation and maintenance $115,245, which is nearly 14 per cent. of the historical reproduction value, and about 10 per cent, of the assumed reproduction cost, of the depreciable part of the system. The master allowed $147,146.40 for maintenance and depreciation during the year ending June 30, 1920. This larger figure was arrived at, partly by charging as cost of maintenance the full $80,322 expended during that year, and partly by including as depreciable property expenditures for overhead items which the court excluded. The proper annual charge for maintenance is the amount normally required for that purpose during the period; it is not necessarily the amount actually expended within the year. Many items included in the overhead cost of original construction \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 399]\n\u00a0\n may properly be excluded in calculating the amount of the depreciation annuity. We cannot say that the court erred in limiting the year's maintenance and depreciation allowances to an aggregate of $115,245.\n The company asked to have allowed as a further charge $29,500 a year on account of what it called deferred maintenance. The contention is that during the war and two years following, the company had deferred maintenance, pursuant to a policy established at the express request of the government, to the end that material and labor might be released for war purposes; that to make good this deferred maintenance would cost $197, 000; and that in order to amortize this amount an annual allowance from earnings of $29,500 should be made for five years. This is an attempt, in another form, to capitalize alleged past losses; and the request was properly refused both by the master and the court.\n Third. The remaining item as to which the master and the court differed relates to the income tax. The company assigns as error that the master allowed, but the court disallowed, as a part of the operating expenses for the year ending June 30, 1920, the sum of $16,254 paid by the company during that year for federal income taxes. The tax referred to is presumably that imposed by Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18,  230-238, 40 Stat. 1057, 1075-1080 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8nn-6336 1\/8rr), which for any year after 1918 is 10 per cent. of the net income. In calculating whether the 5-cent fare will yield a proper return, it is necessary to deduct from gross revenue the expenses and charges; and all taxes which would be payable if a fair return were earned are appropriate deductions. There is no difference in this respect between state and federal taxes or between income taxes and others. But the fact that it is the federal corporate income tax for which deduction is made, must be taken into consideration in determining what rate of return shall be deemed fair. For under section 219 the stockholder \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 400]\n\u00a0\n does not include in the income on which the normal federal tax is payable dividends received from the corporation. This tax exemption is therefore, in effect, part of the return on the investment. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n It is thus clear that both in the year ending June 30, 1920, and in the calendar year 1920, the net earnings of the system were less than 8 per cent. of its value, whether the value be estimated on the basis of prudent investment or on the basis of the reproduction cost actually adopted. When the court rendered its decision the ordinance had been tested for more than a year and a half-a period ample in ordinary times to test the current effect of the rate prescribed and to indicate its probable effect in the near future. The times here involved were, however, in a high degree abnormal. It did not follow that, because the system had earned less than 8 per cent. in 1919 and in 1920, that it would earn less than 8 per cent. in 1921. A rate ordinance invalid when adopted may later become valid, just as an ordinance valid when made may become invalid by change in conditions. Municipal Gas Co. v. \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 401]\n\u00a0\n Commission, 225 N. Y. 89, 96, 121 N. E. 772. Compare Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134; Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co. ( decided March 6, 1922) \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264, 66 L. Ed. --.\n The District Judge was obliged to form an opinion as to the probable net earnings in the future. All relevant facts, except as stated, and all applicable arguments were fully and clearly presented by the parties and were carefully considered by the court. Although the District Judge treated the master's report as advisory merely, he passed upon the numerous exceptions taken to the master's findings in order to indicate his view on the precise points raised. He allowed some exceptions and disallowed others. Upon petition for rehearing further careful consideration was given to the case. Views expressed in the first opinion on some matters were modified; but these changes did not call for any change in the decree. The District Judge had before him some evidence not before the master; for the company's expert was recalled and testified both to the result of operations of later months in which there was a large increase in travel and to the heavy decline in prices which occurred after October. Concerning actual facts there was substantially no controversy. On the elements to be considered in determining whether the rate would be confiscatory no error was made which could substantially affect the result. His determination whether the prescribed rate would be confiscatory was necessarily based largely on a prophecy, for normal condition had not been restored. He found that gross revenues were steadily increasing; and that they were larger under the 5-cent fare than they had been during the preceding year when the 6-cent rate was in effect. He was convinced that operating costs would decrease largely during the year. His two opinions show that every element upon which his prophecy should be based received careful consideration. We cannot say that the evidence compelled a conviction that the rate would \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 402]\n\u00a0\n prove inadequate. Compare San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 754\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 804; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 U.S. 439\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 571; Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148.\n The occasion for the suit was solely the extraordinary rise in prices incident to the war. There was no suggestion that the action of the board evidenced hostility to the utility, or that the board was arbitrary or hasty. It had been theretofore considerate of the company's rights and needs. When prices rose rapidly in 1918, it raised the fare limit to 6 cents, although the franchise ordinance prescribed the 5-cent fare. And this was before our decision in San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service Co., \n255 U.S. 547\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 428. Its reduction of the fare by ordinance of June 5, 1919, was made after hearing, and was doubtless due to the conviction, shared by many, that, with the cessation of hostilities and the negotiation of the Peace Treaty, prices and operating cost would fall abruptly. This prophecy, if such there was, proved false. But nearly three years have elapsed since the board adopted the ordinance; and more than a year since entry of the decree below. We know judicially that the period has, in general, been one of continuous price recession, and that the current rates of return on capital are much lower than they then were. \n9\n But we cannot know to what extent the important changes occurring have affected either gross revenues or the net return. There is no reason to believe that the board would not give full and fair consideration to a proposed change in rate if application were now made to it. And the District Judge stated in his opinion (272 Fed. 147 ), that the decree to be entered would be vacated or amended in case it should later appear that the regulating board declined such adjustment of rates as the actual \n\n[258 U.S. 388, 403]\n\u00a0\n experience of the utility might show it entitled to; and the decree was thereupon entered without prejudice.\n The District Judge refused a temporary injunction and did not exact a bond. Hence the only relief we can grant is such as operates in futuro. Compare Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 464\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196. An injunction should not issue now, unless conditions are such that the prescribed rate is confiscatory. As by the reservation in the decree appellant may secure protection against the ordinance if under existing conditions the 5-cent rate appears to be inadequate, the decree should be affirmed. Compare Lincoln Gas & Electric Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454; Ex parte Lincoln Gas & Electric Co., \n256 U.S. 512\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 558; \n257 U.S. 6\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 2.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That is 'the estimated undepreciated cost of reproduction of railway property of the company on the historical basis, exclusive of franchise value, going concern value, bond discount and brokerage fee,' but with land and right of way which cost about $15,000 estimated at their present value of $58,836. It was also agreed, for the purpose of dividing joint items, that one-fifth of the property of the company was devoted to its light and power business. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Richberg, 31 Yale Law Journal, 263, 266, 279; Hale, 30 Yale Law Journal, 710, 720; Henderson, 33 Harvard Law Review, 902, 1031; Friday, 36 Quarterly Journal of Economics, 197, 211. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] He allowed also on account of federal income taxes a sum of $8,008 which the court disallowed. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] From the agreed valuation of $1,715,825, the court deducted $425, 117 for property not subject to this appreciation-land, already given its market value, and capital acquired recently (all acquisitions before January 1, 1915, being assumed to have been at the 1913 price level, all since that date at the new level). The balance was appreciated one-third; the $425,117 was added again; and accrued depreciation, likewise appreciated one-third, was subtracted. The court thus obtained a base value of $1,626,061. The master's figure was slightly smaller (but for his inclusion of development cost and brokerage) for he excepted more property from this 33 1\/3 per cent. appreciation. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Hill v. Antigo Water Co., 3 Wis. R. R. Com. Reports, 623, 705-723. But see Cunningham v. Chippewa Falls Water Co., 5 Wis. R. R. Com. Reports, 302, 315; Appleton v. Appleton Waterworks Co., 5 Wis. R. R. Com. Reports 215, 277; In re Purchase Racine Waterworks Plant, 19 Wis. R. R. Com. Reports, 83, 140. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] On the other hand, if what is to be considered in determining the net deficit is not the result of operations from the beginning of the enterprise, but the result of operations since the present owner acquired it-in other words, the return on its investment-we are left without the data necessary to determine the fact. For the record does not disclose what the present company paid when it purchased the property in 1905 as a going concern. For aught that appears, appellant has received full 8 per cent. annually on that amount and later additions to capital. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The record cost of the property was originally used as the base for this calculation. But the figure $67,076 was tacitly agreed by both parties to be the amount, if any, that should be allowed for brokerage. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It is difficult to see how, on the facts presented, so large a sum as $16,254 could have been paid on account of the year's operation. Indeed the court, in disallowing the item of federal income tax, deducted not $16, 254, but $8,008. Even this seems too large, for the net earnings, without deduction of the $16,254 attributed to income tax, for the year ending June 30, 1920, as found by the master, were $66,503.60. From this, interest paid or accrued on indebtedness is to be deducted before computing the net income on which the tax is payable. A large part of the capital of utility companies is ordinarily represented by interest-bearing bonds and notes; and there is evidence that such indebtedness of the appellant was 'in the neighborhood of $1,400,000.' The interest on this debt chargeable to the railway system would be at least $50,000. There is further an exemption from tax of $2,000 of the net income. So a 10 per cent. tax on the balance would amount to less than $1,500.\n In the record and briefs elsewhere the income tax is reckoned at between $8,000 and $10,000, which is a proper figure if there be an 8 per cent. return on $1,626,061. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Federal Reserve Bulletin, January, 1922, pp. 5, 79, 113; February 1922, pp. 156, 157. \n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGASTON WILLIAMS & WIGMORE OF CANADA v. WARNER(1922)\nNo. 59\nArgued: October 13, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Cletus Keating, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph P. Nolan, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[260 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The parties to this action on December 11, 1916, in New York City, entered into a contract, the essential terms of which appear in the following letter from petitioner to respondent:\n'Referring to our conversation this afternoon, I beg to advise that you are authorized to offer the steamer Eskasoni for sale for four hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, $475,000.\n\n'Details as to terms of payment, transfer of steamer, etc., can be talked over when you have purchasers.'\n\n Respondent was a citizen of the state of New York and a resident of New York City. Petitioner was a foreign corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the Dominion of Canada. The steamship referred to was a Britsh steamship of St. Johns, Newfoundland, owned by the petitioner. It was agreed that the respondent should receive 2 1\/2 per cent. commission for securing a purchaser for the ship. Respondent undertook the employment and subsequently introduced to petitioner two prospective purchasers, with whom petitioner entered into a written contract for the charter and sale of the ship for the sum mentioned. Five thousand dollars was paid down on account, out of which respondent received 2 1\/2 per cent., or $125.\n Subsequently it appeared that the petitioner was bound by a contract with the British government to comply with the instructions and rules of that government in the operation of its vessels, and whereby it agreed not to charter any vessel to any one to whom that government should object. Among the governmental regulations then in force was one which provided that:\n'A person shall not without permission in writing from the shipping comptroller directly or indirectly and \n\n[260 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n whether on his own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, purchase or enter into or offer to enter into any agreement or any negotiations with a view to an agreement for the purchase of any ship or vessel.'\n\n Any act in contravention of this regulation was declared to be an offense.\n Permission to make the sale in question was never obtained and the petitioner was notified by its consul that such permission would be withheld by the British government. The petitioner thereupon refused to consummate the sale and returned to the purchasers the $5,000 which they had paid.\n The respondent brought an action against petitioner in the District Court of the United States, Southern District of New York, to recover the balance of his commission, which resulted in a judgment in his favor. On error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, and the petitioner brings the case here on writ of certiorari.\n The District Court declined to charge, as requested by petitioner, that if the jury believed the evidence to the effect that the contract under British law was illegal and void, that this would constitute a good defense to the action. On the contrary, that court instructed the jury in effect that the invalidity of the contract under British law would constitute no defense to the action and directed a verdict for the respondent, which was returned in the sum of $11,750, and judgment was entered accordingly.\n The contract, as stated, was made in New York, and it does not appear that the contracting parties in making it had in view any other law than that of the place where it was made. It is therefore to be governed as to its validity and operation by the law of the state of New York. Bulkley v. Honold, 19 How. 390, 392; Scudder v. \n\n[260 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n Union National Bank, \n91 U.S. 406\n, 412. Tested by that law the contract is valid. By the terms of the contract respondent was 'authorized to offer the steamer Eskasoni for sale for $475,000.' Nothing was said as to where the ship then was, what flag she carried nor what law was to govern the transaction. The contract of charter and sale provided for the payment of the consideration in several installments in New York City and for the delivery of the ship to the purchasers at that port.\n When, in pursuance of this contract, respondent procured purchasers for the ship at the stated sum, with whom petitioner entered into contract, the transaction, so far as the respondent was concerned, was completed and he became entitled to the payment of the stipulated commission. The fact that the contract of charter and sale was subsequently canceled because petitioner was unable to secure the consent of the British government to the sale could have no effect upon the respondent's rights. The contract with respondent, as well as the contract of charter and sale, was made and was to be performed within the state of New York, and being valid under the law of that state, the respondent is not to be deprived of his compensation simply because petitioner found itself unable to consummate the latter contract by reason of its inability to perform a condition made necessary by the provisions of the law of another country. See Aber v. Pennsylvania Co., etc., 269 Pa. 384, 112 Atl. 444.\n Even if the contract of sale was void by British law, all other questions aside, respondent's connection with it was not such as to deprive him of his commission. His action was not to enforce that contract, but his own. Irwin v. Williar, \n110 \nU.S. 499, 509\n, 510 S., 4 Sup.

CO.(1922)\nNo. 34\nArgued: October 6, 1922Decided: November 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n This suit in equity was begun in the court of common pleas of Cuyahoga county, Ohio, to enjoin a proposed consolidation of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company, the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Company, and nine other companies, not identified in the bill, and to secure other relief of an incidental nature. The suit was brought by the General Investment Company, a Maine corporation, and the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company, the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Company, the Central Trust Company, and three individuals, called the 'Read committee,' were named as defendants.\n The principal ground on which the proposed consolidation was assailed was that it would contravene the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8820- 8823, 8827-8830) and the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730)-both laws of the United States. There were also charges that it would be contrary to the Constitution and laws of Ohio and other states, but the general tenor of the bill made it evident that these charges were to be taken as of secondary importance. The plaintiff's right to sue was based on allegations that it was a stockholder in the New York Central Company and the Lake Shore Company, and, as such, \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n would be subjected to irreparable loss and damage, should the consolidation be effected.\n Process was duly served on the Lake Shore Company and there was a purported service on the New York Central Company; but there was neither service on nor appearance by the other defendants. The New York Central Company, appearing specially for the purpose, promptly challenged the validity of the service on it by moving to set the same aside; but the state court overruled the motion.\n In due time the two railroad companies caused the suit to be removed into the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio. The plaintiff objected to this and reserved an exception to the order allowing it. The removal was sought and allowed on the ground that the suit, according to the claim made in the bill, was one arising under the laws of the United States, and of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction. Diversity of citizenship was shown, but not specified as a ground for removal.\n Shortly after the removal the New York Central Company, again appearing specially for the purpose, sought and obtained in the District Court another hearing on its objection to the purported service on it, and on that hearing the objection was sustained and the service set aside. 226 Fed. 976. Afterwards motions by the plaintiff to remand the suit to the state court, to direct special service on the New York Central Company and other defendants in the mode provided in section 57 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1039), and for leave to file a supplemental bill and make new parties defendant, were severally overruled. And lastly a motion by the Lake Shore Company, the only defendant then before the court, to dismiss the suit, was sustained on the ground that the New York Central Company was an indispensable party, had not voluntarily \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n appeared, and was not within the reach of the court's process.\n From the decree of dismissal the plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court upheld the rulings setting aside the service on the New York Central Company, denying the motion to remand to the state court, declining to direct special service on the New York Central Company and other defendants, and refusing leave to file a supplemental bill and make new parties. It also sustained the decree of dismissal as to much of the bill, with the qualification that it be without prejudice, and reversed it as to other parts of the bill to which that court thought the Lake Shore Company was the only necessary defendant. 250 Fed. 160, 162 C. C. A. 296.\n When the cause was returned to the District Court, the plaintiff, complying with a direction that the bill be made certain in a particular in which the Circuit Court of Appeals deemed it uncertain, so amended it as to show the date on which the directors of the Lake Shore and other companies adopted the agreement for the proposed consolidation. The Lake Shore Company then moved that the bill, as left by the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, be dismissed on the grounds: (a) That in so far as it was directed to securing an injunction against alleged or threatened violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, or the Clayton Act, the plaintiff had no right or standing to maintain it, or, if having such a right or standing, could not bring it in a state court, as was done; and ( b) that in so far as it was directed against alleged or threatened violations of state Constitutions or laws it did not show a right in equity to the relief sought or any part thereof. This motion was sustained and a decree of dismissal entered. The plaintiff again appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court affirmed the decree, but without prejudice to the institution in a proper court of a new suit, based only on infractions of state \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n Constitutions or laws. 269 Fed. 235. A further appeal brings the case here.\n Messrs. F. A. Henry, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Elijah N. Zoline, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. Walter C. Noyes, of New York City, and Samuel H. West, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Complaint is made of each of the rulings alluded to in the foregoing statement together with some others. We take them up in their order.\n The setting aside of the purported service on the New York Central Company.\n While the state court considered the objection to the service and overruled it before the removal, this was not an obstacle to an examination of the question by the District Court after the removal. The state court's ruling was purely interlocutory, and its status in this regard was not affected by the removal. Being interlocutory, it was subject to reconsideration, and would continue to be so up to the passing of a final decree. Had the cause remained in the state court, the power to reconsider would have been in that court, but when the removal was made the power passed with the cause to the District Court. Of course in the latter the ruling was to be treated with respect, but not as final or conclusive. Garden City Manufacturing Co. v. Smith, 9 Fed. Cas. p. 1153, No. 5,217; Bryant v. Thompson (C. C.) 27 Fed. 881. And see Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 \nU.S. 518, 522\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 559.\n The sheriff returned that he had served the summons on the New York Central Company in Cuyahoga county by delivering a copy to 'W. A. Barr, regular ticket agent, in charge of the business of said company.' As grounds \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n for assailing this service the company alleged that it was a New York corporation, had no railroad in Ohio, was not doing business there, did not maintain a place of business or office in that state, and had not made Barr its agent or employe. From the evidence adduced on that issue the District Court, as also the Circuit Court of Appeals, found that the grounds of the company's objection were all true in point of fact. We have examined the evidence and discover no occasion for disturbing the finding. Indeed, we think a different one would have been quite inadmissible. The substance of the evidence is accurately set forth in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (250 Fed. 165, 162 C. C. A. 296), and need not be repeated here.\n It follows that the purported service on this company was invalid and rightly set aside. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co. v. McKibbon, \n243 U.S. 264\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 280, and cases cited.\n Alleged submission by New York Central Company to court's jurisdiction.\n The plaintiff contends that, even if the service was not good, the company waived the fault and submitted to the court's jurisdiction. Three things are relied on as constituting or showing such a waiver and submission. They are the petition for removal, a stipulation bringing before the District Court evidence presented in the state court, and a brief filed in opposition to the motion to remand. We think the contention had no support in any of them.\n In fact, the petition for removal contained an express declaration that the company was 'not intending to waive any question of the sufficiency of service or the want of service,' but was 'reserving all questions of service, jurisdiction, and want of service.' Besides, it is well settled that a petition for removal, even if not containing such a reservation, does not amount to a general appearance, but only a special appearance, and that after the removal the party securing it has the same right to invoke the decision \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n of the United States court on the validity of the prior service that he has to ask its judgment on the merits. Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 \nU.S. 271, 279\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 126; Mechanical Appliance Co. v. Castleman, \n215 \nU.S. 437, 441\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 125; Cain v. Commercial Publishing Co., \n232 \nU.S. 124, 131\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 284. The plaintiff insists that, even if that be the usual rule, it is not applicable here, because by this petition the company sought and secured a removal into a District Court other than the one designated by law. But, as will be shown presently, the court to which removal was asked and effected was the proper one. So, whether the petition be judged by what it says or by its legal effect, it did not amount to a general appearance or a waiver of any invalidity in the service.\n The stipulation relied on was made between the plaintiff and the New York Central Company and related to the use of specific evidence bearing directly on the validity of the service on the latter. The evidence had been presented at the hearing in the state court on that question, and the purpose of the stipulation was merely to make it, or a report of it, available at a new hearing in the District Court on the same question. The stipulation did not in terms restrict the use to that hearing, but such a restriction inhered in the nature of the evidence specified, and was implied. In the application whereon the new hearing was granted the company had declared that it was appearing specially for the purpose only of questioning the validity of the service. That declaration, made at the outset, applied to and qualified every step taken by the company in bringing the question to a hearing and decision. Joining in the stipulation was merely such a step.\n After the service on the New York Central Company was held invalid and set aside, the plaintiff moved that the cause be remanded to the state court. At that time the Lake Shore Company was the only defendant before \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n the court. A brief by solicitors subscribing themselves as 'Solicitors for Defendants' was filed in opposition to the motion. The plaintiff insists this was a general appearance by the New York Central Company. In the body of the brief its authors referred to the absence of any process against or appearance by the Central Trust Company and the members of the Read committee, recited the proceedings and order whereby the service on the New York Central Company was set aside, said of that company that it 'is not now a defendant,' spoke of the Lake Shore Company as 'now the only real and actual defendant,' and otherwise indicated that in filing the brief they were acting for the Lake Shore Company, and for it alone. The plaintiff attaches much weight to the plural term 'defendants' in the subscription and gives little consideration to the prior proceedings and the plain purport of the body of the brief. We think all should be considered, and that, when this is done, it is apparent, as was said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the use of the plural term was an inadvertence; the singular being intended. Certainly the plural had no particular reference to the New York Central Company, and yet the plaintiff treats it as including that company, but not the Central Trust Company or the members of the Read committee. This serves to show the fallacy of the claim. If the term included any defendant not then before the court, it included all-one as much as another. But if it be reconciled, as we think it should be, with the prior situation and the general purport of the brief, it becomes evident that it referred, and was intended to refer, to the Lake Shore Company, the only defendant then in the suit, and to it alone.\n Refusal to remand to state court.\n A restatement of the facts bearing on the propriety of this ruling will be helpful. The suit, according to the plaintiff's statement of its case as made in the bill, was one \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 271]\n\u00a0\n arising under the laws of the United States, and this was so, although the claim to the relief sought was based in part on local Constitutions and laws. It also appeared that the matter in controversy exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000. Because the suit possessed these elements, it was removed from the common pleas court of Cuyahoga county, Ohio, where it had been brought and was pending, into the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio, which included Cuyahoga county. The removal, which was over the plaintiff's objection and exception, was had on the petition of two defendants, the only ones attempted to be brought before the state court. One of these, the New York Central Company, was a corporate citizen of New York, and therefore not an inhabitant of the Northern district of Ohio,1 while the other, the Lake Shore Company, was a corporate citizen of Ohio and an inhabitant of the Northern district of that state.\n The ground on which the plaintiff moved that the cause be remanded to the state court was that, as the New York Central Company, one of the defendants, was not an inhabitant of the Northern district of Ohio, the suit could not have been originally brought in the District Court for that district, and therefore could not be removed into it from the state court. The motion was denied.\n As we shall show, the argument advanced against that ruling confuses venue with general jurisdiction, and also confuses the venue prescribed for cases begun in the District Courts with that prescribed for cases removed into them from state courts.\n Section 24, subd. 1, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991) declares that--\n'The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction ... of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 272]\n\u00a0\n equity, ... where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of three thousand dollars, and ( a) arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or (b) is between citizens of different states. ...'\n\n This provision covers two distinct classes of suits. In one the distinctive feature consists in the fact that the suit arises under the Constitution, or a law or treaty, of the United States, the citizenship of the parties not being an element; while in the other the distinctive feature consists in the fact that the parties are citizens of different states, the particular basis or ground of the suit not being an element. This suit was within the first class, and, the requisite amount being involved, it came within the general jurisdiction of the District Courts as defined by section 24\n Section 51 (Comp. St.  1033) deals with the venue of suits begun in those courts and provides, subject to exceptions not material here, that--\n'... No civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n\n This restriction, as repeatedly has been held, does not affect the general jurisdiction of a District Court over a particular cause, but merely establishes a personal privilege of the defendant, which he may insist on, or may waive, at his election, and does waive, where suit is brought in a district other than the one specified, if he enters an appearance without claiming his privilege. Central Trust Co. v. McGeorge, \n151 U.S. 129\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 286; Interior Construction, & Impro. Co. v. Gibney, \n160 U.S. 217\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 272; In re Moore, \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 273]\n\u00a0\n \n209 \nU.S. 490, 501\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 706, 14 Ann. Cas. 1164; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 478.\n It therefore cannot be affirmed broadly that this suit could not have been brought against the New York Central Company in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, but only that it could not have been brought and maintained in that court over a seasonable objection by the company to being sued there. And the inability of the court to proceed with the cause in the presence of such an objection would not have resulted from any want of power to entertain and determine such a suit between such parties, if they were before it, but only because the company declined to yield the necessary jurisdiction of its person. Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 501, 503\n, 508 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 184.\n Respecting the jurisdiction of the district courts on removal from state courts, section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1010) declares:\n'Any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction by this title, which may now be pending or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed by the defendant or defendants therein to the District Court of the United States for the proper district. Any other suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, of which the District Courts of the United States are given jurisdiction by this title, and which are now pending or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed into the District Court of the United States for the proper district by the defendant or defendants therein, being nonresidents of that state. ...'\n\n The next section (29 Comp. St.  1011) provides that the removal shall be 'into the District Court to be held in the district where \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 274]\n\u00a0\n such suit is pending,' and section 53 (Comp. St.  1035) provides that, where the district is separated into distinct divisions, the removal shall be into the District Court 'in the division in which the county is situated from which the removal is made.'\n Shortly after the original enactment of the removal provisions now embodied in sections 28 and 29 the meaning of the words 'the proper district,' found in section 28, was drawn in question, and the courts, on examining the entire statute, very generally reached the conclusion that the words mean the district which includes the county or place where the suit is pending at the time of the removal. Subject to exceptional departures soon disapproved, that view has prevailed ever since,2 and we regard it as obviously right.\n From what has been said it seems plainly to follow that this suit was removable and that the removal was to the District Court for the proper district. But the plaintiff insists that this view does not give due effect to the clause in section 28, 'of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction,' and the provision in section 51 respecting the place of suit or venue. These, it is argued, show that removability is not to be determined by inquiring merely whether the particular suit is one of which section 24 says the District Courts 'shall have original jurisdiction,' but by inquiring also whether it is one which under section 51 could be brought, over the defendant's objection, in the District Court for the particular district within which \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 275]\n\u00a0\n it is pending in a state court. The argument means, and counsel for plaintiff so claim, that a suit arising under the Constitution, or a law or treaty, of the United States and brought in a state court within a particular federal district is removable if the defendant be an inhabitant of that district, but not if he be an inhabitant of some district in another state-in other words, that in respect of the right to remove such a suit the statute discriminates against defendants who are inhabitants of other states and in favor of those who are inhabitants of the state and district where the suit is pending. We think the contention runs counter to both the letter and spirit of the statute.\n Section 24 contains a typical grant of original jurisdiction to the District Courts in general of 'all suits' in the classes falling within its descriptive terms, save certain suits by assignees of particular choses in action. Section 51 does not withdraw any suit from that grant, but merely regulates the place of suit, its purpose being to save defendants from inconveniences to which they might be subjected if they could be compelled to answer in any district, or wherever found. Like similar state statutes, it accords to defendants a privilege which they may, and not infrequently do, waive.\n Coming to the removal section (28), it is apparent that the clause, 'of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction,' refers to the jurisdiction conferred on the District Courts in general, for it speaks of them in the plural. That it does not refer to the venue provision in section 51 is apparent, first, because that provision does not except or take any suit from the general jurisdiction conferred by section 24; next, because there could be no purpose in extending to removals the personal privilege accorded to defendants by section 51, since removals are had only at the instance of defendants; and, lastly, \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 276]\n\u00a0\n because the venue on removal is specially dealt with and fixed by section 29.\n There are still other reasons for thinking the venue provision of section 51 has no bearing on removals. First, its own words confine it to suits begun in the District Courts; and, next, it cannot be regarded as limiting the right of removal without disregarding the plain import of section 28. That section provides for the removal of suits falling within any one of several classes and declares who shall have the right to remove them. As to the first class, which comprises suits arising under the Constitution, or a law or treaty, of the United States, the right is given to the defendant or defendants without any qualification, while as to the other classes the right is given to the defendant or defendants if he or they be nonresidents of the state. Evidently the question of what, if any, limitation in that regard should be attached to the right was considered when the section was in process of enactment and was dealt with therein to the extent that Congress deemed a limitation advisable. Of course, the omission of such a limitation as to suits of the first class, when contrasted with the express imposition of one as to suits of the other classes, means that Congress intended there should be none as to the former.\n Prior to the adoption of the Judicial Code, with its present arrangement of sections, the jurisdictional provisions of section 24 and the venue provision of section 51 constituted the first section of the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 443, the jurisdictional provisions preceding the other. The removal provision of section 28, with the clause, 'of which the Circuit Courts3 of the United States are given original jurisdiction,' constituted the second section of the same \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 277]\n\u00a0\n act. Speaking of that act, and particularly of the meaning of the clause just quoted, this court on different occasions said the clause referred 'to the first part of section 1 by which jurisdiction is conferred, and not to the clause relating to the district in which suit may be brought,' and that 'the clause vesting jurisdiction should not be confounded with the clause determining the particular courts in which the jurisdiction must be exercised.' Mexican National R. Co. v. Davidson, \n157 \nU.S. 201, 208\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 563, 566 (39 L. Ed. 672); Sweeney v. Carter Oil Co., \n199 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 55, 58 (50 L. Ed. 178). There were also many decisions to the same effect in the Circuit Courts. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n True, that view was departed from in the case of Ex parte Wisner, \n203 U.S. 449\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 150, where the provision Ct. 150, where the provision relating to the district in which suit may be brought was treated as strictly jurisicational, not avoidable even by the consent of both parties, and applicable to removals. But much that was said in that of In re Moore, \n209 \nU.S. 490, 501\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 585, 588 (52 L. Ed. 904, 14 Ann. Cas. 1164), where the court returned to its former view, saying:\n'The contention is that as this action could not have been originally brought in the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri by reason of the last provision quoted from section 1, it cannot under section 2 be removed to that court, as the authorized removal is only of those cases of which by the prior section original jurisdiction is given to the United States Circuit Courts. But this ignores the distinction between the general description of the jurisdiction of the United States courts and the clause naming \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 278]\n\u00a0\n the particular district in which an action must be brought.'\n\n That no change in the meaning of the act of 1888 was intended or wrought by the mere rearrangement of its sections or parts as incorporated into the Judicial Code is shown by sections 294 and 295 of the Code (Comp. St.  1271, 1272). See Brown v. Fletcher, \n235 \nU.S. 589, 597\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 154; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 331\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 380; J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458, 463\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 158.\n The plaintiff cites the cases of Tennessee v. Bank of Commerce, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 654, Cochran v. Montgomery County, \n199 U.S. 260\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 58, 4 Ann. Cas. 451, and In re Winn, \n213 U.S. 458\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 515, as holding that, to be removable into a particular federal court, a suit must be one which as of right could have been brought originally in that court. But those cases are not fairly susceptible of that interpretation. In each a right of removal was claimed and was denied. In the first and third the right was claimed on the ground that the suit was one arising under the laws of the United States, and the denial was put on the ground that the plaintiff's statement of his cause of action, apart from any anticipation of defenses, did not show that it arose under those laws. Because of this, it was said in both cases that the suit could not have been brought originally in the Circuit Court, and therefore could not be removed into it. In the second case the right was claimed on the ground of diversity of citizenship coupled with prejudice and local influence, and the denial was put on the ground that the requisite diversity of citizenship did not exist; the plaintiff and one of the defendants being citizens of the same state. Thus the turning point in each case was that the suit was not one of which the Circuit Courts were given original jurisdiction-in other words, that it could not have been brought in any of them, and not that there was any special obstacle to the exercise of jurisdiction by the particular one to which removal was sought. The opinions \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 279]\n\u00a0\n in the cases show that the real holding was that the suit was not removable, because not within the original jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Courts in general. Indeed, in the second case it was said to be the established rule that 'those suits only can be removed of which the Circuit Courts are given original jurisdiction,' and the first case was cited as so holding. \n199 U.S. 269\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 61, 4 Ann. Cas. 451.\n We conclude that, as the present suit was one arising under the laws of the United States, of which the District Courts are given original jurisdiction by section 24, the defendants were entitled under sections 28 and 29 to remove it from the state court where it was begun into the District Court for that district, regardless of their citizenship or places of inhabitance, and therefore that the motion to remand was rightly denied.\n In presenting this question counsel have treated section 51 of the Judicial Code as regulating the district in which suits under the anti- trust laws may be brought, and our discussion of the question has proceeded on that line. To avoid any misapprehension it should be observed that section 12 of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 736 [Comp. St.  8835k]) alters that venue provision in respect of such suits, but not in a way which is material here. Like section 51, the special provision in section 12 does not affect the general jurisdiction of the District Courts, but merely establishes a personal privilege which a defendant is free to waive.\n Refusal to direct special service under section 57 of the Judicial Code on New York Central Company and other defendants.\n This section is in terms restricted to suits 'to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon or claim to, or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to, real or personal property' located within the district of suit or partly within that district and partly within another district 'within the same state.' As to such a suit it provides that where a defendant is not an inhabitant of \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 280]\n\u00a0\n the district, nor found within the same, and does not voluntarily appear, the court may make an order directing such defendant to appear and plead by a day certain, to be fixed in the order; that personal service of the order, if practicable, shall be made on such defendant wherever found, and, if that mode of service be not practicable, service may be had by publication; that the order shall also be served on the person in possession or charge of the property, if any there be; and that after the order has been properly served the court may proceed with the cause, but with the qualification that as against any such defendant not appearing the adjudication shall affect only the property which shall have been the subject of the suit and so located as to be under the court's jurisdiction therein.\n It has been doubted that this section applies to suits begun in state courts and removed into federal courts;5 but this question was not noticed in argument, and we find its decision is not essential here.\n Obviously the section is confined to suits which are local in the sense of relating directly to specific property, real or personal, within the district of suit or partly therein and partly in another district of the same state. This suit was not within that category. It was not brought to enforce a claim to or lien upon specific property so located, nor to cancel an incumbrance or lien thereon nor to remove a cloud upon the title. On the contrary, as the original bill plainly disclosed, it was brought to enjoin two railroad companies-one having lines both within and without the state in which the suit was begun, and the other having lines without that state-from consolidating, along with nine other companies, into a single corporation. Such a suit is essentially in personam and strictly transitory, and is not made \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 281]\n\u00a0\n any the less so by including in the bill, as was done here, an incidental prayer that the consolidation be annulled if consummated pending the suit. So, tested by the original bill, this suit was not one wherein special service could be had under section 57.\n Denial of leave to file supplemental bill and make new parties.\n The original bill showed that the plaintiff was suing in its own right as a stockholder in the New York Central and the Lake Shore Companies to prevent loss and damage which it apprehended would come to it as such stockholder if the consolidation were effected. By the supplemental bill, proffered for filing eight months after the suit was begun, the plaintiff sought, first, to show that in the meantime the consolidation had been effected, that the properties of the consolidating companies had been turned over to the consolidated company, and that two mortgages had been executed and delivered by the latter covering all the property received from the Lake Shore Company; secondly, to change the character and object of the suit in such way that the plaintiff would be suing in the right and on behalf of the Lake Shore Company, of which it was a stockholder, with the purpose (a) of having so much of that company's property as was within that district freed from the claim of the consolidated company, (b) of enforcing a restoration of that part of the property to the Lake Shore Company, and (c) of having the two mortgages executed by the consolidated company pronounced void and of no effect as to that part of the property; and, thirdly, to bring in various new parties as defendants.\n An application for leave to file a supplemental bill is addressed to the discretion of the court, and the ruling thereon will not be disturbed on appeal unless the discretion has been abused. Under equity rule 34 (33 Sup. Ct. xxviii) the office of a supplemental bill is to introduce matters occurring \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 282]\n\u00a0\n after the filing of the original bill, or not then known to the plaintiff. Much more was attempted by the supplemental bill tendered in this instance. By it, as we have shown, the plaintiff sought to shift the right in which it was suing and to change the character and object of the suit. Other matters also had a bearing on the propriety of granting leave to file it. The railroad of the Lake Shore Company extended from Buffalo, N. Y., to Chicago, Ill. Its maintenance and operation as a through line was a matter of general concern. To dismember it might work a serious disturbance of both public and private interests. If its inclusion in the consolidation was unlawful, it was so in respect of the entire line. The supplemental bill sought to deal with only a minor part, and, if sustained, would result in restoring that part to the Lake Shore Company, while leaving the major part with the consolidated company. At a meeting of the stockholders of the Lake Shore Company, at which 459,461 shares were represented, the holders of 459,379 shares had voted to ratify the consolidation. The plaintiff held but 5 shares, and had purchased these knowing that the directors had signed the agreement for the consolidation two months before. The ownership of these shares was put forward as entitling the plaintiff to proceed in the right of the Lake Shore Company. No other shareholder was seeking to join in the proceeding. Under the terms of the consolidation the plaintiff could surrender its shares and take five times their par value in stock of the consolidated company, or under a supplemental arrangement it could surrender its shares and receive five times their par value in cash-a sum not alleged to be less than the actual or market value. The shareholders represented by the Read committee availed themselves of the latter alternative. The Circuit Court of Appeals, considering all these matters, concluded that the action of the District Court in refusing leave to file the supplemental bill was \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 283]\n\u00a0\n within the limits of a reasonable discretion and should not be disturbed. We concur in that conclusion.\n Dismissal of original bill on motions of Lake Shore Company.\n In so far as the allegations of fact in the bill need be noticed here they may be summarized as follows: The railroad of the New York Central Company extended from New York City to Buffalo, and there connected with the Lake Shore Company's line from Buffalo to Chicago. Continuously since 1898 the New York Central Company had owned more than a majority of the stock of the Lake Shore Company and the Michigan Central Company. For several years the Lake Shore Company had been, and it still was, the owner of more than a majority of the stock of the Nickel Plate, the Big Four, the Lake Erie, and the Ohio Central Companies. The railroad of the Michigan Central Company and those of the several companies, a majority of whose stock was owned by the Lake Shore Company, were all parallel to and potential competitors of some part or all of the Lake Shore Company's line. All of the lines named were engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. The New York Central Company's interest in and control over the Lake Shore and the Michigan Central Companies had been acquired and was held with a view to suppressing competition in intrastate and interstate transportation and to restraining such commerce. In furtherance of that purpose the directors of the New York Central, the Lake Shore, and nine other companies (the nine were not named in the bill) recently had formulated and signed an agreement for the consolidation of the eleven companies into a single corporation. The agreement called for a ratification by stockholders' meetings. It was ratified over the plaintiff's protest at a meeting of the stockholders of the New York Central Company. The stockholders of the Lake Shore Company were intending to act on it at a meeting called \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 284]\n\u00a0\n for an early day, and would ratify it over the plaintiff's opposition, unless prevented from doing so by an injunction. Out of 2,555,810 outstanding shares in the New York Central Company the plaintiff was the owner of 300, which it had purchased two months before the agreement for the consolidation was signed by the directors, and out of 499,961 outstanding shares in the Lake Shore Company the plaintiff was the owner of 5, which it had purchased two months after the directors signed the agreement.\n The bill prayed that the New York Central Company be enjoined from voting its shares in the Lake Shore Company in favor of the consolidation agreement, or in any other way, or for any other purpose, that the Lake Shore Company be enjoined from permitting the New York Central Company to vote its shares in the former at any meeting of the stockholders, and that the Lake Shore Company be also enjoined from in any way entering into or consummating the proposed consolidation. Other incidental relief was prayed, but it need not be noticed here.\n Two motions to dismiss were interposed by the Lake Shore Company and sustained by the District Court-one before and the other after the first appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. On that appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling on the first motion as to part of the bill and reversed it as to the remainder. The second motion was directed against all that remainded of the bill and advanced objections thereto which might have been, but were not, urged or considered on the first appeal. The District Court, regarding these as well taken, sustained the second motion, and on the next appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals approved that ruling. These motions gave rise to several distinct questions which we shall take up separately.\n Effect of decision on first appeal.\n The plaintiff takes the position that the partial reversal on the first appeal amounted to an adjudication of the \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 285]\n\u00a0\n sufficiency of so much of the bill as fell within the reversal and that the District Court could not thereafter treat its sufficiency as an open question. This position is not tenable. The reversal was put on the ground that the District Court had erred in holding in respect of that part of the bill that the New York Central Company was an indispensable party. Whether that part was rightly subject to other objections, such as afterwards were advanced in the second motion to dismiss, was neither discussed nor decided on that appeal. The opinions delivered on the two appeals make this plain. In that situation it was quite admissible for the District Court, after the case was returned to it, to examine and pass on the objections presented in the second motion, and was likewise admissible for the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider them on the second appeal.

Ct. 739\n\n\n Was the New York Central Company an indispensable party?\n As to so much of the bill as sought to enjoin the New York Central Company from voting its shares in the Lake Shore Company, and to enjoin the latter from permitting it to vote them, we think it is obvious that the New York Central Company was an indispensable party, and that, with it neither appearing nor reached by any effective process, no other course was open than to dismiss that part of the bill. Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 \nU.S. 199, 235\n, 246 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 308; Talbot J. Taylor & Co. v. Southern Pacific Co. (C. C.) 122 Fed. 147, 152, 154.\n As to so much of the bill as sought to enjoin the Lake Shore Company from entering or consummating the proposed consolidation, the New York Central Company plainly was not an indispensable party. Its stockholding interest in the Lake Shore Company did not make its presence essential; its status in this regard being merely \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 286]\n\u00a0\n that of the stockholders in general. Nor did its participation in the agreement for the consolidation give it any right which required that it be brought in. At best the agreement was not to be effective uniess and until ratified by the stockholders of the several companies. It had not been ratified by the stockholders of the Lake Shore Company and they were under no obligation to ratify it.\n Was plaintiff entitled to sue under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act, and, if so, could that right be exercised through a suit brought in a state court?\n In the part of the bill assailed in the second motion to dismiss, as in the bill as a whole, the plaintiff based its right to relief by injunction primarily on the ground that the proposed consolidation would contravene the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (26 Stat. 209, c. 647), and the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730, c. 323), and secondarily on the ground that it would be contrary to the Constitution and laws of Ohio and other states.\n As respects the Sherman Anti-Trust Act as it stood before it was supplemented by the Clayton Act, this court has heretofore determined that the civil remedies specially provided in the act for actual and threatened violations of its provisions were intended to be exclusive and that those remedies consisted only of (a) suits for injunctions brought by the United States in the public interest under section 4 (Comp. St.  8823); and (b) private actions to recover damages brought under section 7 (Comp. St.  8829). Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n194 \nU.S. 48, 71\n, 24 S. Sup. St. 598; Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn Products Refining Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 398, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 118; Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 718; Geddes v. Anaconda Mining Co., \n254 \nU.S. 590, 593\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 209. The present suit for an injunction, brought by a private corporation in its own interest, was not within those remedies, and so could not be maintained under that act standing alone. \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 287]\n\u00a0\n That act was supplemented by the Clayton Act, particularly by its sixteenth section (Comp. St.  8835o) reading as follows:\n'That any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the anti-trust laws, including sections two, three, seven and eight of this act, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damages is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to entitle any person, firm, corporation, or association, except the United States, to bring suit in equity for injunctive relief against any common carrier subject to the provisions of the act to regulate commerce, approved February fourth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, in respect of any matter subject to the regulation, supervision, or other jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n This section undoubtedly enlarges the remedies provided in the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to the extent of enabling persons and corporations threatened with loss or damage through violations of that act to maintain suits to enjoin such violations, save in the instances specified in the proviso. This right to sue, however, is granted in terms which show that it is to be exercised only in a 'court of the United States.' This suit was brought in a state court, and in so far as its purpose was to enjoin a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act that court could not entertain it. The situation was the same in respect of the purpose to enjoin a violation of the Clayton Act. \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 288]\n\u00a0\n When a cause is removed from a state court into a federal court, the latter takes it as it stood in the former. A want of jurisdiction in the state court is not cured by the removal, but may be asserted after it is consummated. Cain v. Commercial Publishing Co., \n232 \nU.S. 124, 131\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 284 et seq.; Cowley v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n159 \nU.S. 569, 583\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 127; De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 174\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 743; Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n258 U.S. 377\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 349 (April 10, 1922).\n It follows that so much of the bill as based the right to relief on asserted violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act was rightly dismissed; but the dismissal, being for want of jurisdiction, should have been without prejudice.\n Did the bill show a right to relief in equity because of infractions of state Constitutions and laws?\n This branch of the suit was loosely set forth, and, as was observed by both courts below, there is some ground for thinking the references to state Constitutions and laws were merely makeweights. With other matters eliminated, this branch at best was left in a state of relative uncertainty. After commenting on this, the Circuit Court of Appeals said, with ample warrant (269 Fed. 239):\n'We next observe that the consolidation sought to be enjoined was only a new formulation of the situation which had been existing for many years. It is expressly averred that the obnoxious control of parallel and competing lines had been accomplished, and for many years maintained, by stock ownership and control. It does not seem to be claimed that the proposed consolidation would create any restraints on competition that did not already exist. We find no definite statement that what was proposed would be obnoxious to any statute or constitutional provision which did not relate to competition between parallel lines, excepting the claim that the proposed consolidation would increase the capital stock and debts above \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 289]\n\u00a0\n the permitted limit. It is probable, also, from the silence of the bill, that during all these years the public authorities of the various states have rested content and have not indicated any belief that public policy was being violated, and it may likewise seemingly be inferred that no public authorities are now objecting to the proposed consolidation, but that, on the contrary, they are all content.\n\n'Further, we notice that plaintiff owns only one one-thousandth of 1 per cent. of the capital stock, that no other shareholder has accepted its invitation to join in preventing the imminent irreparable injury, and that this interest plaintiff bought after the consolidation contract was made. He seems to be a volunteer, rather than a conscript. We have, then, a case where a private suitor, with a minimum of ponderable interest, and with no disposition to beware of entrance to a quarrel, is seeking relief upon the sole ground that the public policy of the state is being violated, and where the state authorities have long acquiesced and do acquiesce in any violation there may be. Under such circumstances, the court of equity will be strict in requiring the plaintiff to point out with precision and certainty in what respects the law is about to be violated and to show, clearly and positively, substantial and irreparable injury to its private rights. A measure of imperfection in pleading that might well be overlooked in the ordinary controversy should not be disregarded in such a case as this.'\n\n We think this branch of the suit should be tested by the rule of pleading there suggested, and that when this is done it is apparent that a right to equitable relief was not shown.\n Our conclusion is that the motions to dismiss were rightly sustained. The Circuit Court of Appeals qualified the dismissal by making it without prejudice as to all parts of the bill save one. We have indicated that the qualification should have included that part. \n\n[260 U.S. 261, 290]\n\u00a0\n The decree is accordingly modified, by making the dismissal without prejudice as to all parts of the bill, and, as thus modified, it is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Shaw v.

King, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for the State of Oklahoma.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 164, Oklahoma Laws of 1915, makes every person of the State liable to a tax upon his entire net income arising from all sources, except such as is exempt from taxation by some law of the United States or of the State. Under that statute Oklahoma seeks in these proceedings to hold the defendant, the plaintiff in error, liable for taxes for the years 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918, upon net income derived by him as lessee from leases of restricted Indian (Creek and Osage) lands, the leases being of the kind dealt with in Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 U.S. 292\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 27, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. V. Oklahoma, \n240 U.S. 522\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 453. The \n\n[257 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n facts were set forth by the defendant in special returns for the years mentioned, claiming exemption under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The auditor of the State accepted the returns as true but held that the defendant was liable to taxes on the income derived by him from sales of his share of oil and gas received under his leases. It is agreed that the lessee was an instrumentality used by the United States in carrying out duties to the Indians that it had assumed, and that the only question in the case is whether he is liable to this kind of tax. The District Court of the State held the tax void and on appeal by the State the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, but upon rehearing changed its mind and ordered the judgment reversed.\n In Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 U.S. 292\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 27, it was held that such a lessee could not be taxed on the gross sales of coals from Choctaw and Chickasaw mines, when the tax was in addition to the taxes collected upon an ad valorem basis. In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 U.S. 522\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 453, it was held that a similar lessee could not be taxed upon the value of an Osage oil lease. Subsequently the principle was applied per curiam to gross production taxes under a later statute of 1916, without reference to the fact that the taxes, instead of being in addition to, were in lieu of all taxes upon property rights. Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., \n247 U.S. 503\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 426; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, \n248 U.S. 549\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 183.\n The argument for the State is based primarily upon the cases sustaining taxes upon net income that include gains from interstate commerce, Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 U.S. 321\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; when 'all expenses are paid and losses adjusted, and after the recipient of the income is free to use it as he chooses.' William E. Peck & Co., Inc., v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 175\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 432, 434 (62 L. Ed. 1049). It is said also that tangible property within the State is subject to taxation and that therefore the defendant's \n\n[257 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n share of oil and gas cannot escape. If the cases that we have mentioned as decided per curiam tend to oppose the State's position, on the ground that if the property is exempt the income from it also is exempt, it is urged that so far as appears the distinction between the statute of 1916 then before the Court and the statutes dealt with by the authorities cited in those cases was overlooked.\n We cannot assume that there was the oversight supposed. The decision in \n240 U.S. 522\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 453 that such leases were not taxable went on general principles not on the nature of the particular statute, and in Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 48\n, 57 S., 58, 40 Sup. Ct. 221, a case that adverted to the distinction relied upon, the decisions per curiam were referred to as decided upon the merits. Those decisions appear to us to have been correct. The criterion of interference by the States with interstate commerce is one of degree. It is well understood that a certain amount of reaction upon and interference with such commerce cannot be avoided if the States are to exist and make laws. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 418; Diamond Glue Co. v. United States Glue Co., \n187 \nU.S. 611, 616\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 206. The rule as to instrumentalities of the United States on the other hand is absolute in form and at least stricter in substance. Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 416\n, 417 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 116, 419. Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 16. 'A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them.' \n240 U.S. 530\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 456. The step from this to the invalidity of the tax upon income from the leases is not long.\n In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from such a source the tax is pro tanto void, Pollock v. Farmer's Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 U.S. 601\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 912; a rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore, \n253 U.S. 245\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 550, 11 A. L. R. 519; and applied \n\n[257 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n in a case somewhat like the present by the Supreme Court of Hawaii, Oahu Ry. & Land Co. v. Pratt, 14 Hawaii, 126. Whether this property could be taxed in any other form or not, it cannot be reached as profits or income from leases such as those before us. The same considerations that invalidate a tax upon the leases invalidate a tax upon the profits of the leases, and, stopping short of theoretical possibilities, a tax upon such profits is a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards. Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468. The taxation of cattle grazing in Indian lands held valid in Thomas v. Guy, \n169 \nU.S. 264, 273\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 340, obviously is more remote. As a writ of error lies in this case the petition for certiorari that was presented for greater caution will be denied. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v.

Smith, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action for personal injuries caused by a collision on the defendant's road. The plaintiff, the petitioner, shipped some cattle from Bancroft in Idaho to Omaha in Nebraska and got a drover's pass to go with them as caretaker, free from charge other than that made for carrying the cattle. In consideration of the pass the plaintiff agreed that the carrier should not be liable for any injury to him upon the trip unless he or his personal representative should within thirty days after the injury give notice in writing of his claim to the general manager of the carrier on which line the accident occurred. This agreement was required in pursuance of a regulation that was part of the defendant's tariff duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The collision happened on November 24, 1917, and the plaintiff was in a hospital for about thirty days under the care of a doctor employed by the defendant, but was not disabled from giving the notice. He failed to give it, however. The District Court directed a nonsuit and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 264 Fed. 664. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n254 U.S. 623\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 8. \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n The only question is whether the requirement of notice in writing was valid. The railroad company does not contend that it could have exonerated itself altogether from liability for negligence (Norfolk Southern R. R. Co. v. Chatman, \n244 U.S. 276\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 499, L. R. A. 1917F, 1128) but argues that a stipulation for written notice within a reasonable time stands on a different footing, and of this there is no doubt. Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n248 \nU.S. 446, 449\n, 450 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 139; St. Louis Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Starbird, \n243 \nU.S. 592, 602\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 462, et seq. We perceive nothing in the form of the notice required to invalidate the requirement. It would have been sufficiently complied with if addressed to the railroad company, or to the General Manager, care of the railroad company. Of course too, actual knowledge on the part of employees of the company was not an excuse for omitting the notice in writing. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Starbird, \n243 U.S. 592\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 462. The doubt that led to the granting of the writ of certiorari was whether the prohibition of a requirement fixing less than ninety days for giving notice of claims in respect of goods established a public policy that would affect the present case. Act of March 4, 1915, c. 176,  1, 38 Stat. 1196 (Comp. St.  8604a). For although courts sometimes have been slow to extend the effect of statutes modifying the common law beyond the direct operation of the words, it is obvious that a statute may indicate a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind. Johnson v. United States, 163 Fed. 30, 32, 89 C. C. A. 508, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1194\n\n\n We are satisfied, however, that in this case the requirement was valid and that the statute referred to should not affect what in our opinion would be the law apart from it. The decisions that we have cited show that the time would have been sufficient, but for the statute, in respect of damage to goods, and the reasons are stronger to uphold it as adequate for personal injuries. A record \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n is kept of goods, yet even as to them reasonably prompt notice is necessary as a check upon fraud. There is no record of passengers, and the practice of fraud is too common to be ignored. Less time reasonably may be allowed for a notice of claims for personal injuries than is deemed proper for goods although very probably an exception might be implied if the accident made notice within the time impracticable. The statut cannot be taken to indicate a different view. On the contrary it is impossible to suppose that Congress when it was dealing with notices of claims, and even with the claims of passengers for baggage, Act of August 9 1916, c. 301, 39 Stat, 441, 442 (Comp. St.  8604a), should not have thought of their claims for personal injuries, and as it passed them by, we must suppose that it was satisfied to leave them to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the common law. See Galveston Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Woodbury, \n254 \nU.S. 357, 359\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 114; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Maucher, \n248 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 108. The fact that the form prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1921 is silent upon the subject cannot affect the result.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY was absent and took no part in the decision.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n On November 24, 1917, petitioner, Gooch, when a passenger in the caboose attached to the train in which respondent company was carrying a carload of cattle for him, was seriously injured by a collision with another train. Gooch was traveling on what has long been known as a 'drover's pass,' which it is admitted in the answer, as it must be ( Norfolk & Southern Railroad Co. v. Chatman, \n244 U.S. 276\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 499, L. R. A. 1917F, 1128), entitled him to the rights and protection \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n of a passenger for hire. It is also either admitted, or not denied, that Gooch was so injured that in about an hour and a half after he was hurt agents of the company took him to a hospital about 40 miles from the scene of the accident, where he was under the care of a physician employed by respondent for about 30 days, until he left the hospital, but he returned for two treatments by the company physician and was finally discharged by him on January 15, 1918 (52 days after the accident). Five days after Gooch entered the hospital, and while he was still in bed under the care of the company's physician, the claim adjuster of the company called upon him and asked him 'if he was ready for a settlement.' To this Gooch replied that 'he was not in a condition to talk with him; that he was not ready for a settlement.' About 10 days later, the claim agent called on him again at the hospital and found him sitting up in a wheeled chair and a conversation 'similar to the first one was held.' But his case was dismissed below and that judgment is affirmed by this court because be did not notify the company in writing within 30 days of the accident that he would claim damages for his injuries thus negligently caused.\n The company alleged in its answer, and it is not denied, that pursuant to the provisions of an effective tariff, when he delivered his cattle for transportation, Gooch signed a written stipulation that no claim for personal injury caused by its negligence should be valid or enforceable against the company unless notice in writing was given to the general manager thereof within 30 days after injury occurred.\n It was admitted that the petitioner did not give the required notice in writing and the judgment of this court is that the rule requiring it was a valid and reasonable rule and that it must be enforced by affirmance of the judgment of the court below, notwithstanding the intimate knowledge which the company so certainly had of Gooch's \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n injuries from an hour and a half after the accident, when it sent him to a hospital.\n From this conclusion of the court I dissent: (1) Because such a rule, as to property claims, has twice within 6 years been specifically declared by acts of Congress to be contrary to a public policy which I think it is the duty of this court to recognize and accept with respect to injuries to passengers; and (2) because in practice the rule is gravely unjust and discriminatory and therefore unreasonable.\n Of these in the order stated.\n First. The petitioner claims the rule is unreasonable and void under Boston & Maine Railroad v. Piper, \n246 U.S. 439\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 354, Ann. Cas. 1918E. 469, but the court holds it reasonable on two grounds: (1) Because the decisions of this court show that the time for notice was sufficient; and (2) because it is necessary to protect carriers from fraudulent claims.\n It is true that like, and even shorter, limitations with respect to claims for property were sustained under special circumstances in the two cases cited in the opinion of the court and in several others, but those cases arose before the Cummins Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act ( 38 Stat. 1196), which after providing for the issuing of a receipt or bill of lading for property received for transportation by a carrier, contains this provision:\n'Provided further, that it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days and for filing of claims for a shorter period than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit it by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.' \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n The first proviso thus quoted was a second time re-enacted, in terms ( with an addition with respect to computations of time named therein), in the carefully considered Transportation Act, approved February 28, 1920 ( 41 Stat. 456, 494), and the second proviso was left unchanged by that act.\n\n These two acts of Congress, providing that any rule, regulation, or contract for limitation of notice to less than 90 days shall be unlawful, are such unmistakable declarations of public policy as to a shorter notice limitation, under any circumstances, that in my judgment it should be applied to claims for personal injury, even though the statute, in terms, applies only to damages to property, unless there are cogent reasons for distinguishing the two classes of claims from each other. Congress should not have a 90-day reasonable standard in such matters and this court a 30- day standard.\n The opinion of the court gives this as a sufficient reason for such distinction:\n'The decisions that we have cited show that the time would have been sufficient, but for the statute, in respect of damage to goods, and the reasons are stronger to uphold it as adequate for personal injuries. A record is kept of goods, yet even as to them reasonably prompt notice is necessary as a check upon fraud. There is no record of passengers, and the practice of fraud is too common to be ignored.'\n\n With all deference, I submit that the reason thus given is unsound, because the likelihood is much greater that fraudulent claims will be made for injuries to goods than to persons, for the reason that most goods are packed for shipment and whether they are damaged or not cannot be discovered until they are unpacked after having left the custody of the carrier, but it must be rare indeed that a passenger can be injured except in the presence of some one or more of the carrier's agents. Such living and alert \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n witnesses are a much better protection against fraud than the indefinite and hurried record that is kept of goods.\n In addition, the fact that cases involving notice limitations with respect to goods have been appearing frequently in this court for 50 years- ever since Express Co. v. Caldwell, 21 Wall. 264, was decided-while counsel agree that the case we are considering is the first of its kind with respect to passengers to find its way here or, so far as they can discover, into any court, is very strong evidence that fraudulent claims for damages to goods are more frequent than for injury to persons. If the carriers had needed and had used such limitations on personal injury claims as much as they needed and used them as to claims for damages to goods, some of them would have found their way into reported cases long ere this. As a matter of fact, however, this notice limitation upon passenger injury claims is a recent innovation. It appears for the first time in the live stock contract of the respondent, effective November 2, 1915-as if in defiant response to the Cummins amendment of the preceding March. And in the Uniform Live Stock Contract, prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its report of October 21, 1921, no such limitation is permitted. Interstate Commerce Reports. In re Domestic Bill of Lading and Live Stock Contract, 64 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 357, Appendix F. Under this prescribed form of contract, the latest word on the subject, a 30-day limit, such as the court is approving, would be as unlawful as it would have been under the statute had it been applied to a claim for injury suffered by Gooch's cattle in the same accident in which he was injured.\n These considerations answer also the suggestion in the opinion of the court that Congress must have considered claims by passengers when considering claim for property and have decided that they deserved different treatment. Such a limitation on passenger claims had never \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n been heard of at that time, but we may be sure it will be found in every railroad ticket promptly upon the publication of the court's opinion in this case, unless prohibited by statute.\n This court is passing for the first time upon such a rule as we have here andbelieving that no sound reasons have been given for distinguishing between notice requirements for property and for passenger claims, I think it is the duty of the court to accept the rule of public policy prescribed by Congress and to apply it to personal injury claims by declaring this 30- day rule too short to be reasonable, and that it is therefore void under the Piper Case, supra.\n Second. That such a rule is unjust and discriminatory, and therefore unreasonable, is very clearly shown by the operation of a like rule in freight cases.\n In the Matter of Bills of Lading, 29 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 417, 419, and In re the Cummins Amendment, 33 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 682, 691, the Interstate Commerce Commission says that while the uniform bill of lading had long contained a four months' limitation for presenting damage claims for freight, no effort had been made by carriers generally to enforce it until the Croninger Case was decided in January, 1913 (\n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. [N. S.] 257), but that in December of that year they began to enforce it literally 'and thereby created a multitude of unjust discriminations.' Only about one year of such enforcement was necessary to cause the enactment of the Cummins Amendment on March 4, 1915, which made an end of the matter where property was damaged in transit by negligence, and in any case rendered a limitation to less than 90 days unlawful.\n That a notice rule so short as 30 days must result in discrimination seems to me clear, also, because of that characteristic of human nature, not sufficiently taken into account by many courts. Persons and property are \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n usually transported so safely by rail that though of damage rarely enters the mind of the occasional shipper or traveler, and from this it results that rules, such as we have here, are not read, or, if read, are not understood, couched, as they usually are, in forms of expression about the meaning of which courts are in constant disagreement, with the result that while the large shippers know of and keep within such rules and recover their losses, for the occasional small shippers they serve as a trap in which, they are often caught and ruined. The Cummins Amendment is the protest of the country against the discrimination and hardship which many federal and state court decisions show resulted all over the country, from the enforcement of such a rule as to property claims.\n To these reasons for holding the rule in this case unjust and discriminatory must be added the certainty, inherent in its form, that if enforced it will be an agency of grave injustice.\n Not only is the requirement unusual and unreasonable that the notice shall be given only to the general manager of a great system of railway, remote and unknown as he must be to most of the patrons of the road, but, as a shipper seldom accompanies his property-a drover is almost the only instance in which he does-he is usually at least in physical condition to make prompt claim if his property is damaged, but many men are so badly injured in railway accidents that they are wholly incapable of making claim in writing within 30 days, and to prepare the way for a law suit is the last thought of a man who is seriously injured and suffering. It is true that the rule considerately permits the claim to be made by 'the heirs and personal representatives' of one who may be killed-but it, unfortunately, he should die toward the end or very near the end of the 30 days, this astutely worded rule would cut out dis dependents from all right \n\n[258 U.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n to recover. The rule is a novel and cunning device to defeat the normal liability of carriers and should not be made a favorite of the courts.\n Believing, as I do, for the reasons thus stated, that the thirty-day notice really is much more unjust when applied to passenger than to property claims and also because its application will work as grave discrimination and injustice in other cases as it so palpably does in this case, I think the rule of public policy declared in the Cummins Amendment should be followed and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McKENNA concur in this dissenting opinion. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRANT SMITH-PORTER SHIP CO. v. ROHDE(1922)\nNo. 35\nArgued: December 7, 1920Decided: January 3, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles A.

C., for Rohde.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Asking for instruction, the court below has sent up the following certificate and questions. Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216).\n'This cause came to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upon an appeal from the United States District Court of Oregon from a judgment in favor of the appellee as libelant in that court, and against the appellant as libelee in that court, for the sum of $10,000. The cause was a libel in admiralty for damages for injury sustained.\n\n'Libelant, Herman F. Rohde, received injury while at work on a partially completed vessel lying at a dock in the Willamette River forming a part of the shipbuilding plant of respondent, Grant Smith- Porter Ship Company. The character of the work being done by libelant and the \n\n[257 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n operations of respondent of which the work formed a part are as follows: Respondent, Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company, at and prior to the time of libelant's injury was engaged in constructing steam vessels for the United States government under contract with United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. One of these steam vessels was the steamer 'Ahala.' Prior to the time of libelant's injury this steamer had been launched in the Willamette River at Portland, Oregon, which river is a part of the navigable waters of the United States. At the time of libelant's injury, April 10, 1919, the vessel had been substantially completed, but was not ready for delivery and all of the work in process at the time of libelant's injury was work pertaining to the construction of the vessel by respondent, Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company. Libelant's work was that of a carpenter or joiner and at the time of the injury he was at work constructing a bulkhead enclosing certain tanks in the vessel.\n\n'Libelant began this proceeding in personam against respondent in the District Court of the United States for the District of Oregon sitting in admiralty. Negligence of the employer, respondent Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company, in the construction and maintenance of a scaffold is alleged as the ground for recovering of damages.\n\n'At and prior to the time of libelant's injury, there was in effect the so-called 'Workmen's Compensation Law' of the State of Oregon ( chapter 112, Laws of Oregon, 1913, as amended chapter 271, Laws of 1915, and chapter 288, Laws of 1917). The law applied to hazardous occupations (including shipbuilding) within the State of Oregon. An option is given both to employers and workmen to accept the compensation law or to reject it; that is, both employers and workmen are required to notify the proper state authority if it is desired not to come under the act. Without such notice, the law is applicable and payments are required to be made by the employer, which \n\n[257 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n payments include deductions from the wages of workmen. Workmen who thus come under the act are entitled to receive certain specified payments in the event of injury, and the act provides (section 12): 'And the right to receive such sum or sums shall be in lieu of all claims against his employer on account of such injury or death, except as hereinafter specifically provided.'\n\n'At and prior to the time of libelant's injury, respondent was engaged in shipbuilding operations on the Willamette River at Portland within the State of Oregon; and libelant was in its employ as a carpenter or joiner in such shipbuilding operations. Prior to the time of the injury, neither respondent, the employer, nor libelant, the workman, had notified the appropriate state authority of any rejection of the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, and up to the time of the injury, respondent, the employer, had taken all the steps required by the compensation act to bring the work under its provisions; and there had been deducted and paid over to the commission administering the compensation fund payments from wages earned and paid libelant, the workman, up to the time of the injury. Payroll deductions from the wages of libelant and other workmen were made without regard to whether or not the work done by such workman was on vessels under construction on the ways or vessels under construction after launching.\n\n'Questions of law concerning which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit desires the instruction of the Supreme Court are: ( 1) Is there jurisdiction in admiralty because the alleged tort occurred on navigable waters? (2) Is libelant entitled because of his injury to proceed in admiralty against respondent for the damages suffered?'\n\n The contract for constructing 'The Ahala' was nonmaritime, and although the incompleted structure upon which the accident occurred was lying in navigable waters, \n\n[257 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n neither Rohde's general employment, nor his activities at the time, had any direct relation to navigation or commerce. Thames Towboat Co. v. Schooner Francis McDonald, \n254 U.S. 242\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 65. The injury was suffered within a State whose positive enactment prescribed an exclusive remedy therefor. And as both parties had accepted and proceeded under the statute by making payments to the Industrial Accident Fund it cannot properly be said that they consciously contracted with each other in contemplation of the general system of maritime law. of the general system of maritime law. Sup. Ct. 112. Under such circumstances regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule would not necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia (decided December 5, 1921) \n257 U.S. 233\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 89.\n The general doctrine that in contract matters admiralty jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the transaction and in tort matters upon the locality, has been so frequently asserted by this Court that it must now be treated as settled.

Garcia we recently pointed out that as to certain local matters regulation of which would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, the rules of the latter might be modified or supplemented by state statutes. The present case is controlled by that principle. The statute of the State applies and defines the rights and liabilities of the parties. The employee may assert his claim against the Industrial Accident Fund to which both he and the employer have contributed as provided by the statute, but he cannot recover damages in an admiralty court.\n This conclusion accords with Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Chelentis v. Luckenback Steamship Co., \n247 U.S. 372\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 501; Union Fish Co. v.

In each of them the employment or contract was maritime in nature and the rights and liabilities of the parties were prescribed by general rules of maritime law essential to its proper harmony and uniformity. Here the parties contracted with reference to the state statute; their rights and liabilities had no direct relation to navigation, and the application of the local law cannot materially affect any rules of the sea whose uniformity is essential.\n As pointed out in the Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 17, 18 (54 L. Ed. 1039, 20 Ann.

CO. v. MERCHANTS' ELEVATOR CO.(1922)\nNo. 202\nArgued: April 18, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John F. Finerty, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioners.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold S. Simpson, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the Merchants' Elevator Company in a state court of Minnesota against the Great Northern Railway Company and the Director General to recover $80 alleged to have been exacted in violation of the carrier's tariff. That sum had been demanded by the carrier, under rule 10 of its tariff, as a reconsignment charge, at the rate of $5 a car, for 16 cars of corn shipped from points in Iowa and Nebraska to Willmar, Minn., and after inspection there rebilled to Anoka, a station beyond. The tariff rate from the points of origin via Willmar to Anoka was the same as to Willmar. Willmar had been named as destination in the original bill of lading, only because it is the place at which grain coming into the state by this route is inspected and graded under the laws of Minnesota and of the United States, and the carrier knew, or should have known, that fact. Immediately after inspection, disposition orders were given, and the original bills of lading were surrendered in exchange for billing to Anoka. Rule 10 read:- \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n 'Diversion or reconsignment to points outside switching limits before placement: If a car is diverted, reconsigned or reforwarded on orders placed with the local freight agent or other designated officer after arrival of car at original destination, but before placement for unloading, ... a charge of $5.00 per car will be made if car is diverted, reconsigned or reforwarded to a point outside of switching limits of original destination.'\n The shipper contended that the case was within the exception known as exception (a), as amended by supplement 1, which provided that rules ( including rule 10) shall not apply to:\n'(a) Grain, seed (field), seed (grass), hay or straw, carloads, held in cars on track for inspection and disposition orders incident thereto at billed destination or at point intermediate thereto.'\n\n Whether the charge was payable depended solely upon a question of construction; that is, whether the body of the rule or the exception to it applied. On this question there was room for reasonable difference of opinion. The carrier, relying partcularly upon Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., \n234 U.S. 138\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 885, and Loomis v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 43\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 228, claimed seasonably that until the true construction of the tariff had been determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the trial court was without jurisdiction. That court overruled the objection, construed the exception to mean that cars of grain are exempted from rule 10 if held on track at billed destination for inspection and for 'disposition orders' incident to such inspection, held that the disposition order may be an order to make disposition by way of reconsignment to another destination and that forwarding to Anoka was such disposition, and entered judgment for the shipper. That judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state on the authority of Reliance Elevator Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., 139 Minn. \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n 69, 165 N. W. 867. The case is here on writ of certiorari. Merritt v. United States, \n255 U.S. 567\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 375. The tariff containing the rule under which the $5 charge was made was the only governing tariff. It had been duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The validity of the tariff, including the rule and exception, was admitted, and there was no dispute concerning the facts. The question argued before us is not whether the state courts erred in construing or applying the tariff, but whether any court had jurisdiction of the controversy, in view of the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission had not passed upon the disputed question of construction.\n The contention that courts are without jurisdiction of cases involving a disputed question of construction of an interstate tariff, unless there has been a preliminary resort to the Commission for its decision, rests in the main, upon the following argument: The purpose of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) is to secure and preserve uniformity. Hence, the carrier is required to file tariffs establishing uniform rates and charges, and is prohibited from exacting or accepting any payment not set forth in the tariff. Uniformity is impossible, if the several courts, state or federal, are permitted, in case of disputed construction, to determine what the rate or charge is which the tariff prescribes. To insure uniformity the true construction must, in case of dispute, be determined by the Commission.\n This argument is unsound. It is true that uniformity is the paramount purpose of the Commerce Act. But it is not true that uniformity formity in construction of a tariff can be attained only through a preliminary resort to the Commission to settle the construction in dispute. Every question of the construction of a tariff is deemed a question of law; and where the question concerns an interstate tariff it is one of federal law. If the parties properly preserve their rights, a construction given by any court, whether it be federal or state, may ultimately be reviewed by this court either on writ of error or on writ of certiorari; and \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 291]\n\u00a0\n thereby uniformity in construction may be secured. Hence, the attainment of uniformity does not require that in every case where the construction of a tariff is in dispute, there shall be a preliminary resort to the Commission.\n Whenever a rate, rule, or practice is attacked as unreasonable or as unjustly discriminatory, there must be preliminary resort to the Commission. Sometimes this is required because the function being exercised is in its nature administrative in contradistinction to judicial. But ordinarily the determining factor is not the character of the function, but the character of the controverted question and the nature of the enquiry necessary for its solution. To determine what rate, rule or practice shall be deemed reasonable for the future is a legislative or administrative function. To determine whether a shipper has in the past been wronged by the exaction of an unreasonable or discriminatory rate is a judicial function. Preliminary resort to the Commission is required alike in the two classes of cases. It is required because the inquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical matters; and uniformity can be secured only if its determination is left to the Commission. Moreover, that determination is reached ordinarily upon voluminous and conflicting evidence, for the adequate appreciation of which acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation is indispensable, and such acquaintance is commonly to be found only in a body of experts. But what construction shall be given to a railroad tariff presents ordinarily a question of law which does not differ in character from those presented when the construction of any other document is in dispute.\n When the words of a written instrument are used in their ordinary meaning, their construction presents a question solely of law. But words are used sometimes in a peculiar meaning. Then extrinsic evidence may be necessary \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 292]\n\u00a0\n to determine the meaning of words appearing in the document. This is true where technical words or phrases not commonly understood are employed, or extrinsic evidence may be necessary to establish a usage of trade or locality which attaches provisions not expressed in the language of the instrument. Where such a situation arises, and the peculiar meaning of words, or the existence of a usage, is proved by evidence, the function of construction is necessarily preceded by the determination of the matter of fact. Where the controversy over the writing arises in a case which is being tried before a jury, the decision of the question of fact is left to the jury, with instructions from the court as to how the document shall be construed, if the jury finds that the alleged peculiar meaning or usage is established. \n1\n But where the document to be construed is a tariff of an interstate carrier, and before it can be construed it is necessary to determine upon evidence the peculiar meaning of words or the existence of incidents alleged to be attached by usage to the transaction, the preliminary determination must be made by the Commission; and not until this determination has been made, can a court take jurisdiction of the controversy. If this were not so, that uniformity which it is the purpose of the Commerce Act to secure could not be attained. For the effect to be given the tariff might depend, not upon construction of the language-a question of law-but upon whether or not a particular judge or jury had found, as a fact, that the words of the document were used in the peculiar sense attributed to them or that a particular usage existed. \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 293]\n\u00a0\n It may happen that there is a dispute concerning the meaning of a tariff which does not involve, properly speaking, any question of construction. The dispute may be merely whether words in the tariff were used in their ordinary meaning, or in a peculiar meaning. This was the situation in the American Tie & Timber Co. Case, supra. The legal issue was whether the carrier did or did not have in effect a rate covering oak ties. The only matter really in issue was whether the word 'lumber' which was in the tariff, had been used in a peculiar sense. The trial judge charged the jury:\n'If you believe from the evidence that oak railway cross-ties are lumber within the meaning and usage of the lumber and railroad business, then you are charged the defendant had in effect a rate applying on the ties offered for shipment.'\n\n This question was obviously not one of construction; and there is not to be found in the opinion in this court, or in the proceedings in either of the lower courts, a suggestion that the case involved any disputed question of construction. The only real question in the case was one of fact; and upon this question of fact 'the views of men engaged in the lumber and railroad business, as developed in the testimony' were in 'irreconcilable conflict.' \n234 U.S. 146\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 888. As that question, unlike one of construction, could not be settled ultimately by this court, preliminary resort to the Commission was necessary to insure uniformity. The situation in Loomis v. Lehigh Valley R. R., supra, was similar. There the question to be decided did not require the consideration of voluminous conflicting evidence; but it involved the exercise of administrative judgment. The carrier had been requested by a shipper of grain, fruits and vegetables to supply cars for loading. In order to load ordinary box cars to the minimum capacity on which the freight rates are based and to the maximum to which the shipper is entitled, it is necessary that they should be equipped with grain doors or transverse bulkheads, so that they may \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 294]\n\u00a0\n safely contain the load and enable unloading to be done without waste and inconvenience. Those sent lacked the inside doors and bulkheads. The carrier having refused to furnish these, the shipper was obliged to do so and sought reimbursement. The tariff was silent on the subject. The controverted question was not how the tariff should be construed, but what character of equipment should be deemed reasonable. To determine this inquiry the court held that preliminary resort to the Commission must be had, because 'an adequate consideration of the ... controversy would require acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation and a consequent appreciation of the practical effect of any attempt to define services covered by a carrier's published tariffs, or character of equipment which it must provide, or allowances which it may make to shippers for instrumentalities supplied and services rendered.'\n In the case at bar the situation is entirely different from that presented in the American Tie & Timber Co. Case, or in the Loomis Case. Here no fact, evidential or ultimate, is in controversy, and there is no occasion for the exercise of administrative discretion. The task to be performed is to determine the meaning of words of the tariff which were used in their ordinary sense and to apply that meaning to the undisputed facts. That operation was solely one of construction; and preliminary resort to the Commission was, therefore, unnecessary. The petition for certiorari was asked for on the ground that the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in this case was in conflict with the above decisions of this court and also that the decisions in several state courts and in the lower federal courts were in serious conflict on the question involved. In the brief and argument on the merits, it was also asserted that some recent decisions of this court are in conflict with the rule declared and applied in the American Tie & Timber Co. Case, supra, and the Loomis \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 295]\n\u00a0\n Case, supra. If in examining the cases referred to2 there is borne in mind the distinction above discussed between \n\n[259 U.S. 285, 296]\n\u00a0\n controversies which involve only questions of law and those which involve issues essentially of fact or call for the exercise of administrative discretion, it will be found that the conflict described does not exist and that the decisions referred to are in harmony also with reason.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Goddard v.

C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the federal court for Western Pennsylvania against the collector of internal revenue to recover part of an amount assessed as estate tax under the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, tit. II, 39 Stat. 756, 777 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/2a-6336 1\/2m), and paid by the plaintiff as executrix of the estate of Kate B. Kingsley. In determining the net value of the estate upon the transfer of which the tax was imposed, the collector had included bonds issued by political subdivisions of the state of Pennsylvania. The executrix claimed that to include these municipal bonds was in effect to tax them-which the federal government is under the Constitution without power to do. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 583\n, 654 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 618\n, 693 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 912. The District Court overruled this claim and entered judgment for defendant. The case comes here on writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). Whether Congress has power to require that state and \n\n[258 U.S. 384, 387]\n\u00a0\n municipal bonds held by decedent be included for the purpose of determining the net value on which the estate tax is imposed is the sole question presented for decision.\n That the federal government has power to tax the transmission of legacies was settled by Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747; and that it has the power to tax the transfer of the net assets of a decedent's estate was settled by New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 U.S. 345\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660. The latter case has established also that the estate tax imposed by the act of 1916, like the earlier legacy or succession tax, is a duty or excise, and not a direct, tax like that on income from municipal bonds. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra. A state may impose a legacy tax on a bequest to the United States (United States v. Perkins, \n163 U.S. 625\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1073, 41 Sup. Ct. 287), or on a bequest which consists wholly of United States bonds (Plummer v. Coler, \n178 U.S. 115\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 829; Orr v. Gilman, \n183 U.S. 278\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 213). Likewise the federal government may impose a succession tax upon a bequest to a municipal corporation of a state (Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 U.S. 249\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 803), or may, in determining the amount for which the estate tax is assessable, under the act of 1916, include sums required to be paid to a state as inheritance tax, for the estate tax is the antithesis of a direct tax (New York Trust Co., v. Eisner, supra). Municipal bonds of a state stand in this respect in no different position from money payable to it. The transfer upon death is taxable, whatsoever the character of the property transferred and to whomsoever the transfer is made. It follows that in determining the amount of decedent's net estate municipal bonds were properly included.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGROGAN v. HIRAM WALKER & SONS(1922)\nNo. 615\nArgued: April 19, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Goff, for appellants Grogan et al. and appellee Aldridge.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred Lucking, of Detroit, Mich., for appellee Hiram Walker & Sons, Limited.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lucien H. Beers, of New York City, for appellant Anchor Line, limited.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 80, 87]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases raise the question whether the Constitution and the Volstead Act prohibit the transportation of intoxicating liquors from a foreign port through some part of the United States to another foreign port. The first is a bill by a corporation of Canada against the Collector of Customs and the Collector of Internal Revenue for the Eastern District of Michigan to prevent their carrying out the orders of the Treasury Department to stop the plaintiffs from shipping whiskey intended as a beverage from Canada by way of Detroit in bond through the United States to Mexico, Central or South America. The irreparable injury that will be done to the plaintiff's business is fully shown, and the decision depends on the single question stated above. An injunction was granted by the District Court. Walker v. Lawson, 275 Fed. 373. The second case is to prevent similar interference with the transshipment of whiskey from one British ship to another in the harbor of New York. Upon a consideration of the same general questions an injunction was refused by the District \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 88]\n\u00a0\n Court for the Southern District of New York, October 21, 1921\n\n\n The plaintiffs rely upon Rev. St.  3005, as amended (Comp. St.  5690), and Article XXIX of the treaty, concluded with Great Britain on May 8, 1871 (17 Stat. 863). By the former, an exemption in a revenue act, merchandise arriving at any port of the United States destined for any foreign country may be entered at the custom house and conveyed in transit through the territory of the United States, without the payment of duties, under such regulations as to examination and transportation as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. See United States v. Yuginovich, June 1, 1921, \n256 U.S. 450\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 551. By the treaty, for the term of years mentioned in Article XXXIII merchandise arriving at the ports of New York, Boston and Portland, and other ports specially designated by the President, and destined for British possessions in North America may be entered at the customs house and may be conveyed in transit without the payment of duties through the territory of the United States under such rules, &c., as the Government of the United States may prescribe; and under like rules, &c., from such possessions through the territory of the United States for export from the said ports of the United States. President Cleveland and President Harrison in messages to Congress expressed the opinion that Article XXIX had been abrogated. In view of the parallelism between the statute and the treaty the question seems of no importance except so far as the existence of the treaty might be supposed to intensify the reasons for construing later legislation as not overruling it. But make-weights of that sort are not enough to affect the result here.\n On the other side is the Eighteenth Amendment forbidding 'the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 89]\n\u00a0\n territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes.' There is also the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, title 2,  3, 41 Stat. 305, 308, which provides that except as therein authorized, after the Eighteenth Amendment goes into effect no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor. All the provisions of the act are to be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.\n The routine arguments are pressed that this country does not undertake to regulate the habits of people elsewhere and that the references to beverage purposes and use as a beverage show that it was not attempting to do so; that it has no interest in meddling with transportation across its territory if leakage in transit is prevented as it has been; that the repeal of statutes and a fortiori of treaties by implication is not to be favored; and that even if the letter of a law seems to have that effect a thing may be within the letter yet not within the law when it has been construed. We appreciate all this, but are of opinion that the letter is too strong in this case.\n The Eighteenth Amendment meant a great revolution in the policy of this country, and presumably and obviously meant to upset a good many things on as well as off the statute book. It did not confine itself in any meticulous way to the use of intoxicants in this country. If forbade export for beverage purposes elsewhere. True this discouraged production here, but that was forbidden already, and the provision applied to liquors already lawfully made. See Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 151, n. 1, 40 Sup. Ct. 106. It is obvious that those whose wishes and opinions were embodied in the Amendment meant to stop the whole business. They did not want intoxicating liquor in the United States and reasonably may have thought that if they let it in some \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 90]\n\u00a0\n of it was likely to stay. When, therefore, the Amendment forbids not only importation into and exportation from the United States but transportation within it, the natural meaning of the words expresses an altogether probable intent. The Prohibition Act only fortifies in this respect the interpretation of the Amendment itself. The manufacture, possession, sale and transportation of spirits and wine for other than beverage purposes are provided for in the act, but there is no provision for transshipment or carriage across the country from without. When Congress was ready to permit such a transit for special reasons, in the Canal Zone, it permitted it in express words. Title 3,  20; 41 Stat. 322.\n Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., \n254 U.S. 88\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 31, 10 A. L. R. 1548, was decided on the ground that the liquors were in the strictest sense in the possession of the owner (\n254 \nU.S. 92, 93\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 31, 10 A. L. R. 1548; see Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, \n198 \nU.S. 530, 537\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 766), and that to move them from the warehouse to the dwelling was no more transportation in the sense of the statute than to take them from the cellar to the dining room; whereas in Corneli v. Moore, January 30, 1922, \n257 U.S. 491\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 176, they were not in the owner's possession and required delivery and transportation to become so. In United States v. Gudger, \n249 U.S. 373\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 323, the only point was that transportation through a State was not transportation into it within the meaning of the statute before the Court. None of these cases has any bearing upon the question here. We are of opinion that the decree in Grogan v. Hiram Walker & Sons, Ltd., should be reversed, and the decree in The Anchor Line, Ltd., v. Aldridge, affirmed.\n 615. Decree reversed.\n 639. Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court. \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 91]\n\u00a0\n The first case presents the right to transport intoxicating liquor in bond through the United States in accordance with certain rights given by the Revised Statutes and a treaty with Great Britain, notwithstanding the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution and its auxiliary ligislation, the Volstead Act.\n The second case concerns the transshipment of like liquor from one British ship to another British ship in New York harbor. In the first case it was decided that the right of transportation still exists. Walker v. Lawson (D. C.) 275 Fed. 373. In the second case a prohibitive effect was ascribed to the amendment and the legislation.\n The factors of decision are the policies constituted by the amendment to the Constitution, the statute enacted in aid of it, other statutes preceding it, and a treaty of the United States with Great Britain. And their relation is to be determined, and range. What shall be the test of determination? The words of the instruments? These, indeed, may make individuality, and express purposes, but if the purposes collide, which must give way? And upon what considerations? It is view of the court that the purposes do collide, and the court assigns prevailing force to the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act-the reform they instituted having annulled section 3005 of the Revised Statutes as amended, and article XXIX of the treaty with Great Britain, May 8, 1871.\n I am unable to assent. The factors are not in antagonism, but each has a definite purpose consistent with the purpose of every other.\n I consider first the Eighteenth Amendment. Its provision is that one year from the date of its ratification, the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from, the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes, is prohibited. \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 92]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that the amendment provides against the manufacture, sale and certain movements of intoxicating liquors. Those movements are its transportation within, its importation into, and its exportation from, the United States. The last two may be put immediately out of consideration. The liquor in the cases at bar, neither in common nor legal sense, was an importation into the United States or exportation from it. \n1\n Importation and exportation are constituted of something more than ingress of the intoxicants, under bond, at one border of the country and egress, under bond, at another border, the purpose being for passage only through the country, and having as impalpable effect upon it as if the passage were by airship. Still less, if I may suppose the impossible, is the transshipment of liquors in New York Harbor from one British ship to another under the supervision of revenue officers, the importation or exportation of the liquors into or from the United States.\n The other movement is a case of transportation within the United States in the literal sense of the words, but this court in Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., \n254 U.S. 88\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 31, 10 A. L. R. 1548, has limited its apparent universality by accommodating it to conditions and pre-existent rights, and this against the executive and reforming zeal of a public officer sustained by the judgment of a district court, thereby applying the rule, denominated by Mr. Justice Brewer as 'familiar,' and variously illustrated by him, in Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 511, that a statute should not be taken at its word against its spirit, and intention. The rule has had illustration since, and this court following it, and its sanction in common sense declared \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 93]\n\u00a0\n against the destructive revolution urged, based upon the literal meaning of words. The court decided that it was not 'unlawful to have or possess' ( the words of the Volstead Act) liquors, and that transportation thereof from a room leased in a public warehouse, where they were stored, to the dwelling house of the owner of them for consumption for himself and family was not adverse to the act or to the Eighteenth Amendment. The decision was only possible by rejecting the literal meaing of the words unlawful 'to have or possess' intoxicating liquors or the 'transportation' of them 'within the United States' and accommodating those words to the spirit and intention of their use.\n In Corneli v. Moore, decided on January 30th of this term, a distinction between a room leased in a public warehouse and a public warehouse was made, and the transportation from the latter was decided to be prohibited. In other words, it was decided that liquor in a public warehouse was not in possession of the owner of the liquor, and that therefore its removal from the warehouse was a transportation of it within the United States from one place to another. The intention of the word was satisfied and the case is consistent with Street v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co.\n But in United States v. Gudger, \n249 U.S. 373\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 323, it was decided that the transportation of liquor through a state was not transportation into it, within the meaning of a provision in the Post Office Appropriation Bill. To me the case is decisive of those at bar.\n With the suggestion of it and the other cases in our minds, let us consider what meaning and purpose are to be assigned to the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. It is certainly the first sense of every law that its field of operation is the country of its enactment. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047. And this is true of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, and necessarily they get their meaning \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 94]\n\u00a0\n from the field and purpose of their operation-from the conditions which exist in that field or designed to be established there. The transportation that they prohibit is transportation within that field-that is, the United States and 'for beverage purposes.' The importance of the purposes suggests the emphasis of italics, and the Volstead Act is at pains to declare that it shall be construed 'to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.'\n The transportation and the purposes are therefore complements of each ohter, and both must exist to fulfill the declared prohibition. Enither exist in the cases at bar-the transportation in neither is, in the sense of the amendment and act, 'within' the United States 'for beverage purposes.' In one it is through the United States, in the other transshipment in a port of the United States, and both under the direction and control of the revenue officers of the United States and for use in other countries than the United States. Not only, therefore, are the cases not within the prohibition of the Eighteenth Amendment or the Volstead Act, but they are directly within section 3005 of the Revised Statutes and the treaty with Great Britain. In the view of the court, however, the section and the treaty have been extinguished-superseded by a world-wide reform that cannot tolerate any aid by the United States to the offensive liquor.\n'The Eighteenth Amendment,' is the declaration, 'meant a great revolution in the policy of this country,' and did not timidly confine itself 'to the use of intoxicants in this country.' There is appeal in the declaration. It presents the attractive spectacle of a people too animated for reform to hesitate to make it as broad as the universe of humanity. One feels almost ashamed to utter a doubt of such a noble and moral cosmopolitanism, but the facts of the world must be adduced and what they dictate. They are the best answer to magnified sentiment. \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 95]\n\u00a0\n And the sentiment is magnified. The amendment and the Volstead Act were not intended to direct the practices of the world. Such comprehensive purpose resides only in assertion and conjecture and rejects the admonitory restraint of section 3005, the treaty with Great Britain and the noninterfering deference that nations pay to the practices of one another.\n\n If such mission had been the purpose it would have been eagerly avowed, not have been left to disputable inference. Zeal takes care to be explicit in purpose, and it cannot be supposed that section 3005 (Comp. St .  5690) and the treaty were unknown and their relation-harmony or conflict-with the new policy, and it must have been concluded that there was harmony, not conflict. The section and the treaty support the conclusion. The section permits all merchandise arriving at certain ports of the United States and destined for places in the adjacent British provinces, and arriving at certain ports and destined for places in Mexico, to be entered at the custom house and conveyed in transit through the United States. In a sense, it has its complement in section 3006 (section 5691), which gives to merchandise of the United States the same facility of transportation through the British provinces or the Republic of Mexico.\n The treaty (article XXIX) provides a reciprocation of privileges. Merchandise arriving at ports in the United States and destined for British possessions in North America may be entered at the proper custom house and conveyed in transit through the United States without payment of duties. A like privilege is given United States merchandise arriving at ports in the British possessions for transit through those possessions.\n In other words, the treaty is an exchange of trade advantages- advantages not necessary to the commerce of either, but affording to that commerce a facility. And yet, it is said, that it is the object of the Eighteenth Amendment to take away that facility, and to take away \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 96]\n\u00a0\n the transshipment of liquor in an American port from one British ship to another. This is the only accomplishment! What estimate can be put upon it? It takes away not a necessity of British commerce, as I have said, but a convenience to it, in disregard of a concession recognized by law and by a treaty. And upon what prompting? Universal reform? If so why was the Panama Canal given up as a convenience to the prohibited beverage and apparently with purposeful care? There is a perversion in one or the other of those actions that needs to be accounted for. There seems to be a misunderstanding of their respective effects, an overlooking of their antagonism, if the purpose of our legislation be a reversal of things not only in the United States but elsewhere. To deny the distribution of intoxicants by forbidding them transit through the United States and affording them distribution through the Panama Canal cannot both be conducive to the world-wide reform which the court considers was the mission instituted by the Eighteenth Amendment and put in execution by the Volstead Act.\n It is said, however, that regarding the United States alone, the amendment and the act have a practical concern. If liquor be admitted for transit, is the declaration, some may stay for consumption. The apprehension is serious-not of itself, but because of its implication. It presents the United States in an invidious light. It is possible that its sovereignty, and what it can command, cannot protect a train of cars in transit from the Canadian border to the Mexican border or the removal of liquors from one ship to another from the stealthy invasions of inordinate appetites or the daring cupidity of bootleggers? But granting that the care of the government may relax, or its watchfulness may be evaded, is it possible that such occasional occurrences, such petty pilferings, can so determine the policy of the country as to justify the repeal \n\n[259 U.S. 80, 97]\n\u00a0\n of an act of Congress, and violation or abrogation of its treaty obligation by implication?\n I put my dissent upon the inherent improbability of such intention- not because it takes a facility from intoxicating liquor, but because of its evil and invidious precedent, and this at a time when the nations of the earth are assembling in leagues and conferences to assure one another that diplomacy is not deceit, and that there is a security in the declaration of treaties, not only against material aggression, but against infidelity to engagements when interest tempts or some purpose antagonizes. Indeed I may say there is a growing aspiration that the time will come when nations will not do as they please and bid their wills avouch it.\n I think the judgment in No. 615 should be affirmed, and that in No. 639 reversed.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Opinions of the Attorney General, vol. 27, p. 440; McLean v.

BUFFINGTON(1922)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., Edwin B. H. Tower, Jr., of Milwaukee, Wis., and Wm. S. Hodges, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Harley-Davidson Motor Company and Alexander Klein filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In substance it sets forth: That in a suit for infringement of letters patent relating to clutches for motorcycles, brought in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern \n\n[259 U.S. 414, 415]\n\u00a0\n District of Pennsylvania by the Eclipse Machine Company and Frederick E. Ellett against the petitioners, a decree was entered by the District Court dismissing the plaintiffs' bill. 244 Fed. 463. Upon appeal to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit the decree of the District Court was reversed. 252 Fed. 805, 164 C. C. A. 645. The District Court, pursuant to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, entered an interlocutory decree adjudging claims 1, 8, 11, and 12 of letters patent No. 1,018,890, and claim 1 of letters patent No. 1,071,992, to be valid and infringed by the petitioners, and granted an injunction, with reference to a master to take and state an account. Subsequently, in the proceedings before the master, petitioners insisted that the master should exclude from consideration certain other types of clutches, which are described. The later types, it is averred, were devised after and in view of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and were being largely manufactured and sold by the petitioners. But the master overruled the petitioners' contention and ordered that the accounting proceed as to said types of clutches. The petitioners filed a petition in the District Court, asking the court to direct the master to exclude from the accounting the clutches aforesaid; but the District Court denied the petition and confirmed the order of the master. Plaintiffs made and submitted a motion to the District Court, asking that petitioners be enjoined from manufacturing, using, or selling the types of clutches in controversy. The District Court entered an interlocutory order, granting an injunction and allowing an appeal from the order to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Petitioners thereafter duly perfected their appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, consisting of the judges named in the present petition. That court dismissed the appeal without passing upon the merits thereof, although it was properly taken under section 129 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1121). Petitioners prayed for the writ of \n\n[259 U.S. 414, 416]\n\u00a0\n mandamus to the judges constituting the Circuit Court of Appeals, and to that court, commanding them and it to entertain and determine the appeal, and for such other relief as might seem appropriate and in conformity to law.\n An order to show cause was issued, and a return made by the judges. The cause now comes on for hearing on motion for judgment for the petitioners notwithstanding the return.\n The return sets forth that the order in the District Court granting the interlocutory injunction was entered pro forma as a means of propounding certain questions of infringement to the Circuit Court of Appeals which the District Court failed to pass upon. It recites the proceedings in the District Court in the attempt to exclude from the accounting the disputed types of clutches, and avers that in the course of the proceedings the District Court ruled that, while ordinarily it would be its duty to determine the question raised as to whether or not the particular types were within the decree of infringement, it suggested that the plaintiffs move for an injunction restraining petitioners (then defendants) from making, using, or vending the same, and that the District Court pro forma allow or deny the writ, that an appeal be promptly taken. A stipulation of counsel was filed in accordance with this suggestion. The District Court denied the motion to direct the course of accounting before the master, and allowed the interlocutory injunction pro forma. The return further sets forth that upon this record, supplemented by the frank statements of counsel to the same effect, the court declined to hear the appeal and dismissed it, leaving the order in question wholly within the control of the District Judge.\n Section 129 of the Judicial Code provides:\n'Where upon a hearing in equity in a District Court ... an injunction shall be granted, ... an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting ... an injunction.' \n\n[259 U.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n In a memorandum accompanying the return the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals set forth that the order below, having been made pro forma, without the exercise of judicial discretion by the District Court, did not present in any real sense an appealable order. The return further states that the order made was not in accord with the established practice in the Third Circuit; that the remedy to prevent the use of the clutches made after the decree, and claimed to have been in violation thereof, should have been sought by attachment for contempt, a proceeding for an accounting, or an original bill.\n\n We have examined the record before us on this application, which includes the opinions of the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. As this is an application for the writ of mandamus, we have no authority to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, such as we would have in cases brought before this court on appeal or writ of error. We accept-indeed, there is little room to question-the conclusion and judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the order of the District Court was made pro forma for the purpose of laying the foundation for an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, upon abundant showing, found that the District Judge, not wishing to exercise an independent judgment upon the questions raised, made a pro forma order granting the injunction to the end that an appeal might be prosecuted. This was done with the acquiescence of counsel. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the effect of this method of procedure was to submit the cause to it as though it were a court of original jurisdiction, and to put upon it a labor of examination and consideration not imposed by the statute. The purpose of the statute is to enable the Circuit Court of Appeals to review the order of the District Court after that court has itself heard and considered the application. The practice of thus entering pro forma judgments or de- \n\n[259 U.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n crees has been disapproved by this court in William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Bldg. Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., \n228 U.S. 645\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 722. See, also, United States v. Gleeson, \n124 U.S. 255\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 502.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it was not required to consider the order, thus made by the District Court, as one properly before it on its merits. But the Circuit Court of Appeals had acquired jurisdiction by the appeal, and did not reverse the order of the District Court and remand the cause for proper proceedings, as it might have done. It dismissed the appeal. The effect of such dismissal was to leave the interlocutory injunction in full force. In this respect the Circuit Court of Appeals failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred by law. The statute gave an appeal; the appellant had the right to have it decided. By the order of dismissal that right was denied.\n We conclude that a writ of mandamus should issue requiring the Circuit Court of Appeals to decide the appeal presented. That course will leave it within its power to reverse and remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with law, because of the view it took of the record growing out of the pro forma character of the order appealed from.\n Ordered accordingly. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAWES v. STATE OF GA.(1922)\nNo. 95\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Marion Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[258 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Indictment against Hawes under the law of Georgia for the offense of knowingly permitting certain persons to locate and have on his premises apparatus for distilling and manufacturing prohibited liquors and beverages.\n A verdict of guilty was rendered. A motion for new trial was made and denied, which action and the judgment of the trial court were affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the state.\n The act of the state (Acts Ex. Sess. 1917, p. 7) upon which the indictment was based made it unlawful, among other things, 'to distill, manufacture or make any alcoholic spirits, vinous or malted liquors or intoxicating beverages' in the state.\n Section 22 of the act provides that, when any apparatus used for such purposes--\n'is found or discovered upon said premises the same shall be prima facie evidence that the person in actual possession had knowledge of the existence of the same, and on conviction therefor, shall be punished as prescribed in section 16 of this act, the burden of proof in all cases being upon the person in actual possession to show the want of knowledge of the existence of such apparatus on his premises.'\n\n The trial court instructed the jury that Hawes was charged with knowing who had the apparatus upon the premises of which he was in possession or who operated it, and that under the act the burden was upon him to show the want of knowledge, and, further, that all that the state had to show was that the apparatus was on the premises, and, 'when the state shows that, stopping there, that makes out a prima facie case against defendant, and you should find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment,' unless he show that it, the apparatus, was there without his consent and knowledge. \n\n[258 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n The charge was made the basis of a motion for new trial on the ground that it was offensive to the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States and also of the Constitution of Georgia. The same grounds were assigned in the Supreme Court of the state on appeal from the order and judgment denying the motion for new trial.\n In the Supreme Court the specific error against the charge of the court was that it cast upon Hawes the burden of 'showing the want of knowledge of the existence of the apparatus on his premises, and in fine his innocence of the crime with which he is charged,' he 'claiming that this was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of its power by the Legislature of the state of Georgia.'\n And this is the assignment here; in other words, that section 22 creates a presumption of guilty knowledge from the finding of the apparatus upon premises occupied by him, and that both the trial court and the Supreme Court of Georgia enforced this statutory presumption, and the same therefore entered into his conviction, and that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was thereby violated.\n In aid of his contention and in emphasis of the effect of the statute against him, Hawes points out that a defendant in a criminal case is not allowed to testify as a witness, that he has only the right to make a statement not under oath, and that husband and wife are not competent or compellable to give evidence in any criminal proceeding for or against each other. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[258 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n It has been decided, as counsel concede, that the Legislature may make one fact prima facie evidence of another, and it is certainly within the established power of a state to prescribe the evidence which is to be received in the courts of its own government. Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585, 588\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 372.\n In Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 \nU.S. 210, 214\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 255, 257 (61 L. Ed. 678, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637) it is said:\n'The establishment of presumptions, and of rules respecting the burden of proof, is clearly within the domain of the state governments, and that a provision of this character, not unreasonable in itself and not conclusive of the rights of the party, does not constitute a denial of due process of law. Mobile, Jackson & Kansas City R. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 U.S. 35\n, 42.'\n\n Undoubtedly there must be a relation between the two facts. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 219\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 145; McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 U.S. 79\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 498. That is, if one may evidence the other, there must be connection between them, a requirement that reasoning insists on, and necessarily the law.\n We think the condition is satisfied by the Georgia statute. Distilling spirits is not an ordinary incident of a farm, and in a prohibition state has illicit character and purpose, and certainly is not so silent and obscure in use that one who rented a farm upon which it was or had been conducted would probably be ignorant of it. On the contrary, \n\n[258 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n it may be presumed that one on such a farm or one who occupies it will know what there is upon it. It is not arbitrary for the state to act upon the presumption and erect it into evidence of knowledge; not peremptory, of course, but subject to explanation, and affording the means of explanation. Hawes had such means. An explanatory statement was open to him with a detail of the circumstances of his acquisition of the place, and he availed himself of it. He could have called others to testify to the circumstances of his acquisition, for the circumstances were not so isolated or secret as not to have been known to others.\n We agree, therefore, with the Supreme Court of the state that the existence upon land of distilling apparatus, consisting of the still itself, boxes, and barrels, has a natural relation to the fact that the occupant of the land had knowledge of the existence of such objects and their situation.\n The principle and the presumption depending upon it were certainly not strained against Hawes. To the comment of the court we may add that the distilling apparatus was within 300 yards of his house. It is true that a pasture intervened, it was testified, between it and his house, and then 'a hill with pines growing on it, and there was a descent down a hill to where the still was located,' though 'it could not have been seen from the house, but smoke arising from it could have been seen. There was across the pasture a path leading towards the still.' It was added, however, 'that the path might have been made by cattle or stock.' And a witness testified that the path was old.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1036 of the Penal Code is as follows. 'In all criminal trials, the prisoner shall have the right to make to the court and jury such statement in the case as he may deem proper in his defense. It shall not be under oath, and shall have such force only as the jury may think right to give it. They may believe it in preference to the sworn testimony in the case. The prisoner shall not be compelled to answer any questions on cross-examination, should he think proper to decline to answer.'\n Section 1037 of the Penal Code is as follows: 'Husband and wife shall not be competent or compellable to give evidence in any criminal proceeding for or against each other, except that the wife shall be competent, but not compellable, to testify against her husband upon his trial for any criminal offense committed, or attempted to have been committed, upon her person. She is also a competent witness to testify for or against her husband in cases of abandonment of his child, as provided for in section 116 of this Code.' \n\n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEALD v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(1922)\nNo. 268\nArgued: April 13, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Vernon E. West and A. S. Worthington, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 114, 121]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. H. Stephens, of Washington, D. C., for the District of columbia. \n\n[259 U.S. 114, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n To aid in defraying the espenses of the District of Columbia Congress laid a tax of three-tenths of 1 per cent. on the value of the intangible property of persons resident, or engaged in business, within the District. Act of March 3, 1917, c. 160,  9, 39 Stat. 1004, 1046. This tax was assessed upon such property held by Heald and others, as committee of Peters, an insane person. They and their ward were residents of the District; the property was located there; and none of it consisted of municipal bonds or was otherwise of a character exempt by law from taxation. The committee, asserting that the taxing act violated the federal Constitution, paid the tax under protest, and brought this action in the Supreme Court of the District to recover the amount so paid. Judgment was there entered for the defendant. The case was then taken to the Court of Appeals of the District which sought by certificate to obtain from this court instructions as to the constitutionality of the act. The certificate was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Heald v. District of Columbia, \n254 U.S. 20\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 42. Thereupon the case was heard in the Court of Appeals, and it affirmed the judgment of the lower court. 50 App. D. C. 231, 269 Fed. 1015. The case is now here on writ of error. Peters having died, his executors, of whom Heald is the survivor, were substituted as plaintiffs in error.\n Plaintiff contends that the act is void: (a) Because it requires every nonresident of the District who engages in business therein to pay a tax on all his intangible property wherever situated or from whatever source derived; (b) because it requires a nonresident engaged in business within the District to pay a tax on all his credits or choses in action, whether due from residents or nonresidents, including those which have not been reduced to concrete form; (c) because it taxes bonds of states and their municipalities. The District insists that such is not the \n\n[259 U.S. 114, 123]\n\u00a0\n correct construction of the act, that it has not in fact been so construed or applied by the taxing officials, and that, even if it had been, the whole act would not thereby be rendered void, as these provisions are clearly severable from the rest of the act. Compare Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 161\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736; Ratterman v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n127 U.S. 411\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1127; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 U.S. 466\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 375, 66 L. Ed. --. But these objections, even if otherwise well founded, would not entitle plaintiff to challenge the validity of the tax. The property taxed is located within the District; those who hold it and the owner are residents; and there is no state or municipal bond among the property taxed. It has been repeatedly held that one who would strike down a state statute as violative of the federal Constitution must show that he is within the class of persons with respect to whom the act is unconstitutional and that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him. \n1\n In no case has it been held that a different rule applies where the statute assailed is an act of Congress; nor has any good reason been suggested why it should be so held. Compare United States v. Changler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 73\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 667; Straus v. Foxworth, \n231 \nU.S. 162, 171\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 42; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 U.S. 126\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 274, 66 L. Ed. --.\n Then it is contended that one clause of the act is void, because, in enumerating classes of property exempt from the tax on intangibles, it recites 'the shares of stock of business companies which by reason of or in addition to incorporation receive no special franchise or privilege.' The argument is that the meaning and application of this clause is so uncertain that the taxpayer is left without a guide in making his return. We have no occasion to inquire into the meaning or effect of this provision or \n\n[259 U.S. 114, 124]\n\u00a0\n whether it is open to the criticism leveled against it; for this plaintiff would likewise not be entitled to raise this objection, even if well founded, since it is not shown that any tax was levied on the basis of this clause or that it has subjected plaintiff either to injury or to embarrassment.\n Finally it is earnestly contended that the act is void, because it subjects the residents of the District to taxation without representation. Residents of the District lack the suffrage and have politically no voice in the expenditure of the money raised by taxation. Money so raised is paid into the treasury of the United States, where it is held, not as a separate fund for the District, but subject to the disposal of Congress, like other revenues raised by federal taxation. The objection that the tax is void, because of these facts, is fundamental and comprehensive. It is not limited in application to the tax on intangibles, but goes to the validity of all taxation of residents of the District. If sound, it would seem to apply, not only to taxes levied upon residents of the District for the support of the government of the District, but also to those taxes which are levied upon them for the support generally of the government of the United States. It is sufficient to say that the objection is not sound. There is no constitutional provision which so limits the power of Congress that taxes can be imposed only upon those who have political representation. And the cases are many in which laws levying taxes for the support of the government of the District have been enforced during the period in which its residents have been without the right of suffrage. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Albany County v.

THOMAS COLLIERY CO.(1922)\nNo. 541\nArgued: Decided: November 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, of New York City, and H. S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George E. Alter, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for defendants in error.\n Mr. J. Weston Allen, of Boston, Mass., on behalf of nine States, amicus curiae.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1913 the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by an act of its General Assembly (Act June 17, 1913 [P. L. 639]), imposed a tax of 2 1\/2 per cent. upon anthracite coal, and provided for the distribution of the tax.\n The act was adjudged a violation of the Constitution of the commonwealth, which required uniformity of taxation. Commonwealth v. Alden Coal Co., 251 Pa. 134, 96 Atl. 246, L. R. A. 1916F, 154, and Commonwealth v. St. Clair, 251 Pa. 159, 96 Atl. 254.\n In 1921 the commonwealth passed the act here involved (Act May 11, 1921 [P. L. 479]). It provided that from and after its passage each ton of anthracite coal mined, 'washed or screened, or otherwise prepared for market' in the commonwealth should be 'subject to a tax of 1 1\/2 per cent. of the value thereof when prepared for market.' It was provided that the tax should be assessed at the time when the coal has been subjected to the indicated preparation 'and is ready for shipment or market.'\n Plaintiff in error, alleging himself to be a stockholder of the Thomas Colliery Company, brought this suit to have the act adjudged and decreed to be unconstitutional and void, and to ejoin that company and its directors from complying with the act, and to enjoin defendant in error, Samuel L. Lewis, Auditor General of the Commonwealth, and the defendant in error, Charles A. Snyder, Treasurer of the commonwealth, from enforcing the act.\n The trial court, court of common pleas, decided against the relief prayed, distinguishing the case from those in which the act of 1913 was declared void, and adjudged and decreed that the suit be dismissed. The ruling was affirmed \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n by the Supreme Court of the state. The case is here on writ of error to that action.\n The bill in the case, as far as we are concerned with it, assails the act of 1921 as offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it denies to the Thomas Colliery Company, and other owners and operators of anthracite mines, the equal protection of the laws because it taxes such owners and anthracite coal, and does not tax the owners of bituminous mines and bituminous coal. The ultimate foundation of the contention is that anthracite coal and bituminous coal are fuels, and necessarily, therefore, must be associated in the same class for taxation, in disregard or in diminution of whatever other differences may exist between them in composition, qualities or uses, and that not to so associate them is arbitrary and unreasonable, having the consequences of inequality and illegality, and, therefore, within the ban of the Constitution of the United States.\n The contention, therefore, concerntrates attention upon the consideration of what resemblances or differences in objects justify their inclusion in, or their exclusion from, a particular class.\n It would be commonplace and wearisome to enlarge much upon the principle that presides in and determines the classification of objects. It is too necessary and too familiar in the affairs of life. We cannot go far in thought or practice without its exercise. It is the process of considering objects together or in separation as determined by their properties or some of them, and the purpose we have in hand. If the properties and purpose have relation, the process is logically justified.\n Illustrations readily occur. A farmer will classify plants differently from a botanist, but the classification of both may, notwithstanding the difference, be logically proper. \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 255]\n\u00a0\n And so classification has uses in government-indeed, we may say, necessities in government, for government as well as persons has purposes, varied and, at times, exigent, and its legislation must be accommodated to them, either in convenience or necessity. That government has the power to do so we have often pronounced, not, however, omitting to recognize the restraints upon the power while expressing its range and adaptation. In its exercise in taxation, we have said, it is competent for a state to exempt certain kinds of property and tax others, the restraints upon its only being against 'clear and hostile discriminations against particular persons and classes.' Discriminations merely are not inhibited, for, it was recognized that there are 'discriminations which the best interests of society require.' Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533.\n The principle of that case, and its concession to the power of a state, has received expression and illustration in cases which concerned the exercise of the power in the classification of objects for taxing purposes. In Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 U.S. 122\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 43, it is said:\n'Any classification is permissible which has a reasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action. ... It is enough, for instance, if the classification is reasonably founded in 'the purposes and policy of taxation.\"\n\n In other cases it is said that facts which can be reasonably conceived of as having existed when the law was enacted will be assumed to justify it. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160, Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129, 137\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 42.\n And 'it makes no difference that the facts may be disputed or their effect opposed by argument and opinion of serious strength. It is not within the competency of the courts to arbitrate in such contrariety.' Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis, \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455, and cases there cited.\n And, further, the purpose of the legislation may not be the correction of some \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 256]\n\u00a0\n definite evil, but may be only to remove 'obstacles to a greater public welfare.' See, also, as to classification by legislation and its consonance to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, District of Columbia v. Brooke, \n214 \nU.S. 138, 150\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 560.\n Is there a guide in these cases to decision, or is it to be found in the cases cited by the plaintiff in error which express the admonition and restraint that a classification to be justified must not be unreasonable or arbitrary? To answer, a comparison of the coals becomes necessary. In making it, the first fact we encounter is a difference in their names, and as names of things are considered significant of their attributes, the names, it may be assumed, announce a difference in attributes, and as dependent upon it, a difference in uses. Resemblances, however, are alleged in the bill and not denied in the answer, which, it is alleged, essentially assimilate the coals and make arbitrary the selection of one for taxation and not the other.\n The detail is interesting. It includes the description of the processes of nature in the formation of the coals, their particular properties, composition and appearances, and the localities of their production. Anthracite coal, it is said, is found only in 9 counties out of 67 in the state of Pennsylvania; bituminous coal in 24 counties. Both are sold, is the allegation, to places outside of the state and in competition for fuel purposes, and that the anthracite in certain sizes, termed steam sizes, competes with bituminous coal, and certain subgrades ( intermediate grades) of the latter with certain subgrades of anthracite.\n But we need not dwell further on these considerations. The fact of competition may be accepted. Both coals, being compositions of carbon, are, of course, capable of combustion and may be used as fuels, but under different conditions and manifestations, and the difference deter \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n mines a choice between them even as fuels. By disregarding that difference and the greater ones which exist, and by dwelling on competition alone, it is easy to erect an argument of strength against the taxation of one and not of the other. But this may not be done. The differences between them are a just basis for their different classification; and the differences are great and important. They differ even as fuels; they differ fundamentally in other particulars. Anthracite coal has no substantial use beyond a fuel; bituminous coal has other uses. Products of utility are obtained from it. The fact is not denied and the products are enumerated, and the extent of their use. \n1\n They are, therefore, incentives to industries that the state in natural policy might well hesitate to obstruct or burden, and to yield to the policy or consider it is well within the concession of the power of the state expressed in the cases we have cited. The distinction in the treatment of the respective coals being within the power conceded by the cases to the state, it has logical and legal justification and is, necessarily, not unreasonable or arbitrary. We concur, therefore, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the state sustaining the act of 1921\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n Anthracite coal, as we have observed, is asserted to be found in only nine counties in the state, and practically nowhere else in the United States. The fact, it is further said, gives the state a monopoly of it, and that a tax upon it is levying a tribute upon the consumption of other states, and nine of them have appeared by their Attorneys General to assail it as illegal and denounce it as an attempt to regulate interstate commerce. In emphasis of the contention, the Governor of the state is quoted as urging the tax because of that effect. The fact, tribute upon the consumers of the coal in other states, is pronounced inevitable, as, it is the assertion, 80 per cent. of the total production is shipped to other states, and that this constitutes its 'major 'market.\" And the dependency upon Pennsylvania is represented as impossible of evasion or relief. Anthracite coal, is the assertion, has become a prime necessity of those states, 'particularly for domestic purposes' and even 'municipal laws and ordinances have been passed forbidding the use of other coal for heating purposes.'\n The representation is graphic, but the first impression it makes is that it is in contradiction of the contention of the plaintiff in error that the tax discriminates against anthracite coal, for certainly there cannot be that complete competition and identity of use as a fuel between that coal and bituminous coal when there is such a difference between them as fuels that the use of one is enjoined by law and the other, in effect, prohibited.\n This However, only in passing. We will consider the contentions of the Attorneys General, independently of the contentions of plaintiff in error and assume that the antagonism, if existing, between the contentions, may in some way, not now appearing, have reconciliation.\n The contention that the tax is a regulation of interstate commerce seems to be based somewhat upon the declaration of the Governor of the state of its effect upon consumers \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 259]\n\u00a0\n in other states. We are unable to discern in the fact any materiality or pertinency, nor in the fact that Pennsylvania has a monopoly (if we may use the word) of the coal. Whether any statute or action of a state impinges upon interstate commerce depends upon the statute or action, not upon what is said about it or the motive which impelled it, and a tax upon articles in one state that are destined for use in another state cannot be called a regulation of interstate commerce whether imposed in the certainty of a return from a monopoly existing, or in the doubt and chances because of competition. The action of the state as a regulation of interstate commerce does not depend upon the degree of interference; it is illegal in any degree.\n We may, therefore, disregard the adventitious considerations referred to and their confusion, and by doing so we can estimate the contention made. It is that the products of a state that have, or are destined to have, a market in other states are subjects of interstate commerce, though they have not moved from the place of their production or preparation.\n The reach and consequences of the contention repels its acceptance. If the possibility, or indeed certainty, of exportation of a product or article from a state determines it to be in interstate commerce before the commencement of its movement from the state, it would seem to follow that it is in such commerce from the instant of its growth or production, and in the case of coals, as they lie in the ground. The result would be curious. It would nationalize all industries, it would nationalize and withdraw from state jurisdiction and deliver to federal commercial control the fruits of California and the South, the wheat of the West and its meats, the cotton of the South, the shoes of Massachusetts and the woolen industries of other states at the very inception of their production or \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 260]\n\u00a0\n growth, that is, the fruits unpicked, the cotton and wheat ungathered, hides and flesh of cattle yet 'on the hoof,' wool yet unshorn, and coal yet unmined because they are in varying percentages destined for and surely to be exported to states other than those of their production.\n However, we need not proceed further in speculation and argument. Ingenuity and imagination have been exercised heretofore upon a like contention. There is temptation to it in the relation of the states to the federal government, being yet superior to the states in instances or rather, having spheres of action exclusive of them. The instances cannot in all cases be precisely defined. And the uncertainty attracts disputes, and is availed of to assert or suppose collisions which, in fact, do not exist. There is illustration in the cases. In Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475, the precise contention here made was passed upon and rejected. It involved the taxing power of a state, and the property subject to it (timber cut in its forests) was intended for exportation and had progressed nearer to exportation than the coal in the present case.\n The question in the case was said to be:\n'Whether the products of a state (in this case timber cut in its forests) are liable to be taxed like other property within the state, though intended for exportation to another state, and partially prepared for that purpose by being deposited at a place of shipment, such products being owned by persons residing in another state.'\n\n And again:\n'Do the owner's state of mind in relation to the goods, that is, his intent to export them, and his partial preparation to do so, exempt them from taxation.'\n\n In answer to the questions, the point of time when goods case to be under power of the state and come under the protection of the Constitution was considered. To express it as the court did:\n'There must be a point of time when they [goods] cease to be governed exclusively by the domestic law and \n\n[260 U.S. 245, 261]\n\u00a0\n begin to be governed and protected by the national law of commercial regulation, and that moment seems to us to be a legitimate one for this purpose, in which they commence their final movement for transportation from the state of their origin to that of their destination.'\n\n And again:\n'Nor is exportation begun until they are committed to the common carrier for transportation out of the state to the state of their destination, or have started on their ultimate passage to that state.'\n\n Until then, it was said, they were a part of the general mass of property of the state, and subject to its jurisdiction.\n Other cases have decided the same and afford illustrations of it. Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 U.S. 418\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 383; Susquehanna Coal Co. v. South Amboy, \n228 U.S. 665\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 712; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 U.S. 211\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 475; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 U.S. 344\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 570.\n The effect of these cases is attempted to be evaded by the assertion that the statute in imposing the tax when the coal \"is ready for shipment or market' is a plain and intentional fraud upon the commerce clause.' We cannot accept the accusation as justified, or that the situation of the coal can be changed by it and as moving in interstate commerce when it is plainly not so moving. The coal, therefore, is too definitely situated to be misunderstood and the cases cited to establish a different character and subjection need not be reviewed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The differences of the coals and their respective uses were found by the court of common pleas and the Supreme Court. One of the findings is as follows: 'We find that anthracite coal differs from bituminous coal in its physical coal differs from the amount of fixed carbon, the amount of volatile matter, color, luster, and structural character. The percentage of fixed carbon in anthracite is much higher and the percentage of volatile matter much lower than in bituminous coal. Anthracite coal is hard, compact, and comparatively clean and free from dust, while bituminous coal is softer, dusty and dirty.' The court also observed that it was persuasive of the difference between the coals that the Congress of the United States and the Canadian Parliament in levying import taxes put the coals in different classes, and that the railroads of Pennsylvania so separated them, and that, therefore, quoting another, the classification was 'one which actually exists in the business world.' \n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHILL v. WALLACE(1922)\nNo. 616\nArgued: January 11, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n This is a suit attacking the validity of the Future Trading Act, approved August 24, 1921. 42 Stat. 187, c. 86. The act imposes a tax of 20 cents a bushel on all contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery, but excepts from its application sales on boards of trade designated as contract markets by the Secretary of Agriculture, on fulfillment by such boards of certain conditions and requirements set forth in the act.\n The bill is filed by eight members of the Board of Trade of the city of Chicago, who sue in behalf of all other members of that body who may wish to join and share in the relief granted, against the Secretary of Agriculture, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the United States district attorney for the Northern district of Illinois, the collector of internal revenue for the First District of that state, the Board of Trade of the city of Chicago, its president, vice presidents, and directors. The bill avers that the appellants applied to the directors of the Board of Trade to institute a suit to have the Future Trading Act adjudged unconstitutional before they should comply with \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n it, but the board of directors refused to take any steps, and announced that they intended to comply with the provisions of the act; that the board refused because they feared to antagonize the public officials whose duty it was to construe and enforce the act, and the complainants feared that, acting under the coercion imposed upon them by the act, the board of directors would admit to membership on the board the representatives of the co-operative associations of producers; that the Secretary of Agriculture would designate such board as a contract market, and that such action by the board of directors would cause irreparable injury to the complainants and all the other members of the board. Complainants set out the character of the Board of Trade of Chicago and its organization as a corporation under a special charter of the state of Illinois in 1859, of which certain persons engaged in the purchase and sale of grain were created a corporation and given power to admit members, and expel them, to adopt regulations and by-laws for the management of the business and the mode in which it should be transacted; to appoint committees of arbitration for the settlement of differences between the members; to appoint persons to examine, measure, weigh, gauge, inspect grain and other articles of produce, with authority to issue a certificate as to quality or quantity; to make the brand or mark thereof evidence between any buyer and seller assenting to the employment of such person; and to do and carry on business usual in the management of boards of trade.\n The bill avers that the board has 1,610 members, of whom the complainants are members in good standing; that its memberships are salable for more than $7,000 apiece; that in recent years there have been organized in most of the grain-producing states, among so-called farmers, co-operative societies who desire to market their crops at actual cost, and to market them through the exchanges \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n at actual cost, and without paying the commissions charged by the members of such exchange, the plan being to sell all grain through an authorized member of such organization admitted to the exchange who shall charge the prescribed commission and ultimately rebate back to the members of such organization the aggregate of such commissioners after paying his salary and incidental expenses, on the basis of the number of bushels of grain which each producer has sold through said organization; that the admission of such representatives of co-operative societies to the Chicago Board of Trade would destroy the business of its members, and the value of the memberships, and make it difficult for the board to maintain sufficient members to pay the assessments to meet the expenses of its maintenance; that many of its members engage in making contracts with other members for the purchase and sale of grain for future delivery; that during the years from 1884 to 1913, wheat of the grade contemplated in the contracts for future delivery on the board sold as low as 48 7\/8 cents per bushel, and never for more than $2 per bushel; and that during most of said time its price was below $1; that during the same years corn sold as low as 19 1\/2 cents a bushel, and never higher than $1, and most of the time sold below 60 cents; that oats sold as low as 14 3\/4 cents per bushel and never higher than 62 1\/2 cents, and much the greater part of said period under 40 cents per bushel; that at the time of the filing of the bill, contract wheat was selling for $1.05 per bushel, and that no member of the board could afford to make contracts for future delivery and pay the tax thereon imposed by the Future Trading Act of 20 cents a bushel; that the law in effect prohibits all those who are not members of a board of trade, which has been designated by the Secretary of Agriculture a contract market under said act, from making any contracts of sales for future delivery. \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 48]\n\u00a0\n The bill charges that the Future Trading Act violates the Constitution of the United States (1) in depriving the members of the board of their property without due process of law, in the compulsory admission to membership on said board of representatives of the co- operative associations of producers, in accord with section 5 of the act; ( 2) in that it attempts to regulate commerce, which is not commerce with foreign governments or among several states, but is commerce wholly between persons contracting within the state of Illinois respecting the purchase or sale of grain which forms a part of the common property of that state, and is intrastate and not interstate; (3) in that it violates the Tenth Amendment to the constitution, by interfering with the right of the state of Illinois to provide for and regulate the maintenance of grain exchanges within its borders upon which is conducted the making of contracts which are merely intrastate transactions.\n The bill avers the complainants are not in collusion with defendants or any of them to confer on a court of the United States jurisdiction of a cause of which it would not otherwise have jurisdiction, and that the amount involved in the matters in dispute is, exclusive of interest and costs, more than $3,000.\n The decrees prayed for are:\n To enjoin the Secretary of Agriculture from taking any steps to induce or compel the Board of Trade or its directors to comply with the provisions of the act;\n To enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the collector of internal revenue and the district attorney named as parties from attempting to collect by suits or prosecutions or otherwise, any tax, penalty, or fine, under the act; and\n To enjoin the Board of Trade and each of its officers and directors from applying to the Secretary of Agriculture to have the board designated as a contract market \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 49]\n\u00a0\n under the act, and from admitting to membership into such board any representative or any co-operative association of producers in compliance with section 5 of the act, or from taking any other steps to comply with the act.\n The Board of Trade and its president, its officers, and directors moved to dismiss the bill of complaint on the ground that it was without equity on its face and did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in a court of equity.\n The Secretary of Agriculture appeared specially to move the court to dismiss the suit as to him, because he was not a resident of the Northern district of Illinois and had not been served with process, and the court had no jurisdiction over him.\n The United States attorney for the Northern district of Illinois, and the collector of internal revenue, moved the court to dismiss on the grounds that the suit was to restrain the collection of a tax contrary to section 3224 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5947), and that the bill sought to restrain the enforcement of a criminal statute without showing that the complainants suffered irreparable injury. The District Court denied the motion for a temporary injunction and ordered that the bill be dismissed as to all the defendants for want of equity.\n Mr. Henry S. Robbins, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 44, 56]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 44, 60]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after making the foregoing statement of the case, delivered the opinion of the court.\n The first question for our consideration is whether, assuming the act to be invalid, the complainants on the \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 61]\n\u00a0\n face of their bill state sufficient equitable grounds to justify granting the relief they ask. We think it clear that within the cases of Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., \n255 U.S. 180\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 243, Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673, and Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 341, 346, the averments of the bill entitle them to relief against the Board of Trade of Chicago, its president and its directors. The bill shows that the act, if enforced, will seriously injure the value of the Board of Trade to its members, and the pecuniary value of their memberships. If the law be unconstitutional then, it was the duty of the board of directors to bring an action to resist its enforcement. It is quite like the case of Dodge v. Woolsey, in which the court said with respect to a similar refusal:\n'Now, in our view the refusal upon the part of the directors by their own showing partakes more of disregard of duty than of an error of judgment. It was a nonperformance of a confessed official obligation amounting to what the law considers a breach of trust, though it may not involve intentional moral delinquency. It was a mistake, it is true, of what their duty required from them, according to their own sense of it, but, being a duty by their own confession, their refusal was an act outside of the obligation which the charter imposed upon them to protect what they conscientiously believed to be the franchises of the bank. A sense of duty and conduct contrary to it, is not 'an error of judgment merely,' and cannot be so called in any case.'\n\n The averments of the bill are that the board of directors refused the request to bring the suit because they feared to antagonize the public officials whose duty it was to construe and enforce the act, and not because they thought the act was constitutional. They must be taken to have admitted this by the motion to dismiss. \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 62]\n\u00a0\n In Wathen v. Jackson Oil Co., \n235 U.S. 635\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 225, and in Corbus v. Gold Mining Co., \n187 U.S. 455\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 157, thought to cast doubt upon the sufficiency of the averments made herein to sustain complaints' right to file the bill, there had been no request made of the corporation or the board of directors to bring suit and no refusal, both of which are present in the case at bar.\n A further question arises as to whether this is a suit for an injunction against the collection of the tax in violation of section 3224, R. S., in so far as it seeks relief against the district attorney and collector of internal revenue. Were this a state act, injunction would certainly issue against such officers under the decisions in Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 587\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 372; McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 82\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 498. Does section 3224, R. S., prevent the application of similar principles to a federal taxing act? It has been held by this court, in Dodge v. Brady, \n240 \nU.S. 122, 126\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 277, that section 3224 of the Revised Statutes does not prevent an injunction in a case apparently within its terms in which some extraordinary and entirely exceptional circumstances make its provisions inapplicable. See, also, Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 \nU.S. 118, 122\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 275. In the case before us, a sale of grain for future delivery without paying the tax will subject one to heavy criminal penalties. To pay the heavy tax on each of many daily transactions which occur in the ordinary business of a member of the exchange, and then sue to recover it back would necessitate a multiplicity of suits, and, indeed, would be impracticable. For the Board of Trade to refuse to apply for designation as a contract market in order to test the validity of the act would stop its 1,600 members in a branch of their business most important to themselves and to the country. We think these exceptional and extraordinary circumstances with respect to the operation of this act make section 3224 inapplicable. The right to sue for an injunction against the \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 63]\n\u00a0\n taxing officials is not, however, necessary to give us jurisdiction. If they were to be dismissed under section 3224, the bill would still raise the question here mooted against the Board of Trade and its directors. The Solicitor General has appeared on behalf of the government and argued the case in full on all the issues. Our conclusion as to the validity of the act will, therefore, have the same effect as did the judgment of the court in respect to the income tax law in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673, to which the government was not a party, but in which the Attorney General on its behalf was heard as amicus curiae.\n The act whose constitutionality is attacked is entitled:\n'An act taxing contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery, and options for such contracts, and providing for the regulation of boards of trade, and other purposes.' (Italics ours.)\n\n Section 4 imposes a tax, in addition to any imposed by law, of 20 cents a bushel involved in every contract of sale of grain for future delivery, with two exceptions. The first exception is where the seller holds and owns the grain at the time of sale, or is the owner or renter of land on which the grain is to be grown, or is an association made of such owners or renters. The second exception is where such contracts are made by or through a member of the Board of Trade designated by the Secretary of Agriculture as a contract market, and are evidenced by a memorandum containing certain particulars, to be kept for a period of three years or as much longer as the Secretary of Agriculture shall direct, and to be open to official inspection. This tax on sale contracts for future delivery is in addition to a tax now imposed by the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919 (40 Stat. 1057, 1136, title XI, Schedule A [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6318p]), of 2 cents on every $100 in value of such sales.\n Section 5 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to designate boards of trade as contract markets when and \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 64]\n\u00a0\n only when such boards comply with certain conditions and requirements, as follows:\n\n\n (a)\n When located at a terminal market where cash grain is sold in sufficient amount and under such conditions as to reflect the value of the grain in its different grades, and where there is recognized official weighing and inspection service.\n\n\n (b)\n When the governing body of the board adopts rules and enforces them, requiring its members to make and keep the memorandum of all transactions in grain, whether cash or for future delivery, as directed by the Secretary.\n\n\n (c)\n When the governing body prevents the dissemination by the board or any member thereof of false misleading, or inaccurate report, concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of commodities.\n\n\n (d)\n When the governing board provides for the prevention of manipulation of prices, or the cornering of any grain by the dealers or operators upon such board.\n\n\n (e)\n When the governing body admits to membership on the board and all its privileges any authorized representative of any lawfully formed and conducted co-operative associations of producers having adequate financial responsibility:\n'Provided, that no rule of the contract market against rebating commissions shall apply to the distribution of earnings among bona fide members of any such associations.'\n\n\n (f)\n When the governing body of the board shall make effective the orders and decisions of the commission appointed under section 6.\n Section 6 provides that any board of trade desiring to be designated as a contract market shall apply to the Secretary of Agriculture, with a showing that it complies with the conditions already stipulated in section 5, and a sufficient assurance of future compliance. The section appoints \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 65]\n\u00a0\n a commission of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General, who may, after due notice to the officers of the board, suspend for six months or revoke the designation of any board as a contract market upon a showing of failure to comply with the requirements of section 5.\n Provisions are made for an appeal from this order to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and appeal is granted to the commission from the refusal of the Secretary of Agriculture, upon application, to designate any board as a contract market.\n Section 6 also provides that if the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that any person is violating any provisions of the act or is attempting to manipulate the market price of grain in violation of the provisions of section 5, or any of the rules or regulations made pursuant to its requirements, he may have served upon such persons a complaint for a hearing before a referee, to take evidence, to be transmitted to the Secretary as chairman of the commission, and the commission may, after a finding of guilt, issue an order requiring all contract markets to refuse such person trade or privileges. This order may be revised in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Section 7 provides that the tax imposed shall be paid by the seller and shall be collected either by affixing stamps or by such other method as may be prescribed by the published regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury.\n Section 10 provides a penalty for any person who shall fail to evidence the contract of sale he makes by memorandum or to keep the record of it, or to pay the tax as provided in sections 4 and 5, with a penalty of 50 per cent. of the tax and a punishment as a misdemeanor and a fine of $ 10,000, with imprisonment for one year or both and the costs of the prosecution.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 44, 66]\n\u00a0\n It is impossible to escape the conviction, from a full reading of this law, that it was enacted for the purpose of regulating the conduct of business of Boards of Trade through supervision of the Secertary of Agriculture and the use of an administrative tribunal consisting of that Secertary, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General. Indeed the title of the act recites that one of its purposes is the regulation of Boards of Trade. As the bill shows, the imposition of 20 cents a bushel on the various grains affected by the tax is most burdensome. The tax upon contracts for sales for future delivery under the Revenue Act is only 2 cents upon $100 of value, whereas this tax varies according to the price and character of the grain from 15 per cent. of its value to 50 per cent. The manifest purpose of the tax is to compel Boards of Trade to comply with regulations, many of which can have no relevancy to the collection of the tax at all. Even if we conceded, as we do not, that the keeping of a memorandum and of the particulars of each sale as a record for three years or more, not only of contracts for future delivery, but also of cash sales, neither of which are subject to tax in designated Boards of Trade, would help taxing officers in any way to detect the evasions of this tax outside of such boards, no such construction can be put upon the provisions which require the Board of Trade to prevent a dissemination of false or misleading reports or to prevent the manipulation of prices or the cornering of grain or which enforce the admission to membership in the board of the representatives of co-operative associations of producers or the abrogation of rules against rebate as applied to such representatives. The act is in essence and on its face a complete regulation of Boards of Trade, with a penalty of 20 cents a bushel on all 'futures' to coerce Boards of Trade and their members into compliance. When this purpose is declared in the title to the bill, and is so clear from the effect of the provisions \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 67]\n\u00a0\n of the bill itself, it leaves no ground upon which the provisions we have been considering can be sustained as a valid exercise of the taxing power. The elaborate machinery for hearings by the Secretary of Agriculture and by the commission of violations of these regulations with the withdrawal by the commission of the designation of the board as a contract market and of complaints against persons who violate the act or such regulations and the imposition upon them of the penalty of requiring all Boards of Trade to refuse to permit them the usual privileges, only confirm this view.\n Our decision, just announced, in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n259 U.S. 20\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 449, 66 L. Ed. --, involving the constitutional validity of the Child Labor Tax Law, completely covers this case. We there distinguish between cases like Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, and McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561, in which it was held that this court could not limit the discretion of Congress in the exercise of its constitutional powers to levy excise taxes because the court might deem the incidence of the tax oppressive or even destructive. It was pointed out that in none of those cases did the law objected to show on its face, as did the Child Labor Tax Law, detailed regulation of a concern or business wholly within the police power of the state, with a heavy exaction to promote the efficacy of such regulation. We there say:\n'Out of a proper respect for the acts of a coordinate branch of the government, this court has gone far to sustain taxing acts as such, even though there has been ground for suspecting from the weight of the tax, it was intended to destroy its subject. But in the act before us the presumption of validity cannot prevail, because the proof of the contrary is found on the very face of its provisions. Grant the validity of this law, and all that Congress would need to do, hereafter, in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number of subjects of \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 68]\n\u00a0\n public interest, jurisdiction of which the states have never parted with, and which are reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment, would be to enact a detailed measure of complete regulation of the subject and enforce it by a so-called tax upon departures from it. To give such magic to the word 'tax' would be to break down all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congress and completely wipe out the sovereignty of the states.'\n\n This has complete application to the act before us, and requires us to hold that the provisions of the act we have been discussing cannot be sustained as an exercise of the taxing power of Congress conferred by section 8, article 1.\n We come to the question then: Can these regulations of boards of trade by Congress be sustained under the commerce clause of the Constitution? Such regulations are held to be within the police powers of the state. House v. Mayes, \n219 U.S. 270\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 234; Broadnax v. Missouri, \n219 U.S. 285\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 238. There is not a word in the act from which it can be gathered that it is confined in its operation to interstate commerce. The words 'interstate commerce' are not to be found in any part of the act from the title to the closing section. The transactions upon which the tax is to be imposed, the bill avers, are sales made between members of the Board of Trade in the city of Chicago for future delivery of grain, which will be settled by the process of offsetting purchases or by a delivery of warehouse receipts of grain stored in Chicago. Looked at in this aspect, and without any limitation of the application of the tax to interstate commerce, or to that which the Congress may deem from evidence before it to be an obstruction to interstate commerce, we do not find it possible to sustain the validity of the regulations as they are set forth in this act. A reading of the act makes it quite clear that Congress sought to use the taxing power to give validity to the act. It did not have the exercise of its power under the commerce clause in mind, and so did not \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 69]\n\u00a0\n introduce into the act the limitations which certainly would accompany and mark an exercise of the power under the latter clause.\n In Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 526, 14 Ann. Cas. 1031, it was held that contracts for the sales of cotton for future delivery which do not oblige interstate shipments are not subjects of interstate commerce, and that a state tax on persons engaged in buying and selling cotton for future delivery was held not to be a regulation of interstate commerce or beyond the power of the state.\n It follows that sales for future delivery on the Board of Trade are not in and of themselves interstate commerce. They cannot come within the regulatory power of Congress as such, unless they are regarded by Congress, from the evidence before it, as directly interfering with interstate commerce so as to be an obstruction or a burden thereon. United States v. Ferger, \n250 U.S. 199\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 445. It was upon this principle that in Stafford et al. v. Wallace et al., \n258 U.S. 495\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 397, 66 L. Ed. --, decided May 1, 1922, we held it to be within the power of Congress to regulate business in the stockyards of the country, and include therein the regulation of commission men and of traders there, although they had to do only with sales completed and ended within the yards, because Congress had concluded that through exorbitant charges, dishonest practices, and collusion they were likely, unless regulated, to impose a direct burden on the interstate commerce passing through.\n So, too, in United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325, it was held that, though this court, as we have seen, had decided in the Ware & Leland Case that mere contracts for sales of cotton for future delivery which did not oblige interstate shipments were not interstate commerce, an indictment charging the defendants with having cornered the whole cotton market of the United States by excessive purchases of cotton for future delivery and thus conspired to restrain, obstruct and monopolize interstate \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 70]\n\u00a0\n commerce in cotton, was sustained under the first and second sections of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law (Comp. St.  8820, 8821). This case, like Stafford v. Wallace, followed the principles of Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276. But the form and limitations of the act before us form no such basis as those cases presented for federal jurisdiction and the exercise of the power to protect interstate commerce. Our conclusion makes it necessary for us to hold section 4, and those parts of the act which are regulations affected by the socalled tax imposed by section 4, to be unenforceable.\n Section 11 of this act directs that--\n'If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the act and of the application of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.'\n\n Section 4 with its penalty to secure compliance with the regulations of Boards of Trade is so interwoven with those regulations that they cannot be separated. None of them can stand. Section 11 did not intend the court to dissect an unconstitutional measure and reframe a valid one out of it by inserting limitations it does not contain. This is legislative work beyond the power and function of the court. In United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 221 (23 L. Ed. 563), presenting a similar question as to a criminal statute, Chief Justice Waite said:\n'We are not able to reject a part which is unconstitutional, and retain the remainder, because it is not possible to separate that which is unconstitutional, if there be any such, from that which is not. The proposed effect is not to be attained by striking out or disregarding words that are in the section, but by inserting those that are not now there. Each of the sections must stand as a whole, or fall altogether. The language is plain. There is no room for construction, unless it be as to the effect of the Constitution. The question, then, to be determined, \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 71]\n\u00a0\n is whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only . ... To limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is no part of our duty.'\n\n Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n; Butts v. Merchants Transportation Co., \n230 U.S. 126\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 964\n\n\n To be sure in the cases cited there was no saving provision like section 11, and undoubtedly such a provision furnishes assurance to courts that they may properly sustain separate sections or provisions of a partly invalid act without hesitation or doubt as to whether they would have been adopted, even if the Legislature had been advised of the invalidity of part. But it does not give the court power to amend the act.\n There are sections of the act to which under section 11 the reasons for our conclusion as to section 4 and the interwoven regulations do not apply. Such is section 9 authorizing investigations by the Secretary of Agriculture and his publication of results. Section 3, too, would not seem to be affected by our conclusion. It provides:\n'That in addition to the taxes now imposed by law there is hereby levied a tax amounting to 20 cents per bushel on each bushel involved therein, whether the actual commodity is intended to be delivered or only nominally referred to, upon each and every privilege or option for a contract either of purchase or sale of grain, intending hereby to tax only the transactions known to the trade as 'privileges,' 'bids,' 'offers,' 'puts and calls,' 'indemnities,' or 'ups and downs.\"\n\n This is the imposition of an excise tax upon certain transactions of a unilateral character in grain markets which approximate gambling or offer full opportunity for it and does not seem to be associated with section 4. Such a tax without more would seem to be within the congressional \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 72]\n\u00a0\n power. Treat v. White, \n187 U.S. 264\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 611; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 U.S. 509\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 522; Thomas v. United States, \n192 U.S. 363\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 305. But these are questions which are not before us and upon which we wish to express no definite opinion.\n The injunction against the Board of Trade and its officers, and the injunction against the collector of internal revenue and the district attorney, should be granted, so far as section 4 is concerned and the regulations of the act interwoven within it. The court below acquired no personal jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by proper service and the dismissal as to them was right.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDELS concurring.\n I agree that the Future Trading Act is unconstitutional; but I doubt whether the plaintiffs are in a position to require the court to pass upon the constitutional question in this case. It seems proper to state the reasons for my doubt.\n In essence this is a suit by eight members of the Chicago Board of Trade to prevent its directors and officers from accepting the offer of the government to designate it a 'contract market.' The act does not require the corporation to become a 'contract market.' If-and only if-it elects to become such, must its rules, and the conduct of its business, conform to requirements prescribed by the act of the Secretary of Agriculture. In that event its members may likewise be subjected individually to some slight additional trouble and expense; for the Secretary of Agriculture may require a more detailed record of transactions than is ordinarily kept and may require that the records be preserved three years. Members may, in that event, also suffer individually some loss of business \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 73]\n\u00a0\n through the competition of representatives of producers' co-operative organizations, who wre to be admitted to the privileges of the exchange if it becomes a 'contract market.' On the other hand, by acceptance of the designation as a 'contract market' members of the Board of Trade would be relieved from all danger of liability for taxes on their future trading; and if the act is enforced generally, the profits of the individual members may increase largely, because the general public, being debarred by the act from gambling on futures in bucket shops, will naturally turn to the few 'contract markets' when desiring to speculate in futures.\n To decide whether the corporation and its members will be benefited or injured by its becoming a 'contract market' is a matter calling for the exercise of business judgment. The charter vests in the directors and managers broad powers; and, so far as appears, there is nothing in the by- laws or in the nature of the action proposed which prevents their exercising freely their judgment in this, as in other matters affecting the business. No radical or fundamental change in the object, character, or methods of the business of the corporation or of its members is involved. There is no allegation that the directors and managing officers are incapacitated from acting because their interests are adverse to the corporation or its members, or that their action should be interfered with because they are purposing to exercise their powers fraudulently or otherwise in violation of their trust. Nor is it alleged that efforts have been made to control their action by calling a meeting of the 1,600 members or that such efforts would be vain, or that there is an emergency requiring interposition of a court of equity. The requirements of equity rule 27 (33 Sup. Ct. xxv) are not complied with by alleging simply that plaintiffs requested the board of directors 'to institute a suit to have said Future Trading Act adjudged unconstitutional,' and that the plaintiffs 'are informed and \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 74]\n\u00a0\n believe that said board of directors refused said request because they fear to antagonize the public officials whose duty it is to construe and enforce said act.'\n That under such circumstances a stockholder's bill is fatally defective, although it was brought to restrain the enforcement of a statute alleged to be unconstitutional, is well settled; and the rule has been recently applied. Wathen v. Jackson Oil & Refining Co., \n235 U.S. 635\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 225; Corbus v. Gold Mining Co., \n187 U.S. 455\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 157. In the case at bar, plaintiffs' case is still weaker than it was in those cited. For aught that appears, most of the members of the exchange, as well as its directors and managing officers, may be of opinion that they will be benefited by the enforcement of the act. Nothing is better settled than that an individual may acquiesce in or waive an admitted infringement of a constitutional right; and I am not aware of any rule of law which requires a corporation, upon request of a minority stockholder, to play the knight-errant and tilt at every statute affecting it which he believes to be invalid. A corporation, like an individual, may refrain from embarking in litigation to enforce even a clear right of action, if litigation is deemed inadvisable; and it is immaterial, in this respect, whether the right of action arises at common law or under a statute or under a constitutional provision. Nor do I know of any reason why the disadvantages which may flow from 'antagonizing public officials' may not properly be considered by directors and managing officers of a corporation in determining whether to embark in litigation. The fear of antagonizing customers or other business connections or the public is a motive which quite commonly and properly influences the conduct of men.\n If, after the corporation has become a 'contract market,' its directors and managing officers should seek to subject the plaintiffs as members to unauthorized restrictions, or should attempt to deprive them of vested rights, \n\n[259 U.S. 44, 75]\n\u00a0\n relief may, of course, be had in a proper proceeding. And likewise, if the plaintiffs now have, as individuals, rights entitled to protection, there are appropriate remedies. But this is not such a suit. Here members of a corporation seek to enforce alleged derivative rights; and I doubt whether they have shown that they are in a position to do so. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOWAT v. STATE OF KANSAS(1922)\nNo. 154\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 181, 182]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Redmond S. Brennan, of Kansas City, Mo., and John F. McCarron, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Richard J. Hopkins, Atty. Gen., John G. Egan, Asst. Atty. Gen ., Baxter D. McClain, of Topeka, Kan., Moorfield Storey, Harold S. Davis, of Boston, Mass., and F. Dumont Smith, of Hutchinson, Kan., for the State of Kansas.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two writs of error to the Supreme Court of Kansas sued out ( section 237, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1214]), with the hope and purpose of testing the validity, under the federal Constitution, \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n of the act of the Legislature of Kansas creating a Court of Industrial Relations. Chapter 29, Special Session Laws of Kansas of 1920\n\n\n In No. 154, the plaintiffs in error were defendants in proceedings taken in the district court of Crawford county, Kan., to compel them to attend and give testimony under subpoena before the court of industrial relations. They had refused to appear. After arrest and a hearing, they were sentenced to confinement in jail until they should comply with the order. State ex rel. v. Howat, 107 Kan. 423, 191 Pac. 585.\n In No. 491, the plaintiffs in error were sentenced to imprisonment for a year as punishment for violation of an injunction issued by the same district court forbidding them to call or cause a strike among the employees in certain coal mines in Crawford county. State v. Howat, 109 Kan. 376, 198 Pac. 686.\n We are of opinion that in neither case is the Kansas Industrial Relations Act presented in such way as to permit us to pass upon those features which are attacked by the plaintiffs in error as violative of the Constitution of the United States.\n The main purpose of the act is to create an administrative tribunal to arbitrate controversies between employers and employees in certain industrial, mining, and transportation businesses which the act declares to be affected with such a public interest that their continuity is essential to the public peace, the public health, and the proper living conditions and general welfare of the people. The board, miscalled a court, is given power to make investigations on its own initiative or upon complaint of interested persons to consider the wages, the return to capital, and the conditions surrounding the workers in any such employment and business, to summon all necessary parties in interest, to call and examine witnesses, and, after hearing, to make its findings and orders stating specifically \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n the terms and conditions, including wages, upon which such industry or employment shall be carried on in the future. In case the parties do not obey the orders the board is given authority to apply to the Supreme Court of Kansas to compel compliance, and the Supreme Court is authorized to review the orders upon the evidence already heard, and such other new evidence as that court shall permit, and enter and enforce a proper judgment. The board is also authorized, with the consent of the Governor, to make general investigations into industrial and economic conditions to familiarize itself with industrial problems as they may arise. In effect, the act provides for compulsory arbitration between labor and capital in certain industries and employment. It forbids an injunction against a workman or employee to prevent his quitting his employment. It is directed against strikes and lockouts and their declared wasteful and destructive effect, and conspiracies, picketing, and intimidation to induce them. Obviously we should not pass upon the constitutional validity of an act presenting such critical and important issues unless the case before us requires it.\n In No. 154, Howat and the other plaintiffs in error were subpoenaed to appear before the so-called court of industrial relations to testify in an investigation into conditions existing in the mining industry in Cherokee and Crawford counties. They failed to appear. The powers of the tribunal in such a case are set forth in section 11 of the act reading in part as follows:\n'Said court ... shall have the power and authority to issue summons and subpoenas andcompel the attendance of witnesses and parties ... and to make any and all investigations necessary to ascertain the truth in regard to said controversy. In case any person shall fail or refuse to obey any summons or subpoena issued by said court after due service then and in that event said court is hereby authorized or empowered to take proper \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel obedience to such summons or subpoena.'\n\n Under this section, the board made application to the district court of Crawford county, the court of first instance of general jurisdiction in that county, to issue an order directing the plaintiffs in error to attend the board and testify. This order was issued, duly served and disobeyed. The contemnors were then brought into court by attachment. Their plea that the legislation under which they were subpoenaed was void was held to be insufficient and they were committed to jail until they should comply with the subpoena. The contemnors appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, which affirmed the action of the district court, holding that, without regard to the validity of the particular provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of which they complained, they were under legal obligation to obey the subpoena and were in contempt for not doing so. The court invited attention to section 28 of the act which provides that:\n'If any section or provision of this act shall be found invalid by any court, it shall be conclusively presumed that this act would have been passed by the Legislature without such invalid section or provision, and the act as a whole shall not be declared invalid by reason of the fact that one or more sections or provisions may be found to be invalid by any court'\n\n -and pointed out that even if the compulsory features of the act, to the constitutionality of which the plaintiff objected were invalid, there still remained in the act provision for investigation and findings by the industrial relations court, in respect to which the power of the Legislature was indisputable and in furthereance of which the machinery for compelling the attendance and testimony of witnesses was appropriate. The court relied on the decision of this court in respect to a similar provision in the Interstate Commerce Law in which the Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 186]\n\u00a0\n to secure attendance of witnesses at any investigation by it, through a proceeding before a Circuit Court of the United States. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 489 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 1125. It would seem to be sustained also by the decision of this court in Blair v. United States, \n250 U.S. 273\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 468, wherein it was held that a witness summoned to give testimony before a grand jury in the District Court of the United States was not entitled to refuse to testify, when ordered by the court to do so, upon the plea that the court and jury were without jurisdiction over the supposed offense under investigation because the statute denouncing the offense was unconstitutional.\n But even if we did not agree with the state court on this point, what we have said shows that the case was decided and disposed of by that court without any consideration of the application of the federal Constitution to the features of the Kansas statute of which complaint is made. Even if those features are void, these contempt proceedings the state court sustains of general law. We can not, therefore, consider for federal questions mooted and assigned for error. Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 610\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A (N. S.) 901; Leathe v. Thomas, \n207 \nU.S. 93, 98\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 30; Giles v. Teasley, \n193 \nU.S. 146, 160\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 359; Hopkins v. McLure, \n133 \nU.S. 380, 386\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 407; Hale v. Akers, \n132 \nU.S. 554, 564\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 171.\n In No. 491 the state of Kansas on the relation of its Attorney General and the county attorney of Crawford county, filed a petition in the district court of Crawford county, asking an injunction against Howat and others, 150 in number, members of local unions of the United Mine Workers of America, District No. 14. The petition averred that defendants were conspiring, threatening, and about to direct the officers to call a general strike in the coal mines of Crawford, Cherokee and Osage counties, Kansas, and cause a cessation of work in them, thereby endangering the peace and order of the communities in which said mines were located with intent \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n to violate the laws of Kansas and particularly the Court of Industrial Relations Act; that in pursuance thereof they were intimidating their coworkers and other employees of the operators of the mines, that the purpose of the conspiracy was to stop the operation of the railroads, and of the buildings, institutions, and industries of the state in the conduct of its government affairs and to cut off the supply of coal for household and other uses throughout the state; that all of said acts would seriously affect and injure the public welfare and the public health of the people; that a similar conspiracy a year before had been carried out, resulting in great suffering and loss to the people, and endangered their lives and health to such a degree that the state authorities were compelled to take possession of the mines and operate the same; and that in the light of this result the present conspiracy was being set on foot. The petition further averred that this conspiracy was directed especially to a nullification of the statute creating the court of industrial relations and its purposes. It was alleged that the plaintiff was without adequate remedy at law, and that irreparable loss and injury to the state and the people thereof would ensue unless the conspiracy of defendants was enjoined. The defendants pleaded in answer to these charges that:\n'Whatever cessation of work or intent to cease work there may have been, was solely and only in the exercise of their lawful rights, for the purpose of improving their working conditions and increasing their wages; and whatever effect their ceasing work may have had upon the production of coal, was incidental to and in the exercise of their legal and constitutional rights; and the stoppage in the operation of the production of coal, if any, was not the primary purpose, but merely the incidental effect incident to the exercise of their lawful rights.'\n\n They further alleged that the Industrial Court Act was void because in violation of the federal Constitution and the \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 188]\n\u00a0\n rights of defendants thereunder, and so the court was without power to issue an injunction, as prayed.\n The case came on for hearing, the state introduced evidence, and the defendants demurred to the evidence. The demurrer was overruled. The defendants declined to introduce evidence and rested. The court found the averments of the petition true and made permanent the temporary injunction already awarded. By this, the defendants were enjoined--\n'from directing, ordering or in any manner bringing about the hindering, delaying, interference with, or suspension of the operation, of any coal mines in the counties of Crawford, Cherokee or Osage, in the state of Kansas, and of the mining of coal at any of said mines, and from causing the miners and members of said labor union to quit their work at said mines for the purpose or purposes of hindering, delaying, interfering with or suspending the operation of any coal mines in said counties, and from intimidating by threats, abuse, or in any other manner, any person or persons with intent to induce such person or persons from accepting employment or remaining in employment at said mines, and from in any way whatsoever carrying out any conspiracy for the execution of any of said purposes.'\n\n In other clauses of the injunction, defendants are enjoined from maintaining and carrying on a conspiracy with the intent to evade the provisions of the Industrial Court Act, and to prevent persons from appearing before it by picketing or otherwise. The order expressly excluded from its purpose and effect the enjoining of any person against quitting his employment. Thereafter the Attorney General filed an affidavit charging that the defendants had violated the injunction by combining to order and compel a strike at two mines in Crawford county. At a hearing at which defendants were represented by counsel, the court found reasonable ground for believing that those of defendants who are plaintiffs in error here had violated \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 189]\n\u00a0\n the injunction. They were arrested and brought before the court, whereupon the court directed the filing of a formal accusation of contempt against them. The defendants answered attacking the validity of the Industrial Court Act and of the permanent injunction, averring that they had not done anything unlawful, and denying that the accusation stated facts sufficient to constitute a violation of the injunction. The court found that the averments of the accusation were sustained, that defendants had directed the strike at the mines in question, that a cessation of work ensued, that it was done willfully, in disobedience to the injunction, and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for a year and to payment of the costs and confinement till the costs were paid.\n On appeal, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the district court, a constitutional court of general jurisdiction (Constitution of Kansas,  6, art. 3; General Statutes of Kansas 1915,  2957), had general power to issue injunctions in equity, and that even if its exercise of the power was erroneous, that the injunction was not void, and the defendants were precluded from attacking it in this collateral proceeding, that aside from the Industrial Court Act, the district court had power in this case to issue the injunction on principles identical with those applied in abatement of public nuisances. The court relied on the case of In re Debs, Petitioner, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 900. It held that, if the injunction was erroneous, jurisdiction was not thereby forfeited, that the error was subject to correction only by the ordinary method of appeal, and disobedience to the order constituted contempt, citing State v. Pierce, 51 Kan. 241, 32 Pac. 924. An injunction duly issuing out of a court of general jurisdiction with equity powers, upon pleadings properly invoking its action, and served upon persons. made parties therein and within the jurisdiction, must be obeyed by them, however erroneous the action of the \n\n[258 U.S. 181, 190]\n\u00a0\n court may be, even if the error be in the assumption of the validity of a seeming, but void law going to the merits of the case. It is for the court of first instance to determine the question of the validity of the law, and until its decision is reversed for error by orderly review, either by itself or by a higher court, its orders based on its decision are to be respected, and disobedience of them is contempt of its lawful authority, to be punished.

Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 573\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 165, 8 Ann. Cas. 265.\n It is to be observed, moreover, that the injunction suit in the district court was not the enforcement of the Industrial Relations Court Act. It was a proceeding wholly independent of that act and the district court in entertaining it did not depend on the constitutionality of that act for its jurisdiction or the justification of its order. The state Supreme Court, it is true, did go into an extended discussion of the constitutional principles upon which the Industrial Court Act could in its opinion validly rest, but, as the court itself had before intimated, the discussion was not necessary to the conclusion which it had reached in sustaining the sentence for contempt.\n As the matter was disposed of in the state courts on principles of general, and not federal, law, we have no choice but to dismiss the writ of error as in No. 154.\n Writs of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUMP HAIRPIN MFG. CO. v. EMMERSON(1922)\nNo. 139\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 290, 291]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Colin C. H. Eyffe, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Clarence N. Boord, of Springfield, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1918 the defendant in error, as Secretary of State, assessed a tax of $6,045 upon the plaintiff in error, a corporation organized under the laws of West Virginia, for the privilege of doing business in the state of Illinois. The tax was paid under protest and this suit was instituted to recover the amount of it, based upon the contention that the statute under which it was imposed offends against the federal Constitution for various reasons; the only one argued in this court, however, being that, if given effect, it will constitute a regulation of, and impose a direct burden upon, interstate commerce.\n The case was tried on stipulated facts, from which we derive these as essential to a disposition of it: \n\n[258 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n In 1918 the authorized capital stock of the company was $6,000,000, of which $5,500,000 was reported by the company to the state as paid in and issued. It was a manufacturing corporation, with all of its tangible property in Illinois. Its method of doing business was to send salesmen into Illinois and the various other states to solicit orders, which, however, were not accepted until approved at the Chicago office, after which they were filled from stocks maintained in that city. The company represented the potential value of its patent rights, licenses, trade- marks, secret processes and good will as $5,124,126.72, and the total value of its real and personal property as $416,629.27-making a total in Illinois of $5,540,755.79. It also represented the total sales made by it in 1917, on which year's business the tax was computed, as $263,334.96, and of these $25,814 were made to residents of Illinois.\n The statute under which the tax was assessed reads:\n'It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to propound interrogatories from time to time to officers of such foreign corporations [with negligible exceptions] doing business in this state to ascertain the proportion of capital stock actually being represented by property located and business transacted in the state of Illinois, which proportion shall be determined by averaging the percentage of the total business of the corporation transacted in Illinois with the percentage of the total tangible property located in this state.' Hurd's Statutes 1917, p. 719,  67fb.\n\n In a recent case, American Can Co. v. Emmerson, 288 Ill. 289, 123 N. E. 581, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that it has been the policy of that state since 1872 to accord precisely equal treatment to domestic and foreign corporations of like character (Hurd's Statutes 1917, p. 703,  26 ), and that the fees for transacting business in the state are computed on the amount of the authorized capital stock \n\n[258 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n of domestic corporations and, at the same rate, on the amount of the capital stock of foreign corporations actually 'represented by property located and business transacted' in the state, as determined by the Secretary of State under the statute. The basis for the computation was $ 50 for the first $5,000, and $1 upon each $1,000 over that amount.\n Acting under these statutes, the Secretary of State concluded that, under the facts as we have stated them, all of the business of the company was 'transacted' in the state of Illinois, and, all of the tangible property of the company being in the state, he computed the tax on the entire authorized capital stock. The state Supreme Court sustained the assessment as valid.\n The contention of the plaintiff in error in this court is that, notwithstanding the manner in which it was done, the business which the company did with residents of states other than Illinois was interstate business, and that the treating of the amount of it as a part of the business of the company transacted in that state, in determining the percentage of the total business of the corporation transacted therein, renders the act under which the computation was made unconstitutional and void for the reason that the tax assessed is a burden upon interstate commerce.\n Plainly this contention cannot be sustained. The statute and the state Supreme Court both show a candid purpose to differentiate state from interstate business and to use only the former in determining the amount of the disputed tax. If the Secretary of State or the court, in computing the tax, erroneously treated as intrastate that which was really interstate business, such error would be reason in a proper case for correcting the computation, but would not justify declaring the act unconstitutional. The facts, that all of the property of the company was located in Illinois, that all of its manufacturing operations \n\n[258 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n were conducted in that state, and that all contracts of sale must be approved at Chicago, where the only business office of the company was maintained, certainly reduce the interstate element in its business to the lowest terms; but, nevertheless, we are constrained to hold that the business done with residents of states other than Illinois is interstate business, and therefore there remains the questions whether the use made of the amount of such interstate business, in determining the amount of the tax renders it invalid.\n While a state may not use its taxing power to regulate or burden interstate commerce (United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 U.S. 335\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 211; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617), on the other hand it is settled that a state excise tax which affects such commerce, not directly, but only incidentally and remotely, may be entirely valid where it is clear that it is not imposed with the covert purpose or with the effect of defeating federal constitutional rights. As coming within this latter description, taxes have been so repeatedly sustained where the proceeds of interstate commerce have been used as one of the elements in the process of determining the amount of a fund (not wholly derived from such commerce) to be assessed, that the principle of the cases so holding must be regarded as a settled exception to the general rule. Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Co., \n142 U.S. 217\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 121; Wisconsin & Michigan Railway Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 107; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 343\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 211; Baltic Mining Co. v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 15; Kansas City, &c., R. R. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 U.S. 111\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 58; U. S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 326\n, 327 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748. The turning point of these decisions is whether in its incidence the tax affects interstate commerce so directly and immediately as to amount to a genuine and substantial regulation of, or restraint upon \n\n[258 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n it, or whether it affects it only incidentally or remotely, so that the tax is not in reality a burden, although in form it may touch and in fact distantly affect it.\n No formula has yet been devised by which it can be determined in all cases whether or not such a tax is valid, and, applying the repeated declaration of this court, in the cases cited and in many others, that the question is inherently a practical one, depending for its decision on the special facts of each case, we are clear that the tax here involved falls within the excepted class described, even though the business done with residents of states other than Illinois be regarded as interstate.\n Clearly the statute is not a disguised attempt to tax interstate commerce. On the contrary, its purpose plainly is to differentiate state from interstate business and to impose the tax only on the former. Construed with other statutes the act accords equal treatment to domestic and foreign corporations, and clearly in this case property of the company beyond the jurisdiction of the state is not taxed-all of its property is in Illinois. To require foreign corporations to pay for the privilege of doing business in a state is, of course, a familiar and often approved form of taxation, and in this case the fee imposed is reasonable in amount.\n The tax is not imposed directly upon the proceeds of interstate commerce and is not computed upon it. The $235,000 of interstate business of the company is only one of three factors used in estimating or measuring 'the amount of the capital stock represented by property and business transacted in Illinois,' upon which the privilege tax in dispute was computed. The other two factors were $5,540,000 of property in Illinois and $25,000 of business stipulated as done with residents of that state. If the fee or privilege tax were computed at the statutory rate on the whole of the interstate business, it would be trifling in amount, but if computed on the property admitted to \n\n[258 U.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n have been in use in the state it would be but slightly less than the tax collected.\n If this same amount of tax had been imposed upon such a manufacturing corporation as we have here without reference being made to the basis of its computation, very certainly no objection to its validity would have been thought of. \n142 U.S. 229\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 163, supra. Or if the state had imposed an income tax, a part of which would have been derived from the net profits on this same interstate business, no valid objection could have been made to it. U. S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, supra. At most the assessment, so far as interstate commerce is concerned, is incidental, remote and unimportant and it is therefore constitutional.

WASTE MERCHANTS ASSN.(1922)\nNo. 245\nArgued: Decided: October 23, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. P. H. Marshall, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error. \n\n[260 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In March, 1919, the Waste Merchants' Association of New York filed in the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint under section 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce of February 9, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 384, as amended (Comp. St.  8581). It alleged that existing tariffs on paper stock shipped in carload lots from New York Harbor imposed upon carriers the duty of loading cars; that the carriers had failed to perform this duty on shipments made by complainants' members; that these had been obliged to perform the service at their own expense; and that they were entitled, under section 15 of the act (Comp. St.  8583), to allowances therefor. The prayer was that the carriers be ordered to pay, by way of reparation, allowances for the loading service and also other damages for violation of law and that the carriers be ordered to observe the law in the future. The Director General of Railroads and 184 transportation companies were made respondents; extensive hearings were had; the Commission filed a report embodying its findings of fact and conclusions, entered an order dismissing the complaint, and on August 7, 1920, overruled a petition for rehearing based on alleged errors in conclusions of fact and of law and newly discovered evidence. Then, on behalf of the association members, this petition for a writ of mandamus was filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. It prayed that the Commission be directed to take jurisdiction of the claims, to allow damages and to fix the amount thereof. Upon a rule to show cause, objection was made to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter; and the case was heard upon demurrer to the answer, which set up more fully the proceedings before the Commission. The Supreme Court of the District dismissed the petition, on the ground that the relators, having participated \n\n[260 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n in and obtained benefits from the alleged violations of law, were not in a position to complain. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District, on the ground that upon the facts found by the Commission complainants were clearly entitled to relief. The case was remanded, with directions to issue the mandamus. 51 App. D. C. 136, 277 Fed. 538. It is here on writ of error.\n We have no occasion to consider the merits of the controversy before the Commission. That it did not dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction is clear. It heard the case fully. It found that the rates charged were not unreasonable or discriminatory in violation of the Commerce Act, nor unreasonable for the service actually performed in violation of the Federal Control Act. Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p. It found that the conditions complained of were an incident of the World War; that the arrangement for loading was a voluntary one beneficial to complaints' members; that there was no provision in the tariffs for allowance to shippers who load cars; and that therefore such allowance could not legally be made by the carriers. The Commission dismissed the complaint because it held that the petitioners were not entitled to relief. Waste Merchants' Association v. Director General, 57 Int. Com. Com'n R. 686.\n Petitioners sought in the proceeding to set aside the adverse decision of the Commission on the merits and to compel a decision in their favor. The Court of Appeals granted the writ. This was error. Mandamus cannot be had to compel a particular exercise of judgment or discretion, Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698; Ness v.

The case at bar is not like Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humbolt Steamship Co., \n224 U.S. 474\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 556, and Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 U.S. 638\n, 38 Sup.

Interstate Commerce Commission, \n252 U.S. 178\n, 40 Sup.

PAYNE(1922)\nNo. 224\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n - \n\n[259 U.S. 182, 183]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warren H. Pillsbury, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Messrs. A. S. Halsted, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Alexander Britton, and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.\n O. J. Burton, one of the petitioners, received injuries while working in the general repair shops of the railway company upon an engine that had been employed in interstate commerce and which was destined to be so employed again, and the question is whether redress for the injury must be sought through the Workmen's Compensation Act of California (chapter 586, California Statutes 1917) or under the provisions of the federal Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]).\n The proceedings were instituted by Burton by an application to the Industrial Accident Commission of the state, which set forth the facts of his injury and prayed compensatory relief. Payne and the railway company answered, setting up the defense of interstate commerce and the Federal act, and that the accident was caused by Burton's misconduct. The commission awarded relief. On petition for review by Payne and the railway company, the District Court of Appeal granted a certiorari and reversed the award of the commission. \n\n[259 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n The court, after stating the facts, expressed the view that 'the sole question for' its consideration was whether 'the engine at the time of the accident was engaged in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the federal Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65),' and concluded, after a review of cases, that Burton's work 'was so intimately connected with interstate commerce as practically to be part of it, and therefore' the commission 'had no jurisdiction.'\n The facts are not in dispute. It was stipulated that while Burton was drilling and tapping the boiler of the engine a piece of steel lodged in his left eye; that this was in the course of his employment and caused thereby, and occurred while he was performing service growing out of and incidental to the same.\n We may assume, though the fact is contested, that the engine was sent from exclusive employment in interstate commerce to the repair shops. It was sent there for general overhauling December 1, 1918, and was, to a certain extent, stripped and dismantled. It was estimated that the work upon it would be finished January 31, 1919, but it was not actually completed until February 25, 1919. The accident occurred on February 1st of that year. After the repairs were finished the engine was given a trial trip and finally put into service in interstate commerce.\n For its conclusion and judgment, the court reviewed a number of cases, 1 and considered that the principle they \n\n[259 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n established was simple, that its application had been rendered difficult by diversity of decisions in the federal and state courts, and that this court had fixed no rule by which the conflict could be resolved, but had remitted the decision of each case to its particular facts. Such action is not unusual, and it is not very tangible to our perception how any other can obtain when the facts in the case are in dispute. Propositions of law are easily pronounced, but when invoked circumstances necessarily justify or repel their application in the instance and the judgment to be rendered.\n And there is no relief from those conditions in the present case and our inquiry necessarily must be whether, considering the facts, the cases that have been decided have tangible concurrence enough to determine the present controversy.\n We may say of them at once that a precise ruling, one that enables an instant and undisputed application, has not been attempted to be laid down. The test of the employment and the application of the federal Employers' Liability Act (in determining its application we determine between it and the California act) is:\n'Was the employe at the time of the injury engaged in interstate transportation or any work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it?' Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n239 U.S. 556\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797.\n\n This test was followed in C., B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Harrington, \n241 U.S. 177\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 517, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n251 U.S. 259\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 130, 10 A. L. R. 1181\n\n\n Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co. is particularly applicable to the present case. It illustrates the test by a contrast of examples and by it, and the cases that have followed it, the ruling of the District Court of Appeal must be judged. The ruling is, as we have said, that Burton's work was so near to interstate commerce as to be a part of it. \n\n[259 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n The court, we are prompted to say, had precedents in Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Maerkl, 198 Fed. 1, 117 C. C. A. 237, and Law v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., 208 Fed. 869, 126 C. C. A. 27, L. R. A. 1915C, 17, and it was natural to regard them as persuasive as they were decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeal. Both were ably reasoned cases. They differed, however, in their facts. In the first case, Maerkl received injuries while employed as a car carpenter in repairing a refrigerator car at the railroad shops. In the second case, Law was 'a boilermaker's helper,' and at the time of his injury was helping to repair a freight engine, used by the railroad company in interstate commerce. It was held in both cases that the work of repair was in interstate commerce.\n The facts in the Maerkl Case, it may be said, do not identify it with the case at bar. The refrigerator car was not intended for use in interstate commerce only. Its use was for that or 'intrastate commerce as occasion might arise.' The facts in the Law Case do identify it with the case at bar. The period of repairs in it was 21 days, and it was cited as a precedent in Chicago, K. & S. Ry. Co. v. Kindlesparker, 234 Fed. 1, 148 C. C. A. 17, in which the duration of repairs, also upon an engine, was 79 days. The court expressed the view that the difference between that case and the Law Case was 'in point of time, not in principle,' and that the engine at the time of the repairs was an instrument of interstate commerce, and that Kindlesparker's work 'thereon was a part of such commerce.' The court seems to have been of the view, and, indeed, expressed it referring to the Law Case, that the test of the work was the instrument upon which it was performed, not the time of withdrawal of the instrument from use. This court reversed the case. \n246 U.S. 657\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 425.\n There are other federal cases in which the decisions are diverse. \n2\n And there are state cases of which the same comment may be made.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n We refrain from a review of our cases. They pronounce a test and illustrate it. We are called upon to apply it to the present controversy. The federal act gives redress only for injuries received in interstate commerce. But how determine the commerce? Commerce is movement, and the work and general repair shops of a railroad, and those employed in them are accessories to that movement, indeed, are necessary to it, but so are all attached to the railroad company, official, clerical or mechanical. Against such a broad generalization of relation we, however, may instantly pronounce, and successively against lesser ones, until we come to the relation of the employment to the actual operation of the instrumentalities for a distinction between commerce and no commerce. In other words, we are brought to a consideration of degrees, and the test declared, that the employe at the time of the injury must be engaged in interstate transportation or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it, in order to displace state jurisdiction and make applicable the federal act. And there is a difference in the instrumentalities. In some, the tracks, bridges and roadbed and equipment in actual use, may be said to have definite character and give it to those employed upon them. But equipment out of use, withdrawn for repairs, may or may not partake of that character according to circumstances, and among the circumstances is the time taken for repairs-the duration of the withdrawal from use. Illustrations readily occur. There may be only a placement upon a sidetrack or in a roundhouse-the interruption of actual use, and the return to it, being of varying lengths of time, or there may be a removal to the repair and construction shops, a definite withdrawal from service and placement in new relations; the relations of a workshop, its employments and employes having cause in the movements that constitute commerce but not being immediate to it. \n\n[259 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n And it is this separation that gives character to the employment, as we have said, as being in or not in commerce. Such, we think, was the situation of the engine in the present case. It was placed in the shop for general repairs on December 19, 1918. On February 25, 1919, after work upon it, it was given a trial and it was placed in service on March 4, 1919. The accident occurred on February 1st of that year, the engine at the time being nearly stripped and dismantled. 'It was not interrupted in an interstate haul to be repaired and go on.'

Kindlesparker, \n246 U.S. 657\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 425.\n Further discussion is unnecessary though we are besought to declare a standard invariable by circumstances or free from confusion by them in application. If that were ever possible, it is not so now. Besides, things do not have to be in broad contrast to have different practical and legal consequences. Actions take estimation from degrees, and of this life and law are replete with examples.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.

Y., for petitioner.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The International Railway Company owns and operates two public toll bridges across the Niagara river between the United States and Canada. One is at Niagara Falls, the other at Lewiston, a short distance below. Over each bridge the company operates regularly its passenger cars; and over each there is a heavy passenger travel also in other vehicles and on foot. For more than 20 years prior to June, 1920, the government had, at its own expense, maintained at the American end of these bridges customs inspectors, continuously day and night, including Sundays and holidays. Then the collector of customs of the port of Buffalo notified the company that on Sundays and holidays thereafter no vehicle (except trolley cars) would be permitted to enter the United States; that no passenger would be allowed to enter except after surrender to the customs guard of all personal baggage, even the smallest handbag; and that all vehicles (except trolley cars) and all baggage surrendered would be held by the collector, at the owner's risk, for examination on the next following working day. The company was further advised that continued service of customs inspectors on Sundays and holidays could be secured, if it would make application for a special license under the Act of February 13, 1911, c. 46,  5, 36 Stat. 899 (Comp. St.  5571), as amended by the Act of February 7, 1920, c. 61, 41 Stat. 402. Day and night customs service on ordinary week days was to be continued at the expense of the government as thereto \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n fore. The collector acted throughout under instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury.\n The act of 1911, entitled 'An act to provide for the lading or unlading of vessels at night,' etc., declares that immediate lading or unlading of any vessel or other conveyance can be had upon the obtaining by 'master, owner, agent or consignee' of a special license therefor. To obtain the license it is necessary that the applicant shall agree to pay to the collector of customs an amount equal to the extra compensation of the customs officers employed therefor at night or on Sundays or holidays, and shall give a bond conditioned to indemnify the United States against all losses which arise from granting the license. The compensation payable for overtime, including services on Sundays and holidays, was fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury at double the day rate; and the amount of the bond for a six months' license is fixed by the statute at $50,000. The amendment of 1920 provides, among other things, that the work for which extra compensation is payable by the licensee shall include that of examining 'passengers' baggage.' The company does not unlade any cargo at night or on Sundays or holidays, and does not contemplate doing so. It is interested only in preserving the passenger traffic passing over its bridges. This traffic on working days is not nearly as heavy as on Sundays and holidays. Discontinuance of the customs service on those days would, in large measure, destroy that traffic.\n The company brought this suit in the federal District Court for Western New York against the collector to enjoin the threatened action, insisting that the provisions of these statutes are not applicable to a toll bridge and that the collector is without power to exact, as a condition of continuing the service, that the company take a license with the attendant burdens. The District Court \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 510]\n\u00a0\n dismissed the bill for want of equity (271 Fed. 313); and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (273 Fed. 153). The case was brought here by appeal; and a petition for a writ of certiorari was also filed, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the merits. Whether the action taken and threatened exceeds the powers conferred by law is the main question presented.\n The act of 1911 contained no reference whatsoever to passengers or to their baggage or personal effects. It dealt exclusively with the grant of special permits for the immediate lading or unlading of vessels and other conveyances. It consists of five sections and a repealing clause. The first four prescribe the conditions under which such license shall issue and the proceedings to be taken thereunder. The fifth section gives the Secretary of the Treasury power to fix extra compensation to be paid customs officials serving at night, on Sundays, or on holidays in connection with lading or unlading under such special permit; and it provides that an amount equal to the extra compensation shall be paid to the collector by the licensee. The amendatory act of February 7, 1920, made no change whatsoever in the first four sections of the act of 1911 ( Comp. St.  5559-5562). It dealt solely with the extra compensation, merely substituting the new section 5, shown in the margin. \n1\n This \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 511]\n\u00a0\n substituted section defines what shall be deemed overtime, how the rate of extra pay shall be fixed, and what the work is, for which extra compensation shall be paid. In\n[,] The said extra compensation shall [TO] be paid by the master, owner, agent, or consignee of such vessel or other conveyance whenever such special license or permit for immediate lading or unlading or for lading or unlading at night or on Sundays or holidays shall be granted to the collector of customs who shall pay the same to the several customs officers and employees entitled thereto according to the rate fixed therefor by the Secretary of the Treasury: Provided that such extra compensation shall be paid if such officers or employees have been ordered to report for duty and have so reported, whether the actual lading, unlading, receiving, delivery, or examination takes place or not. Customs officers acting as boarding officers and any customs officer who may be designated for that purpose by the collector of customs, are hereby authorized to administer the oath or affirmation herein provided for, and such boarding officers shall be allowed extra compensation for services in boarding vessels at night or on Sundays or holidays at the rates prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as herein provided, the said extra compensation to be paid by the master, owner, agent, or consignee of such vessel[s]: Provided further, that in those ports where customary working hours are other than those hereinabove mentioned, the collector of customs is vested with authority to regulate the hours of customs employees so as to agree with prevailing working hours in said ports, but, nothing contained in this proviso shall be construed in any manner to affect or alter the length of a working day for customs employees or the overtime pay herein fixed.' \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 512]\n\u00a0\n this work it includes that 'in connection with the unlading, receiving or examination of passengers' baggage.' The contention of the government is that the mere insertion of these words in section 5 has the effect of establishing a system of special licenses applicable to toll bridges, which are not vessels or other conveyances, and on which there is neither cargo, lading, or unlading, but passengers who pass on foot or in trolleys or automobiles.\n The contention is at variance with the language of the act and with its history. Obviously the words 'vessel or other conveyance' are not appropriate to describe the plant of a toll bridge. Other provisions, also, of the act of 1911, like the requirement 'of entry of vessels and due report of other conveyances' before issue of the special license (section 4 [Comp. St.  5562]), show that it was not the purpose of Congress to make it applicable to the conduct of a toll bridge or the operation thereon of a line of passenger trolley cars. The clause in the amendment of 1920 by which the extra compensation payable under section 5 is extended to cover overtime 'in connection with the unlading, receiving or examination of passengers' baggage,' is given full effect, if applied to the baggage of passengers on those vessels for the immediate lading and unlading of whose cargoes special license may issue under the first four sections of the act of 1911. That these were the only overtime services in connection with passengers for which the amendment made provision is confirmed by its history. The injustice of denying to customs officials compensation for such overtime services was obvious. But the Secretary of the Treasury had been advised, after the passage of the act of 1911, as well as before, that he was without power to make-or to require the vessel owner to make-any payment therefor, since passengers' baggage is not 'cargo.' 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 123. To remedy this and other defects in the provision for extra pay, the amendment was introduced at the instance of the Treasury Department, \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 513]\n\u00a0\n with the approval of the United States Shipping Board and of the American Steamship Association. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Congress created two distinct systems for the examination of articles coming from foreign countries. One dealt with articles imported as merchandise; the other with passengers' baggage and personal effects. That distinction, established by the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat. 627, has been preserved in all later legislation. One Pearl Chain v. United States, 123 Fed. 371, 374, 59 C. C. A. 499. For merchandise there are elaborate provisions concerning entry, manifests, unloading, invoices, consular certificates, and bills of lading. Revised Statutes,  2581, 2867, 2962 (Comp. St.  5341, 5555, 5646) and 2872, as amended by Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  25, 23 Stat. 53, 59 (Comp. St.  5563). There are special provisions affecting importations from Canada and Mexico. Revised Statutes,  3097, 3098, 3099 (Comp. St.  5809-5811). Compliance with these requirements necessarily involves delays. Concerning passengers' baggage and effects the provisions are much simpler. They are designed to secure expeditious entry. Revised Statutes,  2799, 2800, 2801, and 2802 ( Comp. St.  5496-5499), deal with articles from foreign ports. There are additional provisions concerning \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 514]\n\u00a0\n articles coming from contiguous countries. Revised Statutes,  3100, 3101, 3102 (Comp. St.  5812-5814). That Congress intended by the act of 1920 to abandon this distinction between merchandise and passengers' baggage, which had been carefully preserved in the act of 1911, is not to be assumed.\n It is also insisted that the Secretary of the Treasury has authority, independently of the power specially conferred by the act of 1911 as amended, to issue the instruction complained of. The contention is that his instruction to the collector was not to compel the bridge company to pay the cost of the inspection service but merely to withdraw the service unless the company would agree to pay the cost; that since customs officials cannot be maintained at every point where merchandise may conceivably enter from contiguous countries, discretion must rest in the Secretary to determine whether the character and extent of the movement at a particular place justifies maintaining them there; and that the instruction given was a regulation under section 161 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  235), which had the force of law. Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 480\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112. To this contention it is perhaps a sufficient answer to say that the instruction given was obviously not a determination by the Secretary that the travel over these bridges on Sundays and holidays was not such as to justify the government in maintaining the inspection service. The travel was heavier on those days than on any other; and the service had been maintained continuously for more than 20 years. But there are other conclusive answers. Section 161 does not confer upon the Secretary any legislative power. Morrill v. Jones, \n106 U.S. 466\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 423; United States v. George, \n228 U.S. 14\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 412. A regulation to be valid must bereasonable and must be consistent with law. The instruction given lacks both of these essentials. To collect the cost of customs service from vessel owners or other is virtually laying a tax upon them. This cannot be done except by specific authorization of Congress. \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, unless so authorized, no official or employee may receive from the government pay for extra services. Revised Statutes,  1764 (Comp. St .  3233); United States v. Garlinger, \n169 U.S. 316\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 364. Nor may he receive in connection with his services pay from any private source. Act of March 3, 1917, c. 163,  1, 39 Stat. 1106 (Comp. St.  3231a). Customs officials especially are forbidden to receive such payment. Revised Statutes,  1790 (Comp. St.  3265). Furthermore, to impose upon the company the obligation of furnishing an indemnity bond covering losses which may accrue to the government from the action, not of the bridge company or of its employees, but of any passenger who crosses the bridge, was clearly unreasonable. It was this lack of power in the Secretary to impose upon others any part of the cost of the customs service unless specially authorized by Congress which led to the enactment also of the earlier legislation concerning special licenses for lading and unlading of cargoes. \n3\n The instructions here attacked profess to rest, not upon Revised Statutes,  161, but upon the act of 1911 as amended by that of 1920. T. D. 38290; T. D. 38429. The claim of such authority by virtue of the power to establish regulations for the Department was apparently first made in this suit.\n It is further contended that the petitioner has no standing to question the regulation which applies not to it, but to the owners of private conveyances and of personal baggage brought over the bridge. While these also might be entitled to seek redress, it is clear that the instructions given threaten vital interests of the bridge company to which a court of equity should afford protection. The \n\n[257 U.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of this court on appeal was also questioned. In support of the jurisdiction it is urged that the bill invoked rights under the Constitution as well as under the revenue laws; and treaty rights are also pressed upon us. Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 376; Merriam Co. v. Syndicate Publishing Co., \n237 \nU.S. 618, 621\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 708. Whether the appeal lies we need not decide. A writ of certiorari was also applied for and the question presented is of sufficient importance to require determination by this court. Montana Mining Co. v. St. Louis Mining Co., \n204 \nU.S. 204, 213\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 254.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the following reprint of the new section 5 the phrases omitted from old section 5 are bracketed and are in small capitals.

In presenting the report in the Senate on behalf of the committee Mr. Calder said: 'We have had a law on the statute books for a number of years permitting the lading and unlading of vessels at night, for which the government employees were paid in some such manner as is prescribed in this measure. But a year or two ago the Attorney General held that the men could not be paid for passing upon the baggage taken off ships at night, but could be paid for supervising the discharging of the cargoes. That caused some difficulty, because we found a customs official examining baggage at night and being unpaid for it, and right alongside of him a customs official examining cargo and being paid for that.' 59 Cong.

WRIGHT(1922)\nNo. 110\nArgued: Decided: March 20, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., Ernest W. Lewis, of Phoenix, Ariz. (M. J. Dougherty and G. A. Rodgers, both of Mesa. Ariz., and F. H. Swenson, of Phoenix, Ariz., on the brief), for appellant.\n Messrs. James M. Sheridan, of Washington, D. C., and George D. Christy, R. E. L. Shepherd, and Jos. E. Noble, all of Phoenix, Ariz., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, Irwin, a citizen of California, filed his bill of complaint in the District Court against the treasurer, the assessor, the attorney, the sheriff, and the members of the board of supervisors of Maricopa county, Ariz., citizens of Arizona. He averred that he had an interest, as a homestead entryman, under the General Homestead Act of Congress of May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. 392), and the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (Comp. St.  4700-4708), in land included within the Salt River reclamation project, in Maricopa county; that he had not fulfilled many of the conditions by him to be performed before the title to the land would vest in him; that meantime it was the property of the United States, and not subject to taxation by a state; that he brought the suit in behalf of himself, and also in behalf of other reclamation homestead entrymen within the Salt River project in Maricopa county, and their assigns, similarly situated, desiring to \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n avail themselves of the benefits of it; that the defendants had levied and assessed taxes against these homestead premises of plaintiff and the others in whose interest he sues, for several years, and had demanded payment of them, and threatened to collect them by suit and sale of such lands, and to assess them in the future; that such action was in contravention of article 4, section 3, of the federal Constitution, deprived him and his fellow entrymen of a privilege and immunity secured to them as citizens of the United States, deprived them of property without due process of law, and denied them the equal protection of the laws, all under the Fourteenth Amendment. He prayed for an injunction against the defendants and their successors in office, and each of them, as taxing authorities of Maricopa county, from further assessing said lands, collecting the taxes already assessed, or bringing suit to collect the taxes as delinquent, or to sell such interests. After answer and reply, the case was heard on an agreed statement of facts. The District Court dismissed the bill on its merits without opinion. This is a direct appeal from the District Court under section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 804 [Comp. St.  1215]), because the suit is one involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.\n On January 24th last the cause was submitted to the court by counsel for the appellant upon brief; counsel for appellees not appearing. Since that day a brief has been filed on behalf of appellees and considered by the court. When the case was called, counsel for appellant submitted a motion, suggesting that all the appellees, county officers of Maricopa county, Ariz., who at the time of bringing, hearing, and deciding the suit below were charged with the duty of assessing and collecting taxes therein, had, with exception of the sheriff and one of the three members of the board of supervisors, retired from office, and that \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n their successors had been elected and qualified. These successors, the present officers of the county, the appellant asked to have substituted as appellees in this case. The motion was inadvertently granted. The order granting it must be in part vacated.\n A suit to enjoin a public officer from enforcing a statute is personal, and, in the absence of statutory provision for continuing it against his successor, abates upon his death or retirement from office. Pullman v. Croom, \n231 U.S. 571\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 182. In United States ex rel. Bernardin v. Butterworth, \n169 U.S. 600\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 441, substitution was refused, although consent was given by the successor in office. This court said (\n169 U.S. 605\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 443):\n'In view of the inconvenience, of which the present case is a striking instance, occasioned by this state of the law, it would seem desirable that Congress should provide for the difficulty by enacting that, in the case of suits against the heads of departments abating by death or resignation, it should be lawful for the successor in office to be brought into the case by petition, or some other appropriate method.'\n\n In response to the suggestion, Congress passed the Act of February 8, 1899 (30 Stat. 822, c. 121 [Comp. St.  1594]) under which successors of United States officers who have been sued, may be substituted for them upon proper showing. In Caledonian Coal Co. v. Baker, \n196 \nU.S. 432, 442\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 375, it was held that the statute authorized such procedure in the case of a territorial judge appointed under a law of the United States. But no authority exists for the substitution of successors of state officers in such cases. We have examined the statutes of Arizona and find none in them. The Arizona Civil Code contains the following:\n'Par. 461. An action shall not abate by the death or other disability of a party, or by the transfer of any interest therein, if the cause of action survive or continue. In case of the death or disability of a party, the court, on \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n motion, may allow the action to be continued by or against his representative or successor in interest. In case of any other transfer of interest, the action may continue in the name of the original party, or the court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the action.'\n\n This does not permit the substitution of a successor for a public official sued personally.\n In the Butterworth Case, supra, it was sought to justify substitution under an act (Laws Md. 1785, c. 80,  1) which reads as follows:\n'No action, brought or to be brought, in any court of this state shall abate by the death of either of the parties to such action, but upon the death of any defendant, in a case where the action by such death would have abated before this act, the action shall be continued, and the heir, devisee, executor or administrator of the defendant, as the case may require, or other person interested on the part of the defendant, may appear to such action.'\n\n This court said (\n169 U.S. 605\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 443):\n'... We are unable to perceive that this statute either in its terms or its spirit, is applicable to cases like the present one. Neither the heir, devisee, executor or administrator of a deceased official would have any legal interest in such a controversy. Nor, in a case of a resignation, could the successor be said to be 'a person interested on the part of the defendant.\"\n\n What we have said applies to the motion for substitution so far as it relates to Sam F. Webb, sued as county treasurer, C. W. Cummins, sued as county assessor, and L. N. Laney, sued as county attorney, and the order granting the motion as to them is vacated, the motion is denied, and the cause is dismissed as against them, without prejudice, of course, to new suits against their successors.\n It may not be improper to say that it would promote justice if Congress were to enlarge the scope of the Act \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n of February 8, 1899, so as to permit the substitution of successors for state officers suing or sued in the federal courts, who cease to be officers by retirement or death, upon a sufficient showing in proper cases. Under the present state of the law, an important litigation may be begun and carried through to this court after much effort and expense, only to end in dismissal because in the necessary time consumed in reaching here, state officials, parties to the action, have retired from office. It is a defect which only legislation can cure.\n J. G. Montgomery, county sheriff, still remains as appellee in the case but as his taxing duties are only connected with the service of process in tax suits, it is doubtful whether, were he the only party here, an injunction against him would give the relief sought. It is not necessary to decide this, however, as will be seen from what follows.\n So far as the order already entered substitutes for C. W. Peterson and W. K. Bowen sued as county supervisors, C. S. Steward and Guy F. Vernon, who have been elected to be their successors, as appellees, it will stand, for the principle to be applied in their case is different. The rule requiring abatement of such suits against officials on their retirement, and forbidding substitution of their successors, does not apply when they constitute a board, having a continuing existence. Marshall v. Dye, \n231 U.S. 250\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 92; Richardson v. McChesney, \n218 \nU.S. 487, 492\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 43; Murphy v. Utter, \n186 U.S. 95\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 776. An examination of the statutes of Arizona as to the composition and duties of this board leaves no doubt that it is a continuing one. A county in Arizona is a body politic and corporate. Paragraph 2388 of the Arizona Code of 1913 provides that 'its powers can be exercised only by the board of supervisors or by lawful agents ... acting under their authority and authority of law.' The board has three members and is vested with very wide and varied powers, acting as a \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n board. Code, tit. 10, c. 4. Its members exercise official duties only as members of the board, and a quorum of two may act. Code, par. 2408. Every two years, either one or two members are elected, but the retiring members hold until their successors are elected and qualified. Code, pars. 2399, 2400. The motion should be granted so far as it asks the substitution in case of the two supervisors, unless it appears that, under the averments and prayer of the bill, an injunction against the board of supervisors alone will not aid the plaintiff. Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, \n165 \nU.S. 28, 35\n, 36 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 225. The bill prays an injunction against the collection of taxes already assessed for each of 12 years and against future assessments. Are the functions of the board of supervisors such that an injunction against them would prevent such collection and assessment?\n Under the Arizona statutes the procedure in the assessment and collection of taxes is that the county assessor makes the original assessment roll against the owners, and files it with the board of supervisors. Code, pars. 4860, 4874. The supervisors or a majority of them constitute a board of equalization, and revise the assessment roll, and send it to the state board of equalization. Upon its return from the state board, paragraph 4892 provides that the board of supervisors shall then proceed to assess taxes according to the valuation specified in the assessment roll, and upon completion of such assessment, the chairman of the board of supervisors shall annex to the roll, a warrant commanding the county treasurer to collect from the several persons named in the roll, the total taxes set opposite their respective names.\n It is the duty of the board of supervisors to levy the taxes, to direct all suits to which the county is a party, to supervise the official conduct of all county officials charged with assessing and collecting the public revenues, to see that they discharge their duties faithfully to direct \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n prosecutions for delinquencies (Code, par. 2418), to receive report of the treasurer and ex officio tax collector each year of delinquent lists of real estate taxes, to examine and compare them, and to correct them if any property therein reported is not subject to taxation, and to return them to the Treasurer for collection (Code, pars. 4909, 4912), and to exercise the same authority with respect to the 'back-tax book' for previous years.\n In view of these various duties of the board of supervisors, not only in respect of the levying of future assessments, but in the matter of correction and collection of delinquent taxes, it is clear that an injunction restraining the board from future assessments on the lands in question, or from taking any steps to collect the back taxes, would be substantially to secure the relief the plaintiff seeks.\n Coming now to the merits of the controversy, the point at issue is whether, when the plaintiff and his fellows completed all that they had to do under the original Homestead Act to perfect their right to a patent, they had an equity against the government which was taxable by the territory of Arizona, and its successor, the state. On the pleadings and the agreed statement of facts, it is admitted that the plaintiff and his associates performed all the conditions under the Homestead Act and that they duly took all the preliminary steps enjoined under the Reclamation Act; but it is averred, and not denied in the answer of the defendants, that a number of important steps remained to be taken by plaintiff and those for whom he sues in perfecting their claims under the Reclamation Act at the times these taxes were levied, and in the case of the plaintiff and some of the class, at the time of bringing this suit.\n Under the Homestead Act (Rev. St.  2291 [Comp. St.  4532]), every person making a homestead entry was required, among other things, to establish a residence upon the tract of \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n land entered, and maintain a residence thereon and cultivate it for a period of not less than five years, and to submit final proof thereof, upon which patent ultimately issued in due course, within seven years after the date of entry. The act was amended June 6, 1912 (37 Stat. 123 [ Comp. St.  4532]), to reduce residence to three years. Under the third section of the Reclamation Act (32 Stat. 388 [Comp. St.  4702]), the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to withdraw from entry, except under the homestead laws, any public lands believed to be susceptible of irrigation from the works he is about to initiate, and all homestead entries on such lands are made subject to all the provisions, limitations, charges, terms, and conditions of the Reclamation Act. The act further provides (section 5 [Comp. St.  4704]) that the entryman upon lands to be irrigated from the government works shall, in addition to compliance with the homestead laws, reclaim at least half of the total irrigable area of his entry for agricultural purposes and before receiving a patent for the lands covered by his entry shall pay to the government the charges apportioned against such tract as contribution to the cost of the works. The Secretary is authorized to fix a limit of area of land per entry representing the acreage which may reasonably support a family. The Secretary is given full power in section 10 (Comp. St.  4708) to make rules and regulations needed to carry the act into effect. He has done so. Under the act and the regulations contained in the General Reclamation Circular, each entryman is required to conform his entry to a 'farm unit' established by the Secretary within each reclamation project, and this has forced many relinquishments and cancellations of surplus land in homestead entries, leading to remedial legislation hereafter mentioned. The entryman is required to clear the land entered of brush and other incumbrances, to provide the same with lateral ditches for its effective irrigation, to grade the same and put it into proper condition for crop growth, and to plant, water, \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n and cultivate, during the two years next preceding the time of filing his final affidavit, half of the irrigable area of his entry, and to grow satisfactory crops thereon; i. e., crops equal to crops raised upon lands similarly situated. Upon final proof, a final certificate is issued to the entryman showing that he has performed all conditions precedent to acquiring the title. The patent, which is the formal grant, follows at the convenience of the Land Office and often is delayed. By the Reclamation Act, homestead reclamation entrymen were obliged to pay all water charges before a patent would issue, but the effect of subsequent legislation, in Acts of August 9, 1912 (37 Stat. 267 [Comp. St.  4538]), of August 13, 1914 (38 Stat. 686 [Comp. St.  4713a, 4713b-4714f]), and of February 15, 1917 (39 Stat. 920 [Comp. St.  4728]), is to divide the water charges into installments of varying percentages, falling due during a period of 20 years, from and after public notice by the government that the water is ready for use, and to allow a patent upon payment of all installments due at time of submitting final proof. If proof is satisfactory, a patent then issues, conveying a full legal title, but reserving a prior lien to the government, superior to all others, for all installments unpaid.\n The rule established by the decisions of this court is that, by virtue of its sovereignty and the constitutional power of Congress to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, no state can tax the property of the United States within its limits. This was recognized and enforced by the Enabling Act of June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 557 ), under which Arizona was, on February 14, 1912, admitted to the Union, for that act contained an express declaration that lands and property belonging to the United States or reserved for its use were exempted from taxation. Van Brocklin v. State of Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151, 168\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 670; Wisconsin Railroad Co. v. Price County, \n133 \nU.S. 496, 504\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 341. An exception to this principle, \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n or rather its nonapplication, is recognized where the government has by final certificate parted with the equitable title to a person subject to state taxation, and retains only the legal title by its delay in issuing the patent. Not until the equitable title passes can the state tax the entryman, except in case of mining claims (the reason for which we shall presently consider), and in cases in which express authority to tax is given in the statute. Bothwell v. Bingham County, \n237 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 702; Sargent v. Herrick, \n221 \nU.S. 404, 407\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 574; Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 251\n, 21 S. Sup.

Prescott, 16 Wall. 603.\n The county authorities in this case were in error in supposing that an equitable title passed from the government to the entryman here, when the latter had fulfilled the requirements of the Homestead Act. Had their entries been controlled solely by that act, they would have been right. But, as we have seen, their entries were made under that act as supplemented and qualified by the Reclamation Act; and the latter expressly entails on such entrymen additional conditions which must be performed before an equitable title or a right to a patent is secured.\n We are cited by counsel for appellees to an opinion of Judge Dietrich of the District Court of Idaho in a suit brought by the United States to enjoin Canyon county, Idaho, and its taxing officers, from taxing lands or the interests of settlers therein in the Boise reclamation project. United States v. Canyon County, 232 Fed. 985. The case involved two classes of lands. The first was of lands in which a patent had issued, conveying a fee in the land subject to a lien of the United States, superior to all \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n others, for future installments of water rents. The second was of lands in which the conditions of the original homestead law had been complied with, but the entrymen had not paid in full for their water rights, and they had not brought the requisite acreage under cultivation and irrigation. The court held that the interests of the patentees in the first and of the entrymen in the second class of lands were taxable by the state. In the first ruling we concur. The patent vested the full legal title in the entrymen. The fact that a lien was reserved on the face of the patent prior in right to all other liens for installments of water charges to fall due in the future did not prevent this, and the giving patents indicated an intention on the part of the government that it should be land of the entrymen, and of course it became taxable as such. Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Mayor et al., \n195 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 50.\n With the second ruling, in which the District Court was sustained by a decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho (Cheney v. Minidoka County, 26 Idaho, 471, 144 Pac. 343), we cannot agree. We cannot reconcile it with the cases in this court which we have cited above. The District Judge relies on the Act of June 23, 1910 (36 Stat. 592 [Comp. St.  4727]), which permits entrymen within reclamation projects, after having made satisfactory proof of residence, improvement, and cultivation for the period originally required under the homestead law, to assign such entries or any part thereof to other persons. Such assignees, upon subsequently submitting proof of the reclamation of the lands and upon payment of the charges apportioned against the same as provided in the Reclamation Act, may receive a patent, 'provided that all assignments made under the provisions of this act shall be subject to the limitations, charges, terms and conditions of the reclamation act.' By circular of the Secretary of the Interior, the entryman may mortgage his interest also. The argument is that this puts such an interest as the entrymen has in the lands \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n in the same category as mining claims, which have always been taxable. Elder v. Wood, \n208 U.S. 226\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 263. We do not think that mining claims present a convincing analogy. The basis of the mining interest is discovery and location. These give full opportunity to the locator of the claim to take out the mineral, and since the beginning this right and interest never has been dependent for its enjoyment on patent, and so it has been taxable. Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n. The rule has always been different in respect to other public lands, as the numerous decisions of this court cited above show.\n Even before the statute of 1910, a homesteader could mortgage his interest to help him in performing the conditions of earning his patent. Mudgett v. Dubuque & Sioux City R. R. Co., 8 L. D. 243. The care with which the government has thus framed its land policy to protect and encourage the homesteader is shown further in Ruddy v. Rossi, \n248 \nU.S. 104, 105\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 46, 8 A. L. R. 843. The government incurs heavy liability in providing water for these lands. It relies on the entrymen to reclaim them, thus finally achieving its sole object of adding arid tracts to the productive area of the country. In pursuit of this purpose, it has found the requirement that the entryman shall pay all his apportioned cost of the irrigation work before he gets title, too burdensome, and, as we have seen, the sum has been spread in installments over 20 years, and his title is given him after he has reclaimed the land and paid the few early installments due at that time. The act of 1910 does not purport to subject these lands to taxation while the title is as yet unearned, and its terms show that it is not intended to permit anything beyond what fairly falls within its express provisions. Its evident and sole purpose was to enable entrymen, whose entries were cut down in area by the Secretary of the Interior in prescribing farm units, to dispose of their surplus to others, who would be able to hold it, fulfill conditions, and secure a \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n patent, and avoid a relinquishment or cancellation of the surplus, which had been the consequence before the act. This is apparent from an amendment to the act of 1910 passed May 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 65 [Comp. St.  4727]), and from the Report of the Committee on Irrigation of Arid Lands of the House of Representatives of the 64th Congress, 1st Session, No. 127, upon which the amendment was adopted. To construe this remedial legislation, including the act of 1910, which is only intended to lighten the task of the entryman in reclaiming the land and acquiring title, so as to impose on him the new burden of state taxation, is contrary to its plain policy. We think, therefore, that the reason for the rule, making the acquisition of the equitable title the line between nontaxability and taxability, is stronger in case of reclamation homestead entrymen than in the instances where, before the Reclamation Act, it always applied. Moreover, the confusion caused in the past by the taxation, when specifically permitted, of indefinite and inchoate interests of the beneficiaries of government land grants, should prevent an inference of the congressional intention to depart from the rule requiring an equitable title in the entryman before state taxation, unless a purpose to permit earlier taxation is express or strongly implied.\n It is argued that it is not government property which is sought to be taxed here before final certificate, but only the interest of the entryman. In the case at bar, the taxes were in the first instance assessed against the land, but later the board of supervisors changed the form of the assessment, so as to insert the word 'equity' in the record. The power of the supervisors, under the Arizona statutes, to order such a change in past assessments is challenged. We do not think it necessary to decide this. It is enough to say that the entryman did not have the equitable title until they received the final certificate, and their interest in the government's land, until that issued, \n\n[258 U.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n was, for the reasons given, not taxable. Whether an interest like that of the entrymen in land not belonging to the government would be taxable property we have no occasion to consider.\n Of the taxes here complained of, those from 1907 until 1916 were levied before the Secretary of the Interior in January, 1917, had fixed for this project a farm unit of 40 acres to which each entry must conform. Certainly until the area which the entryman could receive was ascertained, no equitable title could pass.\n After the farm unit was established, the entryman had two years in which to fulfill the requisites of the statute. One of these, and as important as any, was the filing of the final affidavit showing that he had performed the conditions precedent to getting a patent, which he had to present to the land office for approval and final certificate, which, as we have said, gave him equitable title. From an exhibit to the bill, the accuracy of which is not controverted, it appears that, of the class of 49 entrymen for whom the plaintiff sues, 24 received a final certificate in 1919, and that 25, including the plaintiff, had not received a final certificate when the bill was filed. As to the former, assessment of all taxes assessed against them for the years 1907 to 1918, inclusive, was illegal, and the defendants J. G. Montgomery, sheriff, and J. W. Bradshaw, Guy F. Vernon, and C. S. Steward, members of the board of supervisors, should be enjoined from taking any steps to enforce collection. As to the latter, collection of all taxes assessed prior to filing the bill, and all future assessments for taxes on their interests as entrymen until final certificate shall have been issued to them by the United States government, will be illegal, and the foregoing defendants should be enjoined accordingly.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed, with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJACKMAN v. ROSENBAUM CO(1922)\n\nArgued: October 4, 1922Decided: October 23, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. F. Stambaugh, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. Leo Weil, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, the original plaintiff, owned a theatre building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a wall of which went to the edge of his line. Proceeding under a statute of Pennsylvania the defendant, owner of the adjoining land began to build a party wall, intending to incorporate the plaintiff's wall. The city authorities decided that the latter was not safe and ordered its removal, which was done by the contractor employed by the defendant. The plaintiff later brought this suit. The declaration did not set up that the entry upon the plaintiff's land was unlawful, but alleged wrongful delay in completing the wall and the use of improper methods. It claimed damages for the failure to restore the plaintiff's building to the equivalent of its former condition, and for the delay, which, it was alleged, caused the plaintiff to lose the rental for a theatrical season. At the trial the plaintiff asked for a ruling that the statute relating to party walls, if inter preted to exclude the recovery of damages without proof of negligence, was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. This was refused, the Court ruling that the defendant was not liable for damages \n\n[260 U.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n necessarily resulting from the exercise of the right given by the statute to build a party wall upon the line, and, more specifically, was not liable for the removal of the plaintiff's old wall. There were further questions as to whether the work was done by an independent contractor and as to negligence, on which the jury brought in a verdict for the plaintiff for $25,000; but the Court of Common Pleas held that the party employed was an independent contractor and that the defendant was entitled to judgment non obstante veredicto. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, holding among other things that the statute imposed no liability for damages necessarily caused by building such a party wall as it permitted, and that so construed, it did not encounter the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 263 Pa. 158, 106 Atl. 238.\n In the State Court the judgment was justified by reference to the power of the State to impose burdens upon property or to cut down its value in various ways without compensation, as a branch of what is called the police power. The exercise of this has been held warranted in some cases by what we may call the average reciprocity of advantage, although the advantages may not be equal in the particular case. Wurts v. Hoagland, \n114 U.S. 606\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1086; Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 U.S. 112\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 56; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 111\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487. The Supreme Court of the State adverted also to increased safety against fire and traced the origin to the great fire in London in 1666. It is unnecessary to decide upon the adequacy of these grounds. It is enough to refer to the fact also brought out and relied upon in the opinion below, that the custom of party walls was introduced by the first settlers in Philadelphia under William Penn and has prevailed in the State ever since. It is illustrated by statutes concerning Philadelphia going back to 1721, 1 Dallas, Laws of Pennsylvania, 152; and by an \n\n[260 U.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1794 for Pittsburgh, 3 Dallas, Laws, 588, 591, referring to the Act incorporating the borough of Reading, 2 Dallas, Laws, 124, 129.\n The Fourteenth Amendment, itself a historical product, did not destroy history for the States and substitute mechanical compartments of law all exactly alike. If a thing has been practiced for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it, as is well illustrated by Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94, 104\n, 112 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 433, 17 A. L. R. 873. See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 466. Such words as 'right' are a constant solicitation to fallacy. We say a man has a right to the land that he has bought and that to subject a strip six inches or a foot wide to liability to use for a party wall therefore takes his right to that extent. It might be so and we might be driven to the economic and social considerations that we have mentioned if the law were an innovation, now heard of for the first time. But if, from what we may call time immemorial, it has been the understanding that the burden exists, the land owner does not have the right to that part of his land except as so qualified and the statute that embodies that understanding does not need to invoke the police power.\n Of course a case could be imagined where the modest mutualities of simple townspeople might become something very different when extended to buildings like those of modern New York. There was a suggestion of such a difference in this case. But although the foundations spread wide, the wall above the surface of the ground was only thirteen inches thick, or six and a half on the plaintiff's land, and as the damage complained of was a necessary incident to any such building, the question how far the liability might be extended does not arise. It follows, as stated by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that 'when either lot holder builds upon his own property \n\n[260 U.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n up to the division line, he does so with the knowledge that, in case of the erection of a party wall, that part of his building which encroaches upon the portion of the land subject to the easement will have to come down, if not suitable for incorporation into the new wall.' In a case involving local history as this does we should be slow to overrule the decision of Courts steeped in the local tradition even if we saw reasons for doubting it, which in this case we do not.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN L WHITING-J J ADAMS CO. v.

Byrnes, David A. Reed, George H. Parmelee, and George E. Stebbins, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In October, 1913, Frederic E. Baldwin, a citizen of New York, together with the present petitioner John Simmons Company, a corporation and citizen of that state, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the Grier Bros. Company, a corporation and citizen of the latter state, charging infringement of reissued letters patent No. 13,542, issued to and owned by Baldwin, and under which the Simmons Company was sole licensee, for certain improvements in acetylene gas lamps intended for various uses, especially that of miners' lanterns. The bill charged also unfair competition with plaintiffs by the sale of lamps made to resemble the Baldwin lamp manufactured under the patent. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction as to unfair competition, but reserved the question of patent infringement for final hearing. \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 84]\n\u00a0\n 210 Fed. 560. Upon that hearing the court held claim 4 of the Baldwin reissue patent valid and infringed, and awarded a permanent injunction upon both grounds, July 24, 1914, with an interlocutory decree for an accounting. 215 Fed. 735. Upon appeal by defendant (the present respondent ), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the decree as to unfair competition, but reversed it as to patent infringement, holding the reissue to be void as to claim 4 upon the ground that this broadened the original patent. Grier Bros. Co. v. Baldwin, 219 Fed. 735, 739, 135 C. C. A. 433. This decision was rendered January 22, 1915, and the mandate went down about a month later setting forth the decree of the appellate court that the decree of the District Court be 'affirmed as to so much thereof as refers to the subject of unfair competition, but the rest of the decree must be modified in accordance with the opinion of this court,' and that the appellant recover costs and have execution therefor, and thereupon commanding that execution and further proceedings be had according to right and justice. No decree was entered upon this in the District Court until January 5, 1916, when, on motion of plaintiffs, an order was entered that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals be made the decree of the District Court, that plaintiffs recover from defendant their damages sustained by reason of unfair trade to be ascertained and reported by a master to whom reference was made for the purpose, that a perpetual injunction be issued restraining defendant from further unfair competition in trade, and that the bill of complaint as to infringement of the reissue patent be dismissed. The accounting before the master is still pending.\n In May, 1913, Baldwin had brought suit (John Simmons Company intervening) upon the same reissue patent in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Abercrombie & Fitch Company (Justrite Company intervening), and that court \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n adjudged the patent valid and infringed. 227 Fed. 455. On appeal this decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, November 9, 1915. 228 Fed. 895, 143 C. C. A. 293. On December 20, 1915, defendants in that suit presented to this court a petition for a writ of certiorari; January 10, 1916, this writ was granted (Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, \n239 U.S. 649\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 284), and under it, on December 10, 1917, the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was affirmed, this court holding, in direct opposition to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that claim 4 of the reissue was valid (\n245 U.S. 198\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 104). A mandate was sent down January 15, 1918, to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the proper decree was promptly entered thereon.\n Soon after this plaintiffs herein petitioned the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania for leave to file what was called a 'bill of review' against its decree of January 5, 1916. The court in the first instance refused, but without prejudice to an application to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for leave to file such bill. Upon application that court granted plaintiffs leave to make the application to the District Court, and authorized the latter court to take action thereon. Under this leave, application was renewed to the District Court, the proposed 'bill of review' being at the same time presented, and with leave of the court filed. This bill sets out the original bill and the proceedings had thereunder, as above recited, also the proceedings in the suit in the Second Circuit and the final decision of the court therein, alleging these as 'new facts' that had arisen since the decree entered in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on the 5th of January, 1916, and as showing that that decree was erroneous and contrary to law, in so far as (pursuant to the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit) it dismissed the bill as to infringement of the reissue \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n patent and failed to decree a perpetual injunction and ascertainment of damages as to infringement; prayed that the cause might be reopened and the decree rescinded and set aside, in so far as it dismissed the patent cause of action, and a new decree entered granting the relief prayed for in the original bill. Defendant answered, admitting in the main, or at least not denying, the allegations of the so-called bill of review as to the former proceedings and decrees in the courts of the two circuits, but denying that the lamp involved in the Abercrombie & Fitch Company suit ( the 'Justrite lamp') corresponded in essential features of construction with the 'Grier lamp' involved in the present suit; averring that the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the two circuits were not rendered on the same state of facts; that the bill was 'in fact only a petition for rehearing because of the decision of the Supreme Court referred to therein'; and that the decision of this court in the Abercrombie & Fitch Company suit formed no basis for a bill of review.\n Afterwards John Simmons Company by leave filed a supplemental bill setting up that it had acquired from Baldwin all his rights in the reissue patent, including all claims for damages and profits on account of the infringement. Defendant having answered this, testimony was taken to show the structural identity of the 'Justrite' and the 'Grier' lamps, and the cause came to hearing, with the result that the District Court found substantial identity between the two lamps in all essential features of construction, sustained the right of plaintiffs to maintain the bill of review, and held that its former decree, entered pursuant to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, so far as it held the reissue patent invalid, should be vacated and set aside, and a decree entered sustaining the validity of claim 4 of the reissue, finding defendant guilty of infringement thereof, and plaintiffs entitled to an accounting of profits and a perpetual injunction. \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n From the decree thus entered an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed it and remanded the cause, with directions to reinstate the decree of January 5, 1916. Grier Bros. Co. v. Baldwin, 265 Fed. 481. To review this decision the present writ of certiorari was allowed. John Simmons Co. v. Grier Bros. Co., \n253 U.S. 482\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 587\n\n\n The District Court, as will appear from an excerpt from its opinion reported in  note to the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (265 Fed. 483), treated the case as one based upon a true bill of review, and this as resting not upon new matter that had arisen since the decree, but upon error of law apparent on the face of the record without further examination of matters of fact.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, upon a recital of the different steps in the litigation, regarded the situation as one of plaintiffs' own creation, for the reason that, after that court's decision on the original bill, but before the mandate went down, although apprised of the contrary decision of the District Court of the Southern District of New York in a cause to which they were parties, plaintiffs made no request to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to withhold its mandate; that, after the mandate went down, and before a decree pursuant to it was entered in the court below, they knew of the affirmance of the decision of the District Court of New York by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, yet made no request to either court in the Third Circuit to have the entry of a decree withheld; that, on the contrary, with knowledge that this court had under consideration a petition for certiorari in the Second Circuit case, they prepared and of their own motion caused to be entered on January 5, 1916, the decree dismissing their suit as to the patent infringement; and after this court on January 10, 1916, granted the certiorari, they allowed the term to end without moving to suspend, open, or vacate the decree of January 5. The court held that, in effect, so far as plaintiffs were concerned, that decree was a consent decree, \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n and, while not going to the extend of holding that this was sufficient to bar them from maintaining the bill of review, did declare that the anomalous situation and consequent hardship, arising from the fact that a patent adjudged valid in one circuit by this court at the same time had been adjudged invalid by the Circuit Court of Appeals in another circuit, was due not to any fault of the law or of the patent system, but to the failure of plaintiffs to take steps that might have avoided it. Proceeding to consider the legal question whether the decision of this court in Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, \n245 U.S. 198\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 104, either showed an error of law apparent on the face of the record without further examination of matters of fact, or constituted a new fact discovered since the decree and materially affecting it, the court held, on the authority of Scotten v. Littlefield, \n235 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 125, Tilghman v. Werk (C. C.) 39 Fed. 680, and Hoffman v. Knox, 50 Fed. 484, 1 C. C. A. 535, that the bill of review could not be maintained.\n The cases cited are to the effect that, in the application of the ancient rule of practice in equity, based upon Lord Bacon's first ordinance (Story, Eq. Pl. [6th Ed.]  404), a change in the authoritative rule of law, resulting from a decision by this court announced subsequent to the former decree, neither demonstrates an 'error of law apparent' upon the face of that decree nor constitutes new matter in pais justifying a review.\n But a bill of review is called for only after a final decree-one that finally adjudicates upon the entire merits, leaving nothing further to be done except the execution of it. If it be only interlocutory, the court at any time before final decree may modify or rescind it. Story, Eq. Pl.  408 (a), 421, 425. In the so-called bill of review herein, it is an terms alleged that the decree of the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, entered July 24, 1914, was an interlocutory decree. The same is alleged as to the decree of January 5, 1916. Both allegations \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n are admitted by the answer, which at the same time asserts that the 'bill of review' is in fact only a petition for rehearing. Obviously, the nature of the decree is to be determined by its own essential purport and effect, not by the statements of the pleaders about it. But an examination of the record demonstrates that they correctly described the decree as interlocutory.\n The decree of July 24, 1914, although following a 'final hearing,' was not a final decree. It granted to plaintiffs a permanent injunction upon both grounds, but an accounting was necessary to bring the suit to a conclusion upon the merits. An appeal taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction, under section 129, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1121), extended to the revision of interlocutory decrees granting injunctions, followed by the decision of that court reversing in part and affirming in part, did not result in a decree more final than the one reviewed. The prayer for relief based upon infringement of patent and that based upon unfair competition in trade were but parts of a single suit in equity. The decree entered pursuant to the decision of the appellate court did not bring the suit to a conclusion for either purpose. As to unfair competition, it evidenced a quasi definitive decision in plaintiffs' favor, but an inquiry before a master still was necessary before final decree could pass; an inquiry not formal or ministerial, but judicial in order to ascertain the amount of the damages to be awarded. As to the claim of patent infringement, the decree evidenced a quasi definitive decision adverse to plaintiffs, which, if nothing occurred to prevent, would in due course be carried into the final decree. But it did not constitute a separation of the cause, nor dismiss defendant from the jurisdiction for any purpose; necessarily this decision remained in abeyance until the cause should be ripe for final decree; there was nothing to take the case out of the ordinary rule that there can be but one final decree in a suit in equity. \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 \nU.S. 518, 525\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 407, where it was held by this court, after some diversity of opinion among the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the different circuits, that an appeal to one of those courts under section 7 of the act of 1891, from which section 129, Judicial Code, was derived, taken from an interlocutory decree granting an injunction and awarding an accounting in a patent case, conferred jurisdiction upon the appellate court to consider and decide the case upon its merits, and thereupon direct a final decree dismissing the bill, if in its judgment it had no equity to support it, differed vitally from the case before us, since there an adverse decision upon the patent disposed of the entire merits, the suit having no other object. Nor was the situation presented in the present case analogous to that passed upon by this court in Hill v. Chicago & Evanston Railroad Co., \n140 U.S. 52\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 690, which arose out of its decision in \n129 U.S. 170\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 269 32 L. Ed. 651. There a decree was held final for the purposes of an appeal, which dismissed the bill as to certain parties and denied relief 'upon all matters and things in controversy,' although it left undetermined a severable matter in which those parties had no interest. The test of finality here to be applied is rather that exemplified by Keystone Iron Co. v. Martin, \n132 U.S. 91\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 32, and cases cited. In Ex parte National Enameling Co., \n201 \nU.S. 156, 165\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 404, it was pointed out that the rule of the Hill Case cannot apply to a case in which there is but a single defendant.\n Regarding, therefore, the decree of January 5, 1916, as an interlocutory, not a final, one, there is neither technical nor substantial ground for applying to it the rules pertaining to a bill of review, and the bill herein called such is to be treated as essentially a petition for rehearing. By the sixty-ninth equity rule (\n226 U.S. 669\n, 33 Sup. Ct. xxxviii) such a petition is in order at the term of the entry of the final decree; and, of course, if an interlocutory decree be involved, a \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 91]\n\u00a0\n rehearing may be sought at any time before final decree, provided due diligence be employed and a revision be otherwise consonant with equity.\n As the decree in question was entered pursuant to the mandate of an appellate court, proper deference to its authority required that a proceeding to reopen it, whether by rehearing or review, should be first referred to that tribunal. Southard v. Russell, 16 How. 547, 570, 571; In re Potts, \n166 \nU.S. 263, 267\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 520; National Brake Co. v. Christensen, \n254 U.S. 425\n, 430-431, 41 Sup. Ct. 154.\n That having been done in this case, and leave for the purpose obtained (leave to grant a 'review' fairly included any step short of that) 8 what obstacle stood in the way of correcting the decree? The suit was still pending; plaintiffs applied promptly after the decision of this court in the Abercrombie & Fitch Co. suit, \n245 U.S. 198\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 104. It was eminently proper that the decree in the present suit should be made to conform to that decision, in the absence of some special obstacle. We cannot assent to the view of the court below that plaintiffs may be regarded as consenting to the decree of January 5, 1916; they simply accepted an adverse decision as to a part of their suit, not open to further appeal at their instance, and proceeded in the orderly mode to pursue their suit as to the rest. They were not guilty of laches for omitting at that stage to make application to this court for allowance of a writ of certiorari. That mode of review is not a right of the party, but lies in this court's discretion; peradventure the very fact that a final decree had not yet been entered might have been deemed a sufficient ground for refusing the writ. Hamilton Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. & Co., \n240 \nU.S. 251, 254\n, 257 S., 258, 36 Sup. Ct. 269.\n Our decision in Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, \n245 U.S. 198\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 104, must be taken as not only demonstrating that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its disposition of this case upon the first appeal (Grier Bros. Co. v. Baldwin, 219 Fed. 735, 135 C. C. A. 433), but that \n\n[258 U.S. 82, 92]\n\u00a0\n the error, even though not amounting to 'error apparent,' within the meaning of Lord Bacon's first ordinance, afforded ample ground for setting matters right upon a rehearing before final decree, as was in effect done by the District Court. No sufficient ground is shown for the reversal of its latest decree.\n Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion to modify decree denied \n259 U.S. 576\n, 42 Sup.

Hall and Jay Bowerman, both of Portland, Or., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States to recover the value of lands that it alleges it was induced to part with through the defendant's fraud. The lands concerned had been in the Siletz Indian Reservation in Oregon and had been thrown open to homestead entry by the Act of August 15, 1894, c. 290,  15; 28 Stat. 286, 326. In addition to the usual fees a payment of $1.50 per acre was required, and three years' actual residence on the land was to be established by such evidence as was required in homestead proofs. The complaint alleges that the defendant, with intent to acquire title to the lands mentioned for himself and associates, procured certain old soldiers, named, to make homestead applications and entries upon land pointed out by him, each previously signing an agreement with him by which for his information and services in drawing papers and affidavits the entryman was to pay him $185; the entryman was to employ him to build a home upon the land, paying him for that $100, and to clear or cultivate the land so far as required by the laws in order to perfect title, paying him for that $175. The entryman agreed to comply with the laws as to residence and the defendant agreed to do all the work required. The defendant agreed to advance, if required, not exceeding $60 for the fees of the land office, and, after final proof, at the option of the entryman, to procure a loan not to exceed $720, to be secured by a first mortgage on the claim, all payments stipulated from the entryman then to become due and to be payable out of the loan, or if there was no loan to be paid upon final \n\n[258 U.S. 40, 46]\n\u00a0\n proof, which was to be made as soon as the laws had been complied with.\n It is alleged that the agreement was intended by the defendant to conceal his intent to acquire title to the land; that the entryman did not intend to establish a residence upon the lands so entered and that the defendant knew that they did not inintend to and intended that they should not. The complaint goes on to allege fraudulent proofs made by the defendant's procurement, the issue of final certificates and subsequently of patents, in ignorance of the fraudulent character of the entries, the defendant in each case having received a mortgage as agreed. The answer admits the contract, denies all fraud and sets up that the final proof of the entrymen disclosed that they had not resided for three years upon the land as required by the Act of August 15, 1894, it then being supposed by every one that soldiers were allowed to count their time of service, as by Rev. Sts.  2304, 2305 (Comp. St.  4592-4593). The facts are admitted, and it is pleaded and argued that the issue of patents by officers of the United States with knowledge of these facts was due to a mistake of law for which the defendant could not be held responsible. The defendant pleaded some other matters to which it is not necessary to refer, including the fact that the causes of action did not accrue within six years-a defense that is not pressed here. See United States v. Jones (D. C .) 218 Fed. 973; Id., 242 Fed. 609, 616, 155 C. C. A. 299.\n After the skirmishes reported in the two volumes of the Federal Reporter the case came on for trial and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for $18,204.84. The judgment of the District Court was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. United States v. Jones, 265 Fed. 235. The first question argued there, as here, was whether the knowledge attributable to the United States that the entrymen had not been upon the land three years is a bar to a recovery. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it is not \n\n[258 U.S. 40, 47]\n\u00a0\n necessarily a bar. If the defendant is responsible for fraudulent representations of intent to establish a residence and to fulfill in good faith the other requirements for a homestead, and those representations induced the issue of the patents, knowledge of another fact that also would have prevented the issue but for a mistake of law does not take the right to recover away. We can see no reason why failure through ignorance of law to insist upon an independent ground for refusal should deprive a party to a bargain of its rights upon other grounds, or of its right to require good faith in regard to them. An express waiver would have no such effect.\n The defendant presents the case as if the only fraudulent representations charged were that the entrymen had been upon the land for a year or year and a half whereas in fact they were there much less, and then presses the argument that the falsity of such statements was immaterial because the statement as made disclosed the entrymen's want of right. But as we have implied, the charge of the Government goes much farther, and if the evidence as a whole tended to show the fraud that was charged, perjury as to the duration of residence would be a fact to be considered, especially if the time of residence fixed in the affidavits satisfied what everyone then thought were the requirements of the law.\n We may assume for the purposes of decision that the agreement and mortgage were not unlawful on their face and that the defendant took pains to make them known to the authorities; but obviously they might be made an instrument for the scheme alleged. They were prepared in contemplation of a plan to collect old soldiers for the purpose of making entries, the defendant paying an agent five dollars apiece for every contract brought in. The defendant admitted that he looked to the land not to the soldiers as his security and that he supposed the soldiers would sell the land to pay their debt to him. The \n\n[258 U.S. 40, 48]\n\u00a0\n land was timber land. There was evidence that the soldiers were not intending to make their residence upon it; that the agent employed to get their contracts knew that they were not intending to; that the defendant treated the intent as matter of indifference, and in his conversations with the agent indicated an expectation to get the land for himself or his nominees without the need of a preliminary contract to sell to him. He did get four of the nine parcels. Without going into details it is evident from the way in which the whole business was transacted that all hands proceeded on the notion that if the entrymen put in a periodical appearance on the land they would get it, and that no one troubled himself about actual intent provided the affidavits were in due form. It is impossible to say that the evidence did not warrant finding the defendant guilty of fraud.\n Some questions are raised as to the admissibility of evidence. The first concerns the introduction by the Government of similar arrangements with soldiers' widows to file claims on land in the Siletz Indian Reservation without settlement. If the Court in its discretion did not regard the evidence as too remote or as raising too lengthy or complex collateral issues, it properly might admit the facts as bearing on knowledge and intent, even if afterwards the defendant gave an explanation that the jury might deem satisfactory. So as to similar transactions with other soldiers. So as to the defendant's conduct with regard to contracts upon similar claims, although the evidence upon this point can have had but little weight on either side. The other question is upon the admission of certain testimony as to value. The land as we have said was timber land. There seem to have been no sales in the township where it lay, and timber experts knowing by experience and report current rates in adjoining townships were allowed to state them. Without \n\n[258 U.S. 40, 49]\n\u00a0\n going into the specific questions asked it is enough to say that we have examined them and find them all to have been well withln the discretion of the Court. See Virginia v. West Virginia, \n238 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 795. As the value found by the jury was very near to that set by the defendant, if not the same, we hardly see why the objection should have been pressed.\n The only occasion for difficulty or doubt is an instruction by the Court to the jury that if they found for the plaintiff the measure of damages was the market value 'with legal interest at six per cent.' from the date of the final certificates to that of the trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals disposed of this by saying that the attention of the Court was not called to the question of interest. The bill of exceptions states that the defendant excepted to that part of the instruction, while on the other hand the transcript of the proceedings in Court so far as intelligible would indicate that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right. The usual rule in tort cases has been to leave the question of interest to the jury. Lincoln v. Claflin, 7 Wall. 132, 139; Eddy v. Lafayette, \n163 \nU.S. 456, 467\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1082. But when the wrong consists of depriving the owner of property having a definite or ascertainable value there would seem to be the same reason for allowing interest as if there had been a misappropriation of money. The discretion of the jury does not mean the right to gratify a whim or a personal fancy. An indication of opinion on the part of the judge certainly would have been allowable, Graham v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 148; and the tendency of late cases in this country is to sustain the ruling. Shaw v. Gilbert, 111 Wis. 165, 196, 86 N. W. 188; Fell v.

Ewert, of Joplin, Mo., and Henry C. Lewis, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissing an appeal from a decree by the District Court which dismissed the petition, in a suit in which it was prayed that appellee, Paul A. Ewert, should be decreed to hold in trust for George Redeagle the title to 100 acres of restricted and very valuable Indian lands, which Redeagle, a full-blood Quapaw Indian, had, in form, deeded, in 1909, to Franklin A. Smith, who a year later, conveyed the same to Ewert. It was alleged that Smith, in bidding upon the land, acted as the agent of Ewert, who, it was averred, was legally incapable of purchasing it, because he was employed at the time by the government in Indian affairs. \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n Ewert is the same person who was appellant and appellee in Nos. 173 and 186, respectively (the Bluejacket Case, \n259 U.S. 129\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 442, 66 L. Ed. --) this day decided, and the validity of the deed in this case is assailed, as was the one involved in those appeals, on the ground that Ewert was not competent to make such a purchase under R. S.  2078 (Comp. St.  4026), which reads:\n'No person employed in Indian affairs shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians, except for, and on account of, the United States; and any person offending herein, shall be liable to a penalty of $5,000, and shall be removed from his office.'\n\n The facts in the two cases are very similar, except that in this case the evidence is clear that, regarding himself as prohibited from making the purchase and desiring to conceal his relation to it, Ewert procured Smith to bid on the land, to take the deed for it in his own name, and then, a year later, to deed it to him. The deed to Smith was for the consideration of $1,300, but the quitclaim deed from Smith to Ewert was for the recited consideration of $2,000. Ewert admitted in his answer that he purchased the land through Smith, as his agent; but, when pressed for a reason for the difference in the considerations, his reply was evasive and indefinite. The restriction on the land expressed in the patent and required by 28 Stat. 907, did not expire until September 26, 1921\n\n\n Here, as in the other case, Ewert, appointed special assistant to the Attorney General in October, 1908, 'to assist in the institution and prosecution of suits to set aside deeds to certain allotments in the Quapaw Agency,' is found in the following February bidding upon and purchasing this Quapaw Indian land.\n In the Bluejacket Case, \n259 U.S. 129\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 442, 66 L. Ed. --, we have held that, assuming the sale to have been made in the public manner required by the rules of the department, all required action to have been, in form, properly taken, and the deed therein to \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, nevertheless it was void, because Ewert was prohibited by R. S.  2078, from then becoming the purchaser of such Indian lands, and the construction therein given to the statute must rule this case, and render void the deeds herein relied upon to give him title.\n But this case presents several additional features.\n After the District Court decided in favor of Ewert and dismissed the petition, he paid $700, on July 5, 1918, to procure from Redeagle a stipulation to dismiss the action with prejudice, and for the same consideration and at the same time took from him a quitclaim deed for the land. Before hearing on appeal, by Redeagle, in the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ewert filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, based on this stipulation to dismiss the case, and the appellant, in turn, moved the court to cancel the stipulation and strike it from the files because, as he averred, it was procured by fraud and without notice to his counsel.\n When these motions to dismiss were presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals that court ordered that--\n'this cause be ... referred back to the District Court, ... with directions to investigate the circumstances of the stipulation for dismissal of the suit ... and to report to the court its findings and evidence whether, in fact and law, said stipulation is a final settlement of the case. This cause and motion to dismiss will stand continued in this court pending receipt of report from the District Court.'\n\n Both the Circuit Court of Appeals and the District Judge treated this order as one of reference, merely, to the District Judge (not to the District Court), to take testimony and report his findings of fact as to the validity of the stipulation, and pursuant thereto the District Judge took testimony and transmitted the same to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with his finding that the stipulation was a final settlement of the issues involved in the case, and \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n thereafter that court dismissed the appeal, reciting in its decree that its conclusion was based on the finding of the District Judge, and upon the reading and consideration of the evidence on which that finding was based.\n While the appeal to this court is thus only from this decree of dismissal by the Circuit Court of Appeals, it is plain that, if given effect, that decree would make an end of the entire controversy, and would confirm title in Ewert to restricted Indian land, such as we have held in the Bluejacket Case he was not competent to acquire, and it therefore is a final decree, the appeal from which brings, not only the validity of the stipulation for dismissal, but the entire cause, here for such disposition as the justice of the case may require. R. S.  701 (Comp. St.  1669); Ballew v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 187, 199\n, 200 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 263; Chappell v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 499, 509\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 397; Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 318\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 478; Cole et al. v. Ralph, \n252 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 321.\n On the reference by the Circuit Court of Appeals to the District Judge, various letters by Ewert to Redeagle were introduced which are of great significance.\n The decree dismissing the petition was not entered by the District Court until March 4, 1918, but two months before that, on January 3, 1918, Ewert wrote to his adversary, Redeagle, sending a copy 'of the opinion rendered by the court' (which was really only a short letter by the judge to counsel, stating that the case would be dismissed and directing that a decree be drawn), saying that he did so thinking that perhaps his ( Redeagle's) counsel might keep him in ignorance of the holding that 'you have no case.'\n On July 1, 1918, Ewert wrote Redeagle: That the decree of the District Court had not been appealed from; that the time for appeal, if not already past, soon would be (although two months remained for appeal); and that he wished him to 'thoroughly understand his rights.' And then, showing that he had been in treaty for settlement \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 144]\n\u00a0\n with him, he adds: If you sign the stipulation for dismissal, 'that ends the case forever,' and I am paying you this $700 with the distinct understanding that it does 'end the case forever,' and he suggests that, in order that it may do him some good, Redeagle should deposit the money in a bank. He adds:\n'If you cash it and get all the money, you probably will get drunk and lose it, and come back and say that somebody has been trying to cheat you. ... I have instructed my clerk that under no circumstances should she have any dealings with you when intoxicated. I just now met you down in the corridor of this building in an intoxicated condition; you wanted to come to my office, and I told you I would have nothing to do with you while intoxicated I have advised my clerk to the same effect, and if you are intoxicated when you come into this office I want you to state it, if it cannot be observed; If you have been drinking any, when you come into this office I want you to tell my clerk that fact, and she will have no business relations with you.'\n\n On the next day, July 2, 1918, Ewert again writes Redeagle that he had met him in the corridor on the day before; that, when he (Redeagle) wished to talk settlement of the case, he told him he would not talk business with him when he had been drinking. He tells him that he is leaving home to be gone six weeks, and that he has left a check for $700 in his office, with proper papers for him to sign, if he will come to the office 'sober and in your right mind.' He again suggested that, 'instead of getting this check cashed and getting drunk and losing all his money,' he should deposit the money in some bank, for 'in that way you will not be liable to lose the money.' He concludes the letter by urging Redeagle to come to his office at an early day, that he bring with him whomsoever he pleases, if they are reliable and 'sober' persons, that he will not settle this case with his attorneys, and that he must make settlement soon or the offer would be withdrawn. \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n Three days later, on July 5th, Redeagle went to Ewert's office with a neighbor, and there executed the stipulation for dismissal, and also a quitclaim deed for the land, and received $700. He paid the neighbor $100 for taking him to Ewert's office, put $50 in his pocket, left the balance on deposit in the bank, and proceeded to go upon a protracted spree.\n The clerk who delivered the check and the two witnesses to the paper say that Redeagle appeared to be sober when he executed them and to fully understand what he was doing; indeed, the clerk says, 'I should say he was more sober that morning than I had ever seen him.\n A number of witnesses were heard by the District Judge. Several said that Redeagle had had some education in his youth, but that he had been drinking heavily for many years, and had become so incapable of transacting business that they refused to have business relations with him. Others testified that when sober he was competent to do business.\n The District Judge announced that he adopted as the basis of his finding of fact the evidence of the Indian agent who had testified. Among other things, this agent said that, while he did not think Redeagle mentally weak, 'he was a drunkard.' 'He was like all drunkards; he wasn't fit to do business when drunk.' He said, when he was sober, he knew what he was doing, but he had been drinking a number of years, and it was injuring him; that he was improvident, but 'I don't think, just because he was a drunkard, he ought to be protected.'\n The District Court, in stating the effect of the evidence, said:\n'I am inclined to adopt the evidence of the Indian agent that he was an intelligent Quapaw Indian, but that he was profligate and dissipated, and that he finally became a drunkard, and that he was such during the year 1918. Now, as to the legal effect of that, I will let you brief that.' \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n The neighbor who went with Redeagle to Ewert's office to execute the stipulation testified that Redeagle came to him the day before nad offered him $50 to take him in his automobile to Ewert's office, a distance of 20 miles; that he declined, but finally agreed to take him for $100, which was paid him from the $700 received on settlement. On this and much other evidence the District Judge found that Redeagle was sober when he signed the stipulation for dismissal, that he knew its purpose and effect, and should be held bound by its terms, and the Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in this conclusion.\n\n Without further discussion of the evidence, it is sufficient to say that, while the witnesses differ as to whether Redeagle had deteriorated to the point of being incompetent to do business when temporarily sober, they all agree, and the District Judge agrees with them, that, long before the stipulation for dismissal was signed, he had come to be generally regarded, as a common, a habitual, drunkard, and we think the Cricuit Court of Appeals failed to give the weight to this fact which it deserves.\n That habitual drunkards are not competent to properly transact business is so widely recognized in the law that in many states statutes provide for placing them under a guardian or committee, with authority to put restraint upon them and to preserve their property, not less for themselves than for those dependent upon them. A typical statute makes--\n'all laws relating to guardians for lunatics, idiots and imbeciles, and their wards, ... applicable' to guardians for drunkards. General Code Ohio,  11011.\n\n The extent to which one must have fallen below the standard of ordinary business capacity before he will be generally recognized in a community as a common drunkard is so notorious that we do not hesitate to say that evidence of competency entirely clear should be required to sustain a transaction in which such a person has \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 147]\n\u00a0\n plainly, as in this case, been overreached by a person dealing with him who is competent and aggressive. Men so reduced will sacrifice their property, as they have sacrified themselves, to the craving for strong drink, and Ewert's letters show that he knew perfectly well that the Indian with whom he was dealing had reached that unfortunate stage of decay. They show him refusing to have business dealings with Redeagle three days before the paper was signed, because he had been drinking, but that at the same time he was eager to obtain from him a stipulation to dismiss the case, if only he could secure it under circumstances such that he could make plausible proof that he was temporarily sober. His letters, impressing upon Redeagle that his case was lost, that his lawyers were untrustworthy, and intimating that they had deserted him, joined with repeated offers of a sum of money sufficient to enable him to gratify, as he must have thought for a long time to come, the craving which had mastered him, if he would only sign away claims which he was repeatedly assured were valueless, could not possiby have been more cunningly devised than they were to constitute an irresistible temptation to such a demoralized inebriate.\n But whatever doubt we might otherwise have had as to the correctness of the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals is removed by evidence which was not before that court, and which is presented to and urged upon our attention by Ewert himself in support of a motion to dismiss, on the ground that the case had been settled after the appeal was taken. Redeagle died in November, 1918, and this evidence, which we may consider (Dakota County v. Glidden, \n113 U.S. 222\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 428; Elwell v. Fosdick, \n134 \nU.S. 500, 513\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 598; Gulf, Colorado, etc., Ry. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 508\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 542), consists of three quitclaim deeds from his children for their interest in the land in controversy and in the royalties for minerals mined therefrom. \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 148]\n\u00a0\n For each of these three deeds Ewert paid $6,000 in November and December, 1921. The difference between the $700 accepted by Redeagle and the $18,000 paid for the same property to his presumably competent heirs is most persuasive evidence of the condition of incapacity of Redeagle at the time the stipulation was obtained from him, even though he may have been temporarily sober when he signed the paper.\n Upon a full review of the evidence as it is now before us, we do not hesitate to conclude that Redeagle was not competent to contract, as in form he did, in the stipulation to dismiss, and that it must therefore be decreed to be void, notwithstanding the fact that at the time Ewert was not in the employe of the Government.\n But, it is argued, the quitclaim deed for the land executed at the same time as this stipulation, on July 5, 1918, was approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior on January 27, 1922, as appears by the copy filed with the clerk of this court, and that the doctrine of relation makes this deed effective from its date.\n Of this it would be enough to say that Redeagle was no more competent to make this deed than he was to make the stipulation which we have just held to be void; but we may add that the doctrine of relation is a legal fiction, resorted to for the purpose of accomplishing justice, 'to prevent a just and equitable title from being interrupted by claims which have no foundation in equity.' Lykins v. McGrath, \n184 \nU.S. 169, 171\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 450; Pickering v. Lomax, \n145 U.S. 310\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 860; Lomax v. Pickering, \n173 U.S. 26\n;1 Peyton et al. v. Desmond, 129 Fed. 1, 11, 63 C. C. A. 651. Obviously such a doctrine cannot be resorted to to give validity to a deed obtained under conditions such as we are considering-it cannot take root in such a soil. We cannot know what disclosure of the conditions under which it was executed was made to the department when the deed was approved; but we do not doubt that, if a full disclosure had been made, approval \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 149]\n\u00a0\n would not have been given, and the deed must be decreed to be void.\n After Redeagle died in November, 1918, this suit, revived in the names of the administrator of his estate and of his three heirs, was prosecuted to the decree of dismissal in the Circuit Court of Appeals in June, 1920, and the appeal to this court was allowed in August of that year. More than two years later, in 1922, a motion to dismiss the appeal was filed, based on the claimed settlement with the three heirs to which reference has been made in this opinion, and it is now contended that this appeal should be dismissed for the reason that there is no party remaining competent to prosecute it in this court.\n It is argued that the land involved continued under restriction until September 26, 1921, that neither it nor the royalties issuing therefrom could be incumbered until that date, and that both passed to the heirs so freed from charges of any kind that there was no property or estate for an administrator to administer and no function for him to perform.\n With this we cannot agree.\n The petition in the case prayed for recovery of the land and also for an accounting for rents and profits. That Redeagle or his heirs could institute such a suit is not disputed, and to maintain it he must employ counsel and create court costs, which should be paid. The record shows that large sums in royalties for zinc and lead ores mined from the lands involved had been paid to Ewert, and these when accrued were clearly personal property (United States v. Noble, \n237 \nU.S. 74, 80\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 532, which, on the death of Redeagle, would pass to his administrator for purposes of paying any inheritance or other taxes, which might be properly chargeable against it, and for other administration charges and for distribution. There being no congressional legislation providing for the administration of such intestate property, the state law is applicable, \n\n[259 U.S. 139, 150]\n\u00a0\n and we think the administrator is a competent party to assert the right of the estate, whatever it may be, to rents or royalties derived from the land during Redeagle's lifetime. If Ewert has succeeded to the rights of the heirs, he will, of course, receive their distributive shares.\n It is alleged in the petition, and not denied, that Ewert incumbered the lands involved with a mortgage, and against this indemnification is prayed for, which should be granted if it continues a subsisting lien.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to enter a decree canceling the deeds of Redeagle to Smith of March 10, 1909, of Smith to Ewert, dated April 23, 1910, and of Redeagle to Ewert, dated July 5, 1918, providing for an accounting for rents and profits and royalties, and for indemnification from any subsisting lien of any mortgage by Ewert upon the land, and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 19 Sup.

CO.(1922)\nNo. 51\nArgued: October 12, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 156, 157]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. P. Young, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. Bruce Scott, of Chicago, Ill., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.\n This action, under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8829), was brought by Keogh in the federal District Court for Northern Illinois, Eastern Division, in November, 1914. Eight railroad companies and twelve individuals were made defendants. The case was heard upon demurrer to a special plea; the demurrer was overruled; Judgment was entered for defendants, plaintiff electing to stand upon his demurrer; and this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 271 Fed. 444. The case is here on writ of error.\n The cause of action set forth was this: Keogh is a manufacturer of excelsior and flax tow at St. Paul, Minn. The defendant corporations are interstate carriers engaged in transporting freight from St. Paul to points in other states. Prior to September 1, 1912, these carriers formed an association known as the Western \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n Trunk Line Committee. The individual defendants are officers and agents of the carriers and represent them in that committee. It is a function of the committee to secure agreement in respect to freight rates among the constituent railroad companies, which would otherwise be competing carriers. By means of such agreement, competition as to interstate rates from St. Paul on excelsior and tow was eliminated, uniform rates were established, and interstate commerce was restrained. The uniform rates so established were arbitrary and unreasonable; they were higher than those theretofore charged; and they were higher than the rates would have been, if competition had not been thus eliminated. Through this agreement for uniform rates Keogh was damaged. The declaration contains a schedule of the amounts paid by him in excess of those which would have been paid under rates prevailing before September 1, 1912, and which, but for the conspiracy, would have remained in effect. He claims damages to the extent of this difference in rates. He also alleges as an item of damages that the increase in freight rates lessened the value of his St. Paul factory through loss of profits.\n Defendants set up the fact that every rate complained of had been duly filed by the several carriers with the Interstate Commerce Commission; that upon such filing the rates had been suspended for investigation, upon complaint of Keogh, pursuant to the Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887, c. 104,  15, 24 Stat. 379, 384, as amended (Comp. St.  8583); that after extensive hearings, in which Keogh participated, the rates were approved by the Commission; and that they were not made effective until after they had been so approved. The character of the proceedings before the Commission was more fully shown by reference to Keogh v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., 24 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 606; also Rates \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n on Excelsior and Flax Tow from St. Paul, Minn., 26 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 689; Rates on Excelsior and Flax Tow from St. Paul, Minn., 29 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 640; Morris, Johnson, Brown, Manufacturing Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., 30 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 443; The Excelsior and Flax Tow Cases, 36 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 349.\n The case is presented on these pleadings. Whether there is a cause of action under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act is the sole question for decision. Keogh contends that his rights are not limited to he protection against unreasonably high or discriminatory rates affored him by the Act to Regulate Commerce; that under the Anti-Trust Act he was entitled to the benefit of competitive rates; that the elimination of competition caused the increase in his rates; and that, as he has been damaged thereby, he is entitled to recover. The instrument by which Keogh is alleged to have been damaged are rates approved by the Commission. It is, however, conceivable that, but for the action of the Western Trunk Line Committee, one or more of these railrads would have maintained lower rates. Rates somewhat lower might also have been reasonable. Moreover, railroads had often, in the fierce struggle for business, established unremunerative rates. Since the case arose prior to Transportation Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91,  418, 41 Stat. 474, 485, the carriers were at liberty to establish or maintain even unreasonably low rates, provided they were not discriminatory. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n145 \nU.S. 263, 277\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 844; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 565\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 375.\n All the rates fixed were reasonable and nondiscriminatory. That was settled by the proceedings before the Commission. Los Angles Switching Case, \n234 U.S. 294\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 814. But under the Anti- Trust Act a combination of carriers to fix reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates may be illegal; and, if so, the government may have redress by criminal proceedings under section 3 (Comp. St.  8822), by injunction \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n under section 4 (Comp. St.  8823), and by forfeiture under section 6 ( Comp. St.  8828). That was settled by United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 U.S. 290\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 540, and United States v. Joint Traffic Association, \n171 U.S. 505\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 25. The fact that these rates had been approved by the Commission would not, it seems, bar proceedings by the government. It does not, however, follow that Keogh, a private shipper, may recover damages under section 7 because he lost the benefit of rates still lower, which, but for the conspiracy, he would have enjoyed. There are several reasons why he cannot.\n A rate is not necessarily illegal because it is the result of a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Anti-Trust Act. What rates are legal is determined by the Act to Regulate Commerce. Under section 8 of the latter act (Comp. St.  8572) the exaction of any illegal rate makes the carrier liable to the 'persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation,' together with a reasonable attorney's fee. Sections 9 and 16 (Comp. St.  8573, 8584) provide for the recovery of such damages either by complaint before the Commission or by an action in a federal court. If the conspiracy here complained of had resulted in rates which the Commission found to be illegal because unreasonably high or discriminatory, the full amount of the damages sustained, whatever their nature, would have been recoverable in such proceedings. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., \n242 U.S. 288\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 120. Can it be that Congress intended to provide the shipper, from whom illegal rates have been exacted, with an additional remedy under the Anti-Trust Act? See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. (C. C.) 162 Fed. 354. And if no remedy under the Anti-Trust Law is given where the injury results from the fixing of rates which are illegal, because too high or discriminatory, may it be assumed that Congress intended to give such a remedy where, as here, the rates complained of have been found by the Commission to be legal and while in force had to be collected by the carrier? \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n Section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act gives a right of action to one who has been 'injured in his business or property.' Injury implies violation of a legal right. The legal rights of shipper as against carrier in respect to a rate are measured by the published tariff. Unless and until suspended or set aside, this rate is made, for all purposes, the legal rate, as between carrier and shipper. The rights as defined by the tariff cannot be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 628; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, \n237 U.S. 94\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 494, L. R. A. 1915E, 665; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 U.S. 173\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 556; Dayton Iron Co. v. Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Ry. Co., \n239 U.S. 446\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 137; Erie R. Co. v. Stone, \n244 U.S. 332\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 633. And they are not affected by the tort of a third party. Compare Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 U.S. 577\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 27. This stringent rule prevails, because otherwise the paramount purpose of Congress-prevention prevention of unjust discrimination-might be defeated. If a shipper could recover under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act for damages resulting from the exaction of a rate higher than that which would otherwise have prevailed, the amount recovered might, like a rebate, operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors. It is no answer to say that each of these might bring a similar action under section 7. Uniform treatment would not result, even if all sued, unless the highly improbable happened, and the several juries and courts gave to each the same measure of relief. Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 440\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075\n\n\n The character of the issues involved raises another obstacle to the maintenance of the action. The burden resting upon the plaintiff would not be satisfied by proving that some carrier would, but for the illegal conspiracy, have maintained a rate lower than that published. It would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, also, that \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n the hypothetical lower rate would have conformed to the requirements of the Act to Regulate Commerce. For unless the lower rate was one which the carrier could have maintained legally, the changing of it could not conceivably give a cause of action. To be legal a rate must be nondiscriminatory. And the proceedings before the Commission in this controversy illustrate how readily claims of unjust discrimination arise. See Morris-Johnson-Brown Manufacturing Co. v. Illinois Central Railroad Co ., 30 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 443. For this reason, it is possible that no lower rate from St. Paul on tow and excelsior could have been legally maintained without reconstituting the whole rate structure for many articles moving in an important section of the country. But it is the Commission which must determine whether a rate is discriminatory; at least, in the first instance. See Abilene Case, supra; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Electric Elevator Co., \n259 U.S. 285\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 477. It has been suggested that this requirement does not necessarily bar an action involving that issue; for a court might suspend its proceeding until the question of discrimination had been determined by the Commission. But here the difficulty presented could not be overcome by such a practice. The powers conferred upon the Commission are broad. It may investigate and decide whether a rate has been, whether it is, or whether it would be, discriminatory. But by no conceivable proceeding could the question whether a hypothetical lower rate would under conceivable conditions have been discriminatory, be submitted to the Commission for determination. And that hypothetical question is one with which plaintiff would necessarily be confronted at a trial.\n Finally, not only does the injury complained of rest on hypothesis ( compare International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 222-224, 34 Sup. Ct. 853); but the damages alleged are purely speculative. Under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act, as under section 8 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Pennsyl vania \n\n[260 U.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., \n230 U.S. 184\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315), recovery cannot be had unless it is shown, that, as a result of defendants' acts, damages in some amount susceptible of expression in figures resulted. These damages must be proved by facts from which their existence is logically and legally inferable. They cannot be supplied by conjecture. \n1\n To make proof of such facts would be impossible in the case before us. It is not like those cases where a shipper recovers from the carrier the amount by which its exaction exceeded the legal rate. Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzar Co., \n245 U.S. 531\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 186. Here the instrument by which the damage is alleged to have been inflicted is the legal rate, which, while in effect, had to be collected from all shippers. Exaction of this higher legal rate may not have injured Keogh at all; for a lower rate might not have benefited him. Every competitor was entitled to be put-and we must presume would have been put-on a parity with him. And for every article competing with excelsior and tow, like adjustment of the rate must have been made. Under these circumstances no court or jury could say that, if the rate had been lower, Keogh would have enjoyed the difference between the rates or that any other advantage would have accrued to him. The benefit might have gone to his customers, or conceivably, to the ultimate consumer.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Central Coal & Coke Co. v. Hartman, 111 Fed. 96, 49 C. C.

SALM(1922)\nNo. 130\nArgued: January 27, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 122, 123]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Felix T. Hughes, of Keokuk, Iowa, for appellant.\n Messrs. Lee Siebenborn, of Carthage, Ill., and Clifton J. O'Hara, of Hamilton, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Company, an Illinois corporation, owns a bridge across the Mississippi river. That part of it which lies within the state of Illinois was assessed by the county assessors for purposes of taxation as real estate, and was valued at $100,000. To prevent collection of the tax the company brought, in the federal court for Southern Illinois, this suit for an injunction against the county treasurer and other state officials. It is claimed that the tax is void: First, because the bridge is a railroad and as such is assessable only by the State Board of Equalization; secondly, because, the property was deliberately assessed at 150 per cent. of its actual value, whereas the property of other corporations and individuals was assessed at only 40 per cent. of its value; and that thus the company is deprived of property without due process of law and is denied equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. A motion to dismiss was sustained by the District Court on the ground that the complainant has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. The case comes here on appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) because of the constitutional question raised. That such property is assessable by the county officials as real estate and not by the State Board of Equalization as a railroad was settled by People v. \n\n[258 U.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co., 287 Ill. 246, 122 N. E. 467; Id., 295 Ill. 176, 181, 129 N. E. 87.1\n Whether the bill sets forth a case for equitable relief is the only question requiring consideration.\n Since the appellant asserted a claim arising under the federal Constitution, the District Court had jurisdiction, although there was no diversity of citizenship. Discrimination in taxation effected by systematic inequality of assessment may violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban Railroad Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 502\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. But the bill failed to show that plaintiff was being deprived of property without due process of law or was being denied equal protection of the laws, or that there was any danger that it would be. Compare Wells Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 62. The law of Illinois affords ample opportunity to question the amount and the validity of an assessment both before administrative tribunals and in its courts.\n The provisions relating to the assessment and taxation of real estate apply to the assessment and taxation of bridge structures like that of the appellant. Hurd's Revised Statutes of Illinois 1919, c. 120,  354. Every such assessment made by the county assessors is subject to revision by them. Sections 319, 320. Moreover, upon complaint in writing that an assessment is incorrect, a board of review is required to give a hearing, and to correct the assessment 'as shall appear to be just.' Section 329; Standard Oil Co. v. Magee, 191 Ill. 84, 60 N. E. 802. Payment of taxes as finally assessed and extended against real estate is enforced, in the first instance, not by distraint or levy, but by legal proceedings. Sections 185-193. An application is made by the collector to the county court for judgment against the property. Compare Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. People, 145 Ill. 596, 34 N. E. 482; Id., 161 Ill. 514, 44 N. E. 206; Id., 167 Ill. 15, 47 N. E. 313; Id., 176 Ill. 267, 52 N. E. 117. \n\n[258 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding in the county court is a civil suit for the collection of a debt. People v. Merchants' Bridge Co., 282 Ill. 408, 118 N. E. 733. The owner may appear and defend on any legal ground; among others, that the assessment was deliberately or fraudulently discriminatory and that hence the tax is void. People v. Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co., 287 Ill. 246, 122 N. E. 467; Id., 295 Ill. 176, 129 N. E. 87. From the judgment of the county court an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court of the state upon giving a bond to pay the amount of the assessment and costs; and the appeal will operate as a supersedeas if the appellant deposits with the county collector an amount of money equal to the amount of the judgment and costs. If upon final hearing judgment for sale of the lands for taxes is refused, the deposit is returned by the collector to the appellant. Section 192. Moreover, where it is claimed that a tax is void because of overvaluation which is fraudulently discriminatory, the courts of the state will grant relief in equity, if the plaintiff has sought correction from the board of review and failed to secure redress. Sanitary District v. Young, 285 Ill. 351, 367, 120 N. E. 818. Here the alleged invalidity consists wholly in discriminatory overvaluation; and, so far as appears, appellant did not even apply to the board of review to correct the assessment. There is thus no basis for the contention that resort to a suit such as this was necessary to prevent, either a sale for an illegal tax creating a cloud upon title, or multiplicity of suits to recover back the tax, or other irreparable injury. See Singer Co. v. Benedict, \n229 U.S. 481\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 942; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 587\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 372; Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 U.S. 7\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 271.\n The bill fails, also for another reason, to state a case entitling plaintiff to relief. Before the suit was begun it had been decided that the taxing statute was valid, that the property was subject to taxation, that it was assessable as real estate, and that the assessment should be made, as \n\n[258 U.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n was done, by the county assessor, and not by the State Board of Equalization. The amount of the tax payable was therefore the only matter in controversy. Under such circumstances a plaintiff seeking an injunction must aver payment or tender of the amount of taxes confessedly due, or at least offer to pay such amount as the court may find to be justly and equitably due. People's National Bank v. Marye, \n191 U.S. 272\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 68; Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 38\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757.

U S(1922)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Felix T. Hughes, of Keokuk, Iowa, for appellant. \n\n[260 U.S. 125, 126]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant had an authorized bridge across the Mississippi River with a pivot pier and draw to permit the passage of vessels. As a necessary incident it maintained what is called a protection pier extending down stream. In consequence of later authorized constructions it became necessary to deepen the channel on the easterly side of the pier and the part of this work with which we are concerned was done by the United States. The bed of the stream by the side of the pier was solid rock and into this the United States drilled and blasted it with dynamite. The work was done in the usual way and with more than ordinary care, but by the action of the water driven upon the pier by the blast; and possibly by the concussion of the blasts themselves, portions of the pier fell into the river, and some damage was inflicted. It could have been repaired for $ 1,000. The company however rebuilt the bridge to fit it for heavier traffic, and brought this suit alleging that the pier was destroyed and in that way taken by the United States.\n An appreciable part of the claimant's argument consists in an attempt to reopen the findings of fact and to maintain that the pier was destroyed, as giving more force to the contention that it was taken. This, of it may be true that deliberate action in some United States, \n116 U.S. 154\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 325; Talbert v. United States, \n155 U.S. 45\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 4. We must assume, as we have stated from the findings of the Court of Claims, that the pier was not destroyed but simply was damaged in a way that could have been repaired for a moderate sum. However small the damage it may be true that deliverate action in some cases might generate the same claim as other forms of deliberate withdrawal of property from the admitted owner.

But without considering how the line would be drawn when such action took place in the improvement of navigation, it is enough to say that this is an ordinary case of incidental damage which if inflicted by a private individual might be a tort but which could be nothing else. In such cases there is no remedy against the United States. See Bedford v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 217, 224\n, 24 S. Sup.

S., FOR AND ON BEHALF OF CROW TRIBE OF INDIANS(1922)\nNo. 126\nArgued: November 27, 1922Decided: November 27, 1922\n\n\n Dicided Dec. 11, 1922.\n Messrs.\n Milton S. Gunn, of Helena, Mont., and Edgar Allen Poe, of Baltimore, Md., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Seymour, for the United States. \n\n[260 U.S. 423, 424]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n With the approval of the Secretary of the Interior certain lands of the Crow Tribe of Indians in Montana were leased to George B. Kirby and Charles McDaniels for the grazing of cattle for two years beginning February 1, 1916. A bond, in which the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company joined as surety, was given by the lessees for the faithful performance of their obligations. The lease required them to pay a minimum rental of $31,950 per year and to abide by the following provision:\n'And it is further agreed that the number of cattle to be grazed on the territory described above shall be limited to an average of 9,000 head, the maximum number at any one time not to exceed 11,500 head, and that any excess over and above such maximum number shall be paid for at the rate of $4.50 per head for each and every head of such excess number in addition to the rental herein named.'\n\n The lessees paid the rental of $31,950 for each of the two years, but failed to pay an additional sum claimed under that provision for cattle grazed in excess of the prescribed average.\n On behalf of the tribe the United States sued the lessees and the surety company to recover the additional sum so claimed, and the defendants answered denying that there had been any excess grazing. The issues were tried to the court, a jury being waived by written stipulation. The court found that there was no excess grazing during the first year, but that the cattle grazed during the second year exceeded 'the contract maximum average of 9,000 head for the year' by what was 'equivalent to 6, 968 head for one year.' For this excess a recovery was allowed at \n\n[260 U.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n the rate of $4.50 per head, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 273 Fed. 391. The defendants prosecute the present writ of error.\n The chief controversy is over the meaning and effect of the provision we have quoted from the lease. Pointing to it, the defendants contend (a) that any grazing in excess of an average of 9,000 head was prohibited, and therefore was a trespass for which no recovery could be had in a suit on either the lease or the bond; (b) that the additional payment at the rate of $4.50 per head was to be made only for any excess over 11,500 head grazed at any one time; and (c) that the intended average of 9,000 head was for the full two-year period and not for either year taken separately. Both courts below rejected these contentions.\n The provision relied on was loosely framed and, if read alone, might well be regarded as of uncertain meaning. But it is to be read with other provisions of the lease, with the written proposal of the lessees whereby the lease was obtained, and in the light of the conditions which naturally prompted some provision on the subject. When it is examined in this way, the explanation for it and its meaning are shown to be as follows: The parties recognized that pasturage being an annual crop, is lost if not utilized before the next growing season, and they evidently intended to deal with each year as a distinct period. A minimum rental of $31,950 was to be paid to the lessors for each year. Payment of that sum was to give the lessees the right to graze 9,000 cattle on the leased area for the particular year. But it was not practicable to have a definite number grazing throughout the year, for marketing some and bringing in others would cause the number to vary materially. So, an average of 9,000 head was agreed on. This would permit a shortage in one part of the year to be made up by a corresponding increase in another part. But to prevent this privilege from being carried to extreme lengths, the provision for an average \n\n[260 U.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n was qualified by saying 'the maximum number at any one time not to exceed 11,500 head.' The purpose of that provision, as thus qualified, was to define the grazing which might be done for the minimum rental of $31,950- in other words, to show that the grazing which might be done without further payment was limited to an average of 9,000 cattle. But the parties recognized the propriety of making some provision respecting the possible grazing of a larger number and the charge to be paid for it. Accordingly, they said in a succeeding clause that 'any excess over and above such maximum number shall be paid for at the rate of $4.50 per head.' The maximum number there intended was evidently the number which might be grazed for the minimum rental-that is to say, an average of 9,000 head; for, of course, the point to which that rental extended must have been the one at which the charge for additional grazing was to begin. It was not intended that any grazing should be free, but, on the contrary, that all that was not covered by the minimum rental should be paid for at the rate of $4.50 per head. The District Court aptly said:\n'The language of the lease, that this $4.50 per head is payable for 'any excess over and above such maximum number,' does not necessarily import only cattle over and above 11,500 head, the last antecedent and maximum eo nomine, but consistent with the writing and construction can be and is taken to import cattle over and above 9, 000 head, the first antecedent, and also a maximum, although not in terms so characterized. Nine thousand head are the maximum for the year as a whole, the principal thing, and the 11,500 are the maximum at any time (and for such time as will serve to accomplish the 9,000 maximum), an incidental thing. ... Defendants' argument that by the terms of the lease they are to pay only for excess over 11,500 head, and that for all between 9,000 head and 11,500 head they would be amenable only to the \n\n[260 U.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n relevant criminal law applicable to trespassers, is untenable.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals construed the lease in the same way, and we think that construction is the correct one. As the three contentions before stated all depend on a contrary construction they must fail.\n The $4.50 rate is assailed as being a penalty or liquidated damages, and therefore condemned by a statute of the state. We think it is neither a penalty nor liquidated damages. It was not to be paid for any breach of contract, but as compensation for particular grazing contemplated in the lease and not covered by the rental otherwise fixed. Whether the state statute could affect a contract made by the United States on behalf of Indian wards need not be considered.\n At the trial it appeared that the additional cattle were admitted to and grazed on the leased area by one of the lessees, who had special charge of the operations under the lease; and there was a conflict in the evidence as to whether the other lessee consented to or acquiesced in those acts. The District Court ruled that the conflict was immaterial and that the acts of the lessee in charge were the acts of both. Complaint is made of this, but it obviously was right. Kendall v. Carland, 5 Cush. ( Mass.) 74; Goshorn v. Steward, 15 W. Va. 657, 664.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKLINE v. BURKE CONST. CO.(1922)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: November 20, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Arnold and F. S. Quinn, both of Texarkana, Ark., for petitioners.\n Mr. James B. McDonough, of Fort Smith, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Burke Construction Company, a corporation orgainized under the laws of the state of Missouri, brought an action at law against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on February 16, 1920. The jurisdiction of that court was invoked upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, the petitioners being citizens of the state of Arkansas. The action was for breach of a contract between the parties, whereby the Construction Company had engaged to pave certain streets in the town of Texarkana. A trial was had before the court and a jury which resulted in a disagreement.\n Subsequent to the commencement of the action by the Construction Company, viz., on March 19, 1920, petitioners instituted a suit in equity against that company in a state chancery court of the state of Arkansas, upon the same contract, joining as defendants the sureties on the bond which had been given for the faithful performance of the contract. The bill in the latter suit alleged that the Construction Company had abandoned its contract and judgment was sought against the sureties as well as against the company. The bill asked an accounting with reference to the work which had been done and which remained to be done under the contract, and prayed judgment in the sum of $88,000. \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n In the action brought by the Construction Company the petitioners filed an answer and cross-complaint, setting up, in substance, the same matters which were set forth in their bill in the state court. In the equity suit the Construction Company filed an answer and cross-complaint, setting up the matters charged in its complaint in the action at law. Thus the two cases presented substantially the same issues, the only differences being those resulting from the addition of the sureties as parties defendant in the equity suit. Both actions were in personam, the ultimate relief sought in each case being for a money judgment only.\n The equity suit was removed to the United States District Court upon the petition of the Construction Company upon the ground that the company and the petitioners were citizens of different states and that the controversy between them was a separable controversy, and upon the further ground that a federal question was involved. Petitioners moved to remand. The District Court sustained the motion and the equity suit was thereupon remanded to the State Chancery Court, where it is still pending.\n After the mistrial of the action at law in the United States District Court, the Construction Company filed a bill of complaint as a dependent bill to its action at law, by which it sought to enjoin the petitioners from further prosecuting the suit in equity in the State Chancery Court. The United States District Court denied the injunction and an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That court reversed the decision of the District Court and remanded the case with instructions to issue an injunction against the prosecution of the suit in equity in the State Chancery Court. From that decree the case comes here upon writ of certiorari.\n Section 265 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1242) provides:\n'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n\n But this section is to be construed in connection with section 262 ( Comp. St.  1239) which authorizes the United States courts 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' See Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 399; Lanning v. Osborne (C. C.) 79 Fed. 657, 662. It is settled that where a federal court has first acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a cause, it may enjoin the parties from proceeding in a state court of concurrent jurisdiction where the effect of the action would be to defeat or impair the jurisdiction of the federal court. Where the action is in rem the effect is to draw to the federal court the possession or control, actual or potential, of the res, and the exercise by the state court of jurisdiction over the same res necessarily impairs, and may defeat, the jurisdiction of the federal court already attached. The converse of the rule is equally true, that where the jurisdiction of the state court has first attached, the federal court is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction over the same res to defeat or impair the state court's jurisdiction.\n This court in Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 182\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 355, 358 (28 L. Ed. 390), said:\n'The forbearance which courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, administered under a single system, exercise towards each other, whereby conflicts are avoided, by avoiding interference with the process of each other, is a principle of comity, with perhaps no higher sanction than the utility which comes from concord; but between state courts and those of the United States, it is something more. It is a principle of right and of law, and therefore, of necessity. It leaves nothing to discretion or mere convenience. These courts do not belong to the same system, \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n so far as their jurisdiction is concurrent; and although they coexist in the same space, they are independent, and have no common superior. They exercise jurisdiction, it is true, within the same territory, but not in the same plane; and when one takes into its jurisdiction a specific thing, that res is as much withdrawn from the judicial power of the other, as if it had been carried physically into a different territorial sovereignty. To attempt to seize it by a foreign process is futile and void. The regulation of process, and the decision of questions relating to it, are part of the jurisdiction of the court from which it issues.'\n\n And the same rule applies where a person is in custody under the authority of the court of another jurisdiction. Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 U.S. 254\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 309, decided March 27, 1922\n\n\n But a controversy is not a thing, and a controversy over a mere question of personal liability does not involve the possession or control of a thing, and an action brought to enforce such a liability does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction of the court in which a prior action for the same cause is pending. Each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without reference to the proceedings in the other court. Whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other, the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of res adjudicata by the court in which the action is still pending in the orderly exercise of its jurisdiction, as it would determine any other question of fact or law arising in the progress of the case. The rule, therefore, has become generally established that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment, another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.

A.) 267 Fed. 184.\n In Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Wabash Railroad Co., supra, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said:\n'It is settled that, when a state court and a court of the United States may each take jurisdiction of a matter, the tribunal whose jurisdiction first attaches holds it, to the exclusion of the other, until its duty is fully performed, and the jurisdiction involved is exhausted. ... The rule is not only one of comity, to prevent unseemly conflicts between courts whose jurisdiction embraces the same subject and persons, but between state courts and those of the United States it is something more. 'It is a principle of right and law, and therefore of necessity. It leaves nothing to discretion or mere convenience.' Covell v. Heyman, \n111 U.S. 176\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 355. The rule is not limited to cases where property has actually been seized under judicial process before a second suit is instituted in another court, but it applies as well where suits are brought to enforce liens against specific property, to marshal assets, administer trusts, or liquidate insolvent estates, and in all suits of a like nature. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street El. R. Co., supra; Merritt v. Steel Barge Co., 24 C. C. A. 530, 79 Fed. 228, 49 U. S. App. 85. The rule is limited to \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n actions which deal either actually or potentially with specific property or objects. Where a suit is strictly in personam, in which nothing more than a personal judgment is sought, there is no objection to a subsequent action in another jurisdiction, either before or after judgment, although the same issues are to be tried and determined; and this because it neither ousts the jurisdiction of the court in which the first suit was brought, nor does it delay or obstruct the exercise of that jurisdiction, nor lead to a conflict of authority where each court acts in accordance with law. Stanton v. Embrey, \n93 U.S. 548\n.'\n\n In Stewart Land Co. v. Arthur, supra, where the plaintiff sued the defendant upon two checks and a promissory note in the United States District Court, and subsequently brought an action against him upon the same instruments in a state court and an injunction was sought against the latter action, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit disposed of the matter as follows:\n'In the Iowa case there was no custody of property which might lawfully be protected by the injunctive process. It was purely in personam. The pendency of two or more such actions between the same parties upon the same causes of action in different jurisdictions gives to the court in which the first was brought no power to enjoin the prosecution of the others. Each may take its normal course.'\n\n Prior to the decision in the instant case, as an examination of the foregoing authorities, and others which might be added, will show, the rule was firmly established that the pendency in a federal court of an action in personam was neither ground for abating a subsequent action in a state court nor for the issuance of an injunction against its prosecution. In the case now under consideration, however, the court below held otherwise, upon the ground \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n that:\n'By the Constitution of the United States, article III, section 2, and the acts of Congress, 1 U. S. Comp. Stat. 1916, section, 991, the constitutional right was granted to the Burke Company to ask and to have a trial and adjudication by the federal court.'\n\n It is said further that if the second suit may be prosecuted so as to secure an adjudication in a state court before the action of the federal court can be adjudicated, then the federal court's adjudication would be made futile because before it is rendered the controversy will have become res adjudicata by the adjudication of the state court. Such a result, it is urged, cannot be allowed because the Construction Company brought its action in the federal court in pursuance 'of a grant of this right in the Constitution and the acts of Congress' and it may not be deprived of that constitutional right by a subsequent suit in a state court.\n The force of the cases above cited is sought to be broken by the suggestion that in none of them was this question of constitutional right presented or considered.\n The right of a litigant to maintain an action in a federal court on the ground that there is a controversy between citizens of different states is not one derived from the Constitution of the United States, unless in a very indirect sense. Certainly it is not a right granted by the Constitution. The applicable provisions, so far as necessary to be quoted here, are contained in article III. Section 1 of that article provides:\n'The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'\n\n By section 2 of the same article it is provided that the judicial power shall extend to certain designated cases and controversies and, among them, 'to controversies ... between citizens of different states . ...' The effect of these provisions is not to vest jurisdiction in the inferior courts over the designated \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 234]\n\u00a0\n cases and controversies but to delimit those in respect of which Congress may confer jurisdiction upon such courts as it creates. Only the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is derived directly from the Constitution. Every other court created by the general government derives its jurisdiction wholly from the authority of Congress. That body may give, withhold or restrict such jurisdiction at its discretion, provided it be not extended beyond the boundaries fixed by the Constitution. Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8, 10; United States v. Hudson & Goodwin, 7 Cranch, 32; Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 448; Stevenson v. Fain, \n195 U.S. 165\n.1 The Constitution simply gives to the inferior courts the capacity to take jurisdiction in the enumerated cases, but it requires an act of Congress to confer it. The Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252. And the jurisdiction having been conferred may, at the will of Congress, be taken away in whole or in part; and if withdrawn without a saving clause all pending cases though cognizable when commenced must fall. Assessors v. Osbornes, 9 Wall. 567, 575. A right which thus comes into existence only by virtue of an act of Congress, and which may be withdrawn by an act of Congress after its exercise has begun, cannot well be described as a constitutional right. The Construction Company, however, had the undoubted right under the statute to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court and that court was bound to take the case and proceed to judgment. It could not abdicate its authority or duty in favor of the state jurisdiction. Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 533\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 695; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 282\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 501. But, while this is true, it is likewise true that the state court had jurisdiction of the suit instituted by petitioners. Indeed, since the case presented by that suit was such as to preclude its removal to the federal jurisdiction, the state jurisdiction in that particular suit was exclusive. It was, therefore, equally \n\n[260 U.S. 226, 235]\n\u00a0\n the duty of the state court to take the case and proceed to judgment. There can be no question of judicial supremacy, or of superiority of individual right. The well-established rule, to which we have referred, that where the action is one in rem that court-whether state or federal- which first acquires jurisdiction draws to itself the exclusive authority to control and dispose of the res, involves the conclusion that the rights of the litigants to invoke the jurisdiction of the respective courts are of equal rank. See Heidritter v. Elizabeth Oil Cloth Co., \n122 \nU.S. 294, 305\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 135. The rank and authority of the courts are equal, but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt to do so would result in unseemly conflict. The rule, therefore, that the court first acquiring jurisdiction shall proceed without interference from a court of the other jurisdiction is a rule of right and of law based upon necessity, and where the necessity, actual or potential, does not exist the rule does not apply. Since that necessity does exist in actions in rem and does not exist in actions in personam, involving a question of personal liability only, the rule applies in the former but does not apply in the latter.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 25 Sup.

JACKSON(1922)\nNo. 167\nArgued: October 3, 1922Decided: October 16, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Philip Nichols, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.[ Knights v. Jackson \n260 U.S. 12\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[260 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin H. Abbot, Jr., of Boston, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Massachusetts taxes of a kind that used to be imposed by the cities and towns now are imposed and collected by the Commonwealth and afterwards distributed to the cities and towns to be expended for various public purposes. In this way are collected and distributed, with necessary exceptions, taxes upon the interest from debts, dividends from stock and from partnerships, Gen. Acts 1916, c. 269,  2, and upon the excess over $ 2,000 per annum of income derived from professions and business, again with necessary exceptions, Id.  5(b), both as amended. Dane v. Jackson, \n256 U.S. 589\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 566. The latter tax, under section 5(b), was increased 1 per cent. for the years 1918 and 1919 by an Act of 1919, c. 324,  1. The validity of these taxes per se is not disputed. They make a comprehensive income tax. But by an Act of 1919, c. 363, the Treasurer and Receiver General is directed to set \n\n[260 U.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n aside and pay over to the cities and towns from the proceeds of the income tax a sum sufficient to reimburse them for specified increases of salaries of school teachers, supervisors, superintendents and the like. Thereupon the plaintiff in error, a taxpayer, brought this suit, a petition for mandamus, to prevent the respondent from paying over as directed, contending that the Act of 1919, c. 363, imposed a public charge upon a special class of property and persons not specially benefited by the services and for that reason was a taking of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court, waiving questions of procedure, held that the income tax was a general tax; that the proceeds of the tax became part of the general funds of the State; that these funds could be expended for education, and that there was no appropriation of such a character as to make the tax a special tax for a special purpose or use. The petition was dismissed.\n We see no reason for not accepting the views taken by the Supreme Judicial Court. The plaintiff in error asks us to connect the increase of the tax for two years by the Act of 1919, c. 324, with the reimbursement directed by chapter 363, which he assails. This cannot be done, especially not for the purpose of attributing to the Legislature an attempt to achieve by indirection a result supposed to be beyond its power. The reimbursement from the general funds of the Commonwealth was lawful and to make it the funds must be provided. The fact that the end was contemplated, if it was, in this particular increase, is no more than was necessary in some form to bring about the result.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNOX v.

Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for defendant in error. \n\n[258 U.S. 546, 547]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the same principles and contentions passed on in Nos. 200, 236, and 303.\n It, as they, is an action to recover a tax ($11,819.74) assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as an additional estate tax on the estate of Jonas B. Kissam, deceased, under the Act of September 8, 1916, as amended in 1917. The action was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n The complaint was a voluminous paper and contained at least four causes of action. As to the first, consisting of 22 paragraphs, McElligott filed a demurrer. Plaintiff made a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was granted, and a final judgment was awarded against 'defendant on the merits, for the relief prayed for in the first cause of action set forth' in the complaint.\n The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 275 Fed. 546.\n The following four paragraphs are a summary of the allegations of the complaint stated narratively:\n In 1912 the decedent, Jones B. Kissam, was the owner of certain bonds and mortgages and corporate bonds. In that year he conveyed the property to the plaintiff in error, John C. Knox, who, shortly thereafter, reconveyed the same to Kissam and his wife, Cornelia B. Kissam, as joint tenants. All of the parties resided in the state of New York.\n In 1917 Kissam died, leaving Mrs. Kissam surviving him. She was made one of the executors of the will, as well as sole beneficiary thereunder.\n On Kissam. They included in the return the value of one-half of the jointly owned property \n\n[258 U.S. 546, 548]\n\u00a0\n which was owned and enjoyed by decedent, but did not include the value of the one-half of the jointly owned property, which had been owned and enjoyed by Mrs. Kissam since the creating of the joint estates in July and August of 1912.\n A tax of $5,354.14 based upon the return was paid by the plaintiffs in error. On May 9, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue added to the estate the one-half interest of the value of the estate and assessed as a tax in addition to that which was paid, the sum of $13,668.60. The additional tax was paid under protest and to recover it is the purpose of the action.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, stating the contention of the executors, said that 'they claimed that the assessment was void as to the half of the joint property which vested in Cornelia [Mrs. Kissam] before the passage of the Act of September 8, 1916, as amended, and also that the act itself was unconstitutional, as a direct tax upon property without apportionment among the several states, as required by article 1, section 9, subdivision 4, of the Constitution.'\n But this contention was the alternative of the contention which plaintiffs in error also made, that the Act of September 8, 1916, as amended, was not intended to have retrospective operation. And this was the decision of the District Court, the court saying: 'It is true section 201 provides that the tax is imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of 'every decedent dying after the passage of this act'; but the assumption must be that this relates to estates thereafter created and not to then existing property.' And the court added: 'At the time the statute was passed Cornelia Kissam's interest belonged to her.'\n The court further observed: 'From the structure of the act to say that the measure of the tax is the extent of the interest of both joint tenants is, in effect, to say that a tax will be laid on the interest of Cornelia in respect of which Jonas had in his lifetime no longer either title or \n\n[258 U.S. 546, 549]\n\u00a0\n control.' The court rejected that conclusion and denied to the acts of Congress retroactive operation. To this the Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed and reversed the judgment based upon it.\n It will be observed, therefore, that this case involves the same question as that decided in Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 U.S. 529\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 391, 66 L. Ed.-, and on the authority of that case the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAMBERT RUN COAL CO. v. BALTIMORE & O. R. CO.(1922)\nNo. 153\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank E. Harkness and Rush C. Butler, both of Chicago, Ill., and John A. Howard, of Wheeling, W. Va., for appellant.\n Messrs. A. G. G.utheim, of Washington, D. C., R. V. Fletcher, of Chicago, Ill., Hugh L. Bond, Jr., of Baltimore, Md., and George E. Hamilton, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage has been a fertile field of controversy. The subject has received much attention from Congress, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the courts. Definite rules for distribution were promulgated by the Commission; and they remained in force for many years. Among these \n\n[258 U.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n was the so-called assigned car rule declared by the Commission in Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Hocking Valley Railway Co., 12 I. C. C. 398, and Traer v. Chicago & Alton Railroad Co., 13 I. C. C. 451, and sustained by this Court in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., \n215 U.S. 452\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 155.1 As an incident of the war this rule was modified by the Railroad Administration acting in conjunction with the Fuel Administration, and the assignment of cars for railroad fuel was abandoned. When by the Transportation Act, 1920, provision was made for restoring the railroads to private control, section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce was amended, among other things, by inserting a paragraph numbered 12, which deals specifically with the distribution of coal cars. Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 476.\n In June, 1920, the Lambert Run Coal Company, a West Virginia corporation, which owns and operates a mine in that state, brought, in the circuit court of Marion county, this suit against the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, a Maryland corporation. The bill alleged that there was an acute car shortage; that the railroad had refused to make the distribution required by paragraph 12 of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and in violation thereof distributed cars in accordance with its own rules 8, 9, and 10, set out in the margin2, and that this course was resulting in irreparable injury to plaintiff. The bill \n\n[258 U.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n prayed that the railroad be restrained from observing these rules and that it be required to furnish cars in accordance with the established ratings.\n The defendant removed the case to the federal court for the Northern district of West Virginia and there filed in a single pleading a motion to dismiss and an answer. As grounds for the motion it alleged that the case was not one within the jurisdiction of the state court; that since it did not appear that the Commission had taken any action in respect to the matter complained of, neither court had jurisdiction of the controversy; that the plaintiff had concealed the fact that the rules of the carrier complained of were, as plaintiff knew, rules which had been promulgated by the Commission; that the bill was thus one to restrain enforcement of an order of the Commission; and that the United States and the Commission were indispensable parties. The answer set forth the facts supporting these allegations and, among other things, that the rules promulgated by the Commission and adopted by the carrier had been issued on April 15, 1920, in pursuance of the emergency provision known as paragraph 15, inserted in section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce by the Transportation Act, 1920, supra, 41 Stat. 456, 476.\n Plaintiff then moved in the District Court for an interlocutory injunction. The defendant, insisting that the \n\n[258 U.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n proceeding was one to stay an order of the Commission, objected to a consideration of the motion in the absence of two other judges as provided by Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St.  998). Both this objection and the motion to dismiss were overruled by the District Judge; and an interlocutory injunction in accordance with the prayer of the bill was issued. From this order defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. That court stayed the injunction pending the determination of the appeal, and later reversed the decree below with directions to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill. 267 Fed. 776. The reasons given by the Circuit Court of Appeals for its decision are, in substance, that the car distribution rule complained of appeared on uncontroverted facts to be that prescribed by the order of the Commission issued April 15, 1920; that this order was issued under paragraph 15 of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce; that it was within the emergency powers there conferred; that the rights and duties prescribed by paragraph 12 of that section were not absolute, but were subject to suspension or modification by the Commission in case of emergency, as provided in paragraph 15; and that, therefore, the bill should have been dismissed. It added that the District Court erred in issuing the injunction for the further reason that, since the relief sought was to enjoin an order of the Commission, it could be granted only by a court of three judges.\n The decree of the District Court was properly reversed; but we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no occasion to pass upon the merits of the controversy and that the direction should have been to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice. The rule of the railroad here complained of was that prescribed by the Commission. To that rule the railroad was bound to conform unless relieved by the Commission or enjoined from complying with it by decree of a court having jurisdiction. By this suit such a decree was in effect \n\n[258 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n sought. The appellate court was therefore correct in holding that in such a suit an injunction of the District Court could be granted only by three judges.\n But there are in addition two fundamental objections to the jurisdiction: First, the United States, an indispensable party to suits to restrain or set aside orders of the Commission, was not joined, and could not be, for it has not consented to be sued in state courts. Secondly, such suits are required to be brought in a federal District Court. Judicial Code,  208, 211 (Comp. St.  997, 1004); Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219 (Comp. St.  992, 994); Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 504\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 170; State ex rel. Lemke v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co. ( decided January 23, 1922) \n257 U.S. 485\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 170; State of Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission (decided March 6, 1922) \n258 U.S. 158\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 261, 66 L. Ed. --. The fact that this was a suit to set aside an order of the Commission did not appear on the face of the bill; but it became apparent as soon as the motion to dismiss was filed. Jurisdiction cannot be effectively acquired by concealing for a time the facts which conclusively establish that it does not exist. As the state court was without jurisdiction over either the subject-matter or the United States, the District Court could not acquire jurisdiction over them by the removal. The jurisdiction of the federal court on removal is, in a limited sense, a derivative jurisdiction. If the state court lacks jurisdiction of the subject-matter or of the parties, the federal court acquires none, although it might in a like suit originally brought there have had jurisdiction. Courtney v. Pradt, \n196 \nU.S. 89, 92\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 208; American Well Works v. Layne, \n241 \nU.S. 257, 258\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 585.3\n To the situation here presented, \n\n[258 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n cases like Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., \n237 U.S. 479\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 658, 59 L. ed. 1056, relied upon by appellant, have no application. For, while it is true that a plaintiff by his first pleading determines what right he will sue on and that the defenses, set up either anticipatorily by him or in due course by the defendant, cannot affect the jurisdiction when it depends on that right, yet the plaintiff may not, by alleging a frivolous claim or a fictitious situation, confer upon a court jurisdiction which, as determined by the plaintiff's real cause of action, it has not. The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., \n228 \nU.S. 22, 25\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 410. And the vital interest of the United States was one which the plaintiff could neither ignore nor prejudice by indirection. Compare International Postal Supply Co. v. Bruce, \n194 U.S. 601\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 820; Naganab v. Hitchcock, \n202 U.S. 473\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 667; Goldberg v. Daniels, \n231 U.S. 218\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 84; Louisiana v. McAdoo, \n234 U.S. 627\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 938. The District Court should therefore have dismissed the bill as soon as it became apparent that the suit was one to set aside an order of the Commission. Robinson v. Anderson, \n121 U.S. 522\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1011; Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., \n185 \nU.S. 282, 287\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 681; Devine v. Los Angeles, \n202 \nU.S. 313, 338\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 652. And the Circuit Court of Appeals, in remanding the cause to the District Court, should have directed a dismissal for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice.\n Decree modified and affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Rail & River Coal Co. v.

CARLILE(1922)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Lee D. Mathias, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Crim, Solicitor General James M. Beck, and Harry S. Ridgely, both of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, doing business in the name of 'Organo Product Company,' in his bill prayed for an injunction restraining the Postmaster at Chicago from giving effect to a 'fraud order' against him, issued by the Postmaster General on August 15, 1919, pursuant to authority of Revised Statute,  3929 and 4041 (Comp. St.  7411, 7573). The order was in the usual form, prohibiting the delivery of mail or payment of money orders to appellant, and directing the disposition of mail which should be addressed to him. The District Court, refusing the injunction, dismissed the bill, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its decree. Leach v. Carlile, 267 Fed. 61. \n\n[258 U.S. 138, 139]\n\u00a0\n The appellant was engaged in selling what he called 'Organo Tablets,' which he advertised extensively through the mails as 'recommended and prescribed by leading physicians throughout the civilized world for nervous weakness, general debility, sexual decline or weakened manhood and urinary disorders ... sleeplessness and rundown system,' and various other ailments.\n Appellant is an old offender, a prior fraud order having been issued against him, under another name, in April, 1918, as a result of which he changed his trade-name and modified in a measure his advertising matter.\n The order complained of was entered after an elaborate hearing, of which the appellant had due notice and at which he was represented by counsel, and introduced much evidence.\n The only error assigned in this court is the affirming by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the decree of the District Court, refusing the injunction and dismissing the bill. In argument it is contended that the question decided by the Postmaster General was that the substance which the appellant was selling did not produce the results claimed for it, that this, on the record, was a matter of opinion as to which there was conflict of evidence, and that therefore the case is within the scope of American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 33. Without considering whether such a state of facts would bring the case within the decision cited, it is sufficient to say that the question really decided by the lower courts was, not that the substance which appellant was selling was entirely worthless as a medicine, as to which there was some conflict in the evidence, but that it was so far from being the panacea which he was advertising it through the mails to be, that by so advertising it he was perpetrating a fraud upon the public. This was a question of fact which the statutes cited committed to the decision of the Postmaster General, and the applicable, settled rule of law is that the \n\n[258 U.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n conclusion of a head of an executive department on such a question, when committed to him by law, will not be reviewed by the courts where it is fairly arribed at and has substantial evidence to support it, so that it cannot justly be said to be palpably wrong and therefore arbitrary.

Ct. 352, and cases cited.\n An examination of the record fully justifies the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that it not only fails to show that the Postmaster General had no warrant of law for his order but that, on the contrary, it shows there was abundant ground for it. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n The statute under which fraud orders are issued by the Postmaster General has been decided or said to be valid so many times that it may be too late to expect a contrary decision. But there are considerations against it that seem to me never to have been fully weighed and that I think it my duty to state.\n The transmission of letters by any general means other than the postoffice is forbidden by the Criminal Code,  183-185 (Comp. St.  10353-10355). Therefore, if these prohibitions are valid, this form of communication with people at a distance is through the postoffice alone; and notwithstanding all modern inventions letters still are the principal means of speech with those who are not before our face. I do not suppose that anyone would say that the freedom of written speech is less protected by the First Amendment than the freedom of spoken words. Therefore I cannot \n\n[258 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n understand by what authority Congress undertakes to authorize anyone to determine in advance, on the grounds before us, that certain words shall not be uttered. Even those who interpret the Amendment most strictly agree that it was intended to prevent previous restraints. We have not before us any question as to how far Congress may go for the safety of the nation. The question is only whether it may amke possible irreparable wrongs and the ruin of a business in the hope of preventing some cases of a private wrong that generally is accomplished without the aid of the mail. Usually private swindling does not depend upon the postoffice. If the execution of this law does not abridge freedom of speech I do not quite see what could be said to do so.\n Even if it should be held that the prohibition of other modes of carrying letters was unconstitutional, as suggested in a qualified way in Matter of Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, it would not get rid of the difficulty to my mind, because the practical dependence of the public upon the postoffice would remain. But the decision in that case admits that possibly at least the prohibition as to letters would be valid. That case was not dealing with sealed letters. The decisions thus far have gone largely if not wholly on the ground that if the Government chose to offer a means of transportation which it was not bound to offer it could choose what it would transport; which is well enough when neither law nor the habit that the Government's action has generated has made that means the only one. But when habit and law combine to exclude every other it seems to me that the First Amendment in terms forbids such control of the post as was exercised here. I think it abridged freedom of speech on the part of the sender of the letters and that the appellant had such an interest in the exercise of their right that he could avail himself of it in this case.

STOCKTON(1922)\nNo. 16\nArgued: October 5, 1922Decided: October 16, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 3, 4]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for petitioner.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 3, 6]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Maurice Bower Saul, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether the Income Tax Law of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 756), as amended by the Act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat. 300), requires the Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital, a corporation of Pennsylvania, created for charitable uses and purposes, no part of whose net income is for the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, to pay a tax on the income of a residuary estate devised to it by the will of Alexander J. Derbyshire in 1879 and inuring to its benefit under the following circumstances: The devise was subject to the payment of certain annuities. All of the annuitants are dead save one. The Supreme Court of that state decided that the income could not be paid outright to the Hospital until the death of all the annuitants, and until then must remain in control of the trustee appointed under the will. Derbyshire's Estate, 239 Pa. 389, 86 Atl. 878. The trustee transferred the whole residuary \n\n[260 U.S. 3, 7]\n\u00a0\n fund as a loan for 15 years to the Hospital, and secured himself by mortgage on property of the Hospital. Under the terms of the loan and mortgage, the Hospital only pays interest enough to satisfy the administrative charges and the annuity. It uses the remainder of the income from the fund for its expenses. It is thus actually receiving the full benefit of the income of $15,000 from the residuary fund, reduced only by the annuity of $800.\n Section 2b of the Income Tax Law of 1916, supra (Comp. St.  6336b), is as follows:\n'Income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement of the estate, shall be subject to the normal and additional tax and taxed to their estates, and also such income of estates or any kind of property held in trust, including such income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons, or persons with contingent interests, and income held for future distribution under the terms of the will or trust shall be likewise taxed, the tax in each instance, except when the income is returned for the purpose of the tax by the beneficiary, to be assessed to the executor, administrator, or trustee, as the case may be: Provided, that where the income is to be distributed annually or regularly between existing heirs or legatees, or beneficiaries the rate of tax and method of computing the same shall be based in each case upon the amount of the individual share to be distributed.'\n\n Section 11(a) of the same act (Comp. St.  6336k) provides:\n'That there shall not be taxed under this title any income received by any ... corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.'\n\n Upon these facts, Lederer, the internal revenue collector, assessed Stockton, the trustee, on the income from \n\n[260 U.S. 3, 8]\n\u00a0\n the residuary estate for the years 1916 and 1917, under section 2b, and collected the same. The trustee brought suit in the United States District Court against the collector to recover the sums so paid as illegally collected. The District Court gave judgment for the trustee, and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 266 Fed. 676.\n This residuary fund was vested in the Hospital. The death of the annuitant would completely end the trust. For this reason, the trustee was able safely to make the arrangement by which the Hospital has really received the benefit of the income subject to the annuity. As the Hospital is admitted to be a corporation, whose income when received is exempted from taxation under section 11(a), we see no reason why the exemption should not be given effect under the circumstances. To allow the technical formality of the trust, which does not prevent the Hospital from really enjoying the income would be to defeat the beneficent purpose of Congress.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEMKE v. FARMERS' GRAIN CO. OF EMBDEN, N.D.(1922)\nNo. 456\nArgued: November 14, 1921Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Seth W. Richardson, of Fargo, N. D., for appellants.\n Mr. David F. Simpson, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the complainant, a co-operative association incorporated under the laws of North Dakota, and engaged in the business of operating a public elevator and warehouse for the purchase, sale, distribution and storage of wheat, oats, rye, barley, seeds and flax at the village of Embden in that state. The association retains no profit. If there is a surplus over operating expenses at the close of the season, such surplus is distributed among the grain growers according to the amount sold by each. The purpose of the suit is to enjoin the enforcement of the North Dakota Grain Grading and Inspection Act, passed February 11, 1919, chapter 138, North Dakota Laws 1919. The bill omitting allegations \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n as to certain federal statutes which have become obsolete, is based upon two grounds: First. That the state statute is an unlawful regulation of and burden upon interstate commerce and, therefore, violates the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. Second. That the state statute is in conflict with the Federal Grain Standards Act of August 11, 1916, chapter 313, 39 Stats. 482, 485 (Comp. St.  8747 1\/2-8747 1\/2k).\n Upon filing its bill complainant moved for a temporary injunction, which application was heard before three Federal Judges. A motion to dismiss the suit was also filed. The court denied this motion and granted a temporary injunction, finding that the North Dakota law imposed a substantial burden upon interstate commerce, and was in conflict with the Federal Grain Standards Act. Afterwards an answer was filed by the Attorney General of North Dakota on behalf of all the defendants, and later a separate answer was filed on behalf of Ladd and McGovern, officials charged with the execution of the state laws. Upon trial the District Court denied the injunction, and held that the state statute did not place a burden upon interstate commerce, and was not in conflict with the Federal Grain Standards Act, and entered a decree accordingly, from which appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That court reversed the decree of the District Court, held the state statute unconstitutional, and invalid as in conflict with the federal statute, and directed the issuance of a permanent injunction to prevent the enforcement of the state law. 273 Fed. 635.\n At the threshold we are met with a question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decree of the District Court. It is well settled that when the jurisdiction of the District Court rests solely upon an attack upon a state statute because of its alleged violation of the Federal Constitution, a direct appeal to this court is the only method of review. Section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, \n240 U.S. 305\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 293, and cases cited. It is equally well settled that where the jurisdiction is invoked upon other federal grounds, as well as the one attacking the constitutionality of a statute of a state, an appeal may be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with ultimate review in this court if the cause is within a class within our jurisdiction. In our view the case falls within the class permitting appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Section 24, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), gives to the District Court jurisdiction of cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. The attack upon the state statute because of its repugnancy to the federal statute required a consideration and construction of both statutes, and their application to the facts found. These considerations presented a ground of jurisdiction arising under a law of the United States, and was not dependent solely upon the application and construction of the Federal Constitution. Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 376; City of Pomona v. Sunset Co., \n224 U.S. 330\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 477. We, therefore, hold that the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the cause.\n We pass to a consideration of the merits. The record discloses that North Dakota is a great grain-growing State producing annually large crops, particularly wheat, for transportation beyond its borders. Complainant, and other buyers of like character, are owners of elevators and purchasers of grain bought in North Dakota to be shipped to and sold at terminal markets in other States, the principal markets being at Minneapolis and Duluth. There is practically no market in North Dakota for the grain purchased by complainant. The Minneapolis prices are received at the elevator of the complainant from Minneapolis four times daily, and are posted for the information of those interested. To these figures the buyer adds the freight and his 'spread,' or margin, of profit. The \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n purchases are generally made with the intention of shipping the grain to Minneapolis. The grain is placed in the elevator for shipment and loaded at once upon cars for shipment to Minneapolis and elsewhere outside the State of North Dakota. The producers know the basis upon which the grain is bought, but whoever pays the highest price gets the grain, Minneapolis, Duluth or elsewhere. This method of purchasing, shipment and sale is the general and usual course of business in the grain trade at the elevator of complainant and others similarly situated. The market for grain bought at Embden is outside the State of North Dakota, and it is an unusual thing to get an offer from a point within the State. After the grain is loaded upon the cars it is generally consigned to a commission merchant at Minneapolis. At the terminal market the grain is inspected and graded by inspectors licensed under federal law.\n That such course of dealing constitutes interstate commerce, there can be no question. This court has so held in many cases, and we have had occasion to discuss and decide the nature of such commerce in a case closely analogous in its facts, and altogether so in principle, Dahnke Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, decided December 12, 1921, \n257 U.S. 282\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 106. In that case the facts disclose that a company organized in Tennessee and carrying on business there, went into Kentucky and, through an agent there, bought wheat for shipment to the company's mill in Tennessee. The state court held that the transaction was merely a purchase of wheat in Kentucky, and made the Tennessee company amenable to the regulatory statutes of the State. This court rejected the conclusion of the state court, and held that the buying, no less than the selling of grain under such circumstances was was a part of interstate commerce, committed to national control by the Federal Constitution. Applying the principle of that decision, and the previous decisions \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n of this court cited in the opinion, the complainant's course of dealing in the buying of grain, which it purchased and sold under the circumstances as herein disclosed, was interstate commerce. Being such, the State could not regulate the business by a statute which had the effect to control and burden interstate commerce.\n Nor is this conclusion opposed by cases decided in this court and relied upon by appellants, in which we have had occasion to define the line between state and federal authority under facts presented which required a definition of interstate commerce where the right of state taxation was involved, or manufacture or commerce of an intrastate character was the subject of consideration. In those cases we have defined the beginning of interstate commerce as that time when goods begin their interstate journey by delivery to a carrier or otherwise, thus passing beyond state authority into the domain of federal control. Cases of that type are not in conflict with principles recognized as controlling here. None of them indicates, much less decides, that interstate commerce does not include the buying and selling of products for shipment beyond state lines. It is true, as appellants contend, that after the wheat was delivered at complainant's elevator, or loaded on the cars for shipment, it might have been diverted to a local market or sent to a local mill. But such was not the course of business. The testimony shows that practically all the wheat purchased by the complainant was for shipment to and sale in the Minneapolis market. That was the course of business, and fixed and determined the interstate character of the transactions. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276; Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, decided by this court December 12, 1921, \n257 U.S. 265\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 101, and United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, decided the same day, \n257 U.S. 277\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 105.\n In view of this state of facts we come to inquire whether the North Dakota statute is a regulation of interstate \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n commerce, and, therefore, beyond the legislative power of the State. Pertinent parts of the Act are stated in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This Act shows a comprehensive scheme to regulate the buying of grain. Such purchases can only be made by those who hold licenses from the State, pay state charges for the same, and act under a system of grading, inspecting \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n and weighing fully defined in the act. Furthermore, the grain can only be purchased subject to the power of the State Grain Inspector to determine the margin of profit which the buyer shall realize upon his purchase. This authority is conferred in section 23, and the margin of profit is defined to be the difference between the price paid at the North Dakota elevator and the market price, \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 58]\n\u00a0\n with an allowance for freight, at the Minnesota points to which the grain is shipped and sold. That is, the State officer may fix and determine the price to be paid for grain which is bought, shipped, and sold in interstate commerce. That this is a regulation of interstate commerce, is obvious from its mere statement.\n Nor will it do to say that the state law acts before the interstate transaction begins. It seizes upon the grain and controls its purchase at the beginning of interstate commerce. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Clark Brothers Coal Mining Co., \n238 \nU.S. 456, 468\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 896\n\n\n It is contended that these regulations may stand upon the principles recognized in decisions of this court which permit the State to make local laws under its police power in the interest of the welfare of its people, which are valid \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 59]\n\u00a0\n although affecting interstate commerce, and may stand, at least until Congress takes possession of the field under its superior authority to regulate commerce among the States. This principle has no application where the State passes beyond the exercise of its legitimate authority, and undertakes to regulate interstate commerce by imposing burdens upon it. This court stated the principle and its limitations in the discussion of the subject in the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. In the course of the opinion in that case, we said (230 U. S. p. 400, 33 Sup. Ct. 740, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18):\n'The principle, which determines this classification [between federal and state power], underlies the doctrine that the States cannot under any guise impose direct burdens upon interstate commerce. For this is but to hold that the States are not permitted directly to regulate or restrain that which from its nature should be under the control of the one authority and be free from restriction save as it is governed in the manner that the national legislature constitutionally ordains.\n\n'Thus, the States cannot tax interstate commerce, either by laying the tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it, or upon the receipts, as such, derived from it (State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, \n120 U.S. 489\n; Philadelphia & Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 U.S. 326\n; Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 U.S. 640\n; McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n; Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 U.S. 289\n; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Kansas. \n216 U.S. 1\n; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 56; Meyer v. Wells Fargo & Company, \n223 U.S. 298\n; Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 U.S. 389\n). ...'\n\n Applying the principle here, the statute denies the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce except to dealers licensed by state authority, and provides a system which enables state officials to fix the profit which may be made in dealing with a subject of interstate commerce.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 50, 60]\n\u00a0\n It is insisted that the price fixing feature of the statute may be ignored, and its other regulatory features of inspection and grading sustained if not contrary to valid federal regulations of the same subject. But the features of this act, clearly regulatory of interstate commerce, are essential and vital parts of the general plan of the statute to control the purchase of grain and to determine the profit at which it may be sold. It is apparent that without these sections the State Legislature would not have passed the act. Without their enforcement the plan and scope of the act fails of accomplishing its manifest purpose. We have no authority to eliminate an essential feature of the law for the purpose of saving the constitutionality of parts of it. International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 113\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103, and cases cited.\n Nor is the appellants' contention upheld by the decision of this court in Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 U.S. 365\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 114. In that case this court sustained the constitutionality of a statute of Missouri providing that in cities having more than seventy- five thousand inhabitants buildings used for the storage of grain shall be deemed public warehouses; and prohibiting the issue of weight certificates by other than authorized bonded state weighers. We held that the state statute did not violate the due process clause or the interstate commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Furthermore, it was held that the Act, under the facts of that case, did not violate the United States Grain Standards Act as the latter did not regulate weighing; and, for reasons stated, did not violate the United States Warehouse Act (Comp. St.  8747 3\/4-8747 3\/4 pp). The Act, there in question, did not undertake to regulate the buying of grain in interstate commerce, nor to levy a license tax upon the privilege, nor to fix the profit which could be realized on grain bought, shipped, and sold in interstate commerce.\n It is alleged that such legislation is in the interest of the grain growers and essential to protect them from \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 61]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent purchases, and to secure payment to them of fair prices for the grain actually sold. This may be ture, but Congress is amply authorized to pass measures to protect interstate commerce if legislation of that character is needed. The supposed inconveniences and wrongs are not to be redressed by sustaining the constitutionality of laws which clearly encroach upon the field of interstate commerce placed by the Constitution under federal control.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that this legislation is beyond the power of the State as it is a regulation of interstate commerce when applied to complainant's business. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider whether the provisions of the State act are in contravention of the regulations provided in the Federal Grain Standards Act as was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur.\n The United States Grain Standards Act of August 11, 1916, c. 313, pt. B, 39 Stat. 482, 483, authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards (or grades) of quality and condition for different kinds of grain and provides that when such standards shall have been established, shipment of any such grain for sale by grade in interstate commerce is prohibited, unless the grain has either been inspected before shipment or is to be inspected en route or at destination, by an inspector licensed under the federal act. Shipment without such inspection is permitted whenever the sale is by sample or by some description other than the official grade. The act does not purport to deal in any way with sales in intrastate commerce. \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 62]\n\u00a0\n In 1919 the Legislature of North Dakota concluded that its farmers were being systematically defrauded in purchases of their grain made within the State. The buyers were largely local mills, of which there are 160, and local elevators, of which there are 2,200. The fraud was perpetrated, in part, by underweighing and undergrading in the unofficial inspection of the grain made locally by or on behalf of the purchasers. In part, the fraud was perpetrated by means of unconscionable bargains made locally, through which valuable dockage was obtained from the farmer without any payment therefor or by which the grain itself was bought at less than its fair value. Against such frauds the federal act did not purport to afford any protection. So far as the transactions were wholly intrastate Congress was without power to do so. So far as the sales were part of transactions in interstate commerce the power was ample; but Congress did not see fit to exert it. And the Secretary of Agriculture did not even exercise his authority to provide for federal inspection and grading within North Dakota of such grain as was shipped from there in interstate commerce. That was left by him to be done after the grain reached Minnesota or other States.\n To protect the North Dakota farmer against these frauds practiced by local buyers its Legislature enacted chapter 138 of the Laws of 1919. The statute seeks to effect protection (a) by establishing a system of state inspection, grading and weighing; (b) by prohibiting any one from purchasing grain before it is inspected, graded and weighed (except that one producer may buy from another); (c) by ascertaining in the course of inspection, grading and weighing, the amount of dockage, and requiring a purchaser of the grain either to pay separately for the dockage or to return the same to the farmer; (d) by requiring payment to the farmer of the fair value of grain-the value to be \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 63]\n\u00a0\n ascertained by fixing the so-called margin; (e) by insuring compliance with the above provisions through the further provision that only persons or concerns licensed to inspect, grade and weigh may buy grain before it has been officially inspected. The standards of quality and condition established by the Secretary of Agriculture were adopted under regulations issued by the State Inspector of Grades, Weights and Measures; and all state inspectors (including licensed buyers) were required to observe those grades.\n Ordinarily when a state's police power is exerted in connection with sales it is the buyer whom the law seeks to protect; and the seller is licensed as part of the machinery to enforce the regulations prescribed. I cannot doubt that the State has power as broad to protect the seller and, to that end, to license the buyer. Compare House v. Mayes, \n219 U.S. 270\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 234. Ordinarily the function of inspection, grading and measurement is committed to a public official or other impartial person. But I am not aware of any constitutional objection to imposing the duty upon the buyer, where conditions demand it. The requirement that the amount of the dockage shall be ascertained and that it shall be paid for separately or be returned, does not differ in principle from the requirement upheld in McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 539\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 206, that coal shall be measured before screening, or the requirement upheld in Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 U.S. 13\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 1, that store orders shall be redeemed in cash, or that upheld in House v. Mayes, supra, which prohibited, in the purchase of grain, making arbitrary deductions from the actual weight. The requirement that the buyer shall take only a proper margin for graded grain is, in effect, requiring that he pay a fair price. Laws designed to prevent unfair prices are ordinarily enacted to protect consumers. But there is no constitutional objection to protecting producers against unconscionable bargains, if conditions \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 64]\n\u00a0\n are such that it is they who require protection. Nor can there be any constitutional objection to using, as a factor in determining what is fair, the price prevailing in terminal markets-even if they happen to be located in another State.\n Whether the purchases involved in this case were intrastate or interstate commerce we need not decide. For the fact that a sale or purchase is part of a transaction in interstate commerce does not preclude application of state inspection laws, unless Congress has occupied the field or the state regulation directly burdens interstate commerce. That neither of these exceptions applies here appears from the description of the operation of the federal and the state laws given below in the opinion of Judge Amidon. Compare Savage v. Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715; Merchants Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 U.S. 365\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 114; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, \n249 U.S. 427\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 325; Crescent Cotton Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 U.S. 129\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 42; and New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 156, note 1, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139. The requirement of a license and the payment of a $10 license fee, if applied to nonresidents not regularly engaged in buying grain within the State might perhaps be obnoxious to the Commerce Clause. But the objection, if sound, would not afford this plaintiff ground for attacking the validity of the statute. Lee v. New Jersey, \n207 U.S. 67\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 22. It is a North Dakota corporation, owner of an elevator within the State, and is carrying on business there under the laws of the State as a public warehouseman. Compare Brass v. Stoeser, \n153 \nU.S. 391, 394\n, 396 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 857. It is possible also that some provision in the license or some regulation issued by the State Inspector is obnoxious to the Commerce Clause. If so a licensee may disregard it. W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 423. Even if the margin clause should be held a burden upon interstate commerce, still that would not invalidate the whole statute. The margin clause is separable from the other provisions \n\n[258 U.S. 50, 65]\n\u00a0\n of the act; and it could be eliminated without affecting the operation of any other feature of the state system. Compare Presser v. Illinois, \n116 U.S. 252\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 580; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 U.S. 642\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 606. And it is clear that the Legislature would have wished to secure the protection afforded by the other provisions, if this one should be held to be beyond the power of the State. That it was not the purpose of Congress to supersede state inspection and grading acts is made manifest by section 29 of the United States Grain Standards Act (39 Stat. p. 490). Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, supra, 248 U. S. p. 368, 39 Sup. Ct. 114.\n To strike down this inspection law, instead of limiting the sphere of its operation, seems to me a serious curtailment of the functions of the State and leaves the farmers of North Dakota defenseless against what are asserted to be persistent, palpable frauds. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Authority is given to a State Inspector appointed by the Governor,--\n (a) To appoint a Chief Deputy Inspector of Grades, Weights and Measures; a Chief Elevator Accountant; Deputy Inspector of Grades, Weights and Measures; State Deputy Inspector of Grades, Weights and Measures, and Warehouse Inspectors;\n (b) To issue licenses to warehouses, buyers and solicitors of grain and other agricultural products;\n (c) To establish uniform grades for grain, etc., for the State of North Dakota; To alter and modify such grades;\n (d) To establish uniform grade certificates used in marketing the grain, etc.;\n (e) To hear and determine appeals from State Deputy Inspectors and from Deputy Inspectors of Grades, Weights, and Measures;\n (f) To conduct investigations in regard to marketing, grading, and weighing of grain, etc.;\n (i) To establish a reasonable margin to be paid producers of grain by warehouses, elevators and mills;\n (j) To fix and determine all charges for grading, inspecting and weighing grain, etc.;\n (k) To make rules, etc., to carry out the provisions of the Act.\n Sec. 3.

Randolph, citizens of Maryland, applied for and were granted registration as qualified voters in Baltimore City. To have their names stricken from the list Oscar Leser and others brought this suit in the court of common pleas. The only ground of disqualification alleged was that the applicants for registration were women, whereas the Constitution of Maryland limits the suffrage to men. Ratification of the proposed amendment to the federal \n\n[258 U.S. 130, 136]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, now known as the Nineteenth, 41 Stat. 362, had been proclaimed on August 26, 1920, 41 Stat. 1823, pursuant to Revised Statutes ,  205 (Comp. St.  303). The Legislature of Maryland had refused to ratify it. The petitioners contended, on several grounds, that the amendment had not become part of the federal Constitution. The trial court overruled the contentions and dismissed the petition. Its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the state (Md.) 114 Atl. 840; and the case comes here on writ of error. That writ must be dismissed; but the petition for a writ of certiorari, also duly filed, is granted. The laws of Maryland authorize such a suit by a qualified voter against the board of registry. Whether the Nineteenth Amendment has become part of the federal Constitution is the question presented for decision.\n The first contention is that the power of amendment conferred by the federal Constitution and sought to be exercise does not extend to this amendment because of its character. The argument is that so great an addition to the electorate, if made without the state's consent, destroys its autonomy as a political body. This amendment is in character and phraseology precisely similar to the Fifteenth. For each the same method of adoption was pursued. One cannot be valid and the other invalid. That the Fifteenth is valid, although rejected by six states, including Maryland, has been recognized and acted on for half a century. See United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n; Neale v. Delaware, \n103 U.S. 370\n; Guinn v. United States, \n238 U.S. 347\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 926, L. R. A. 1916A, 1124; Myers v. Anderson, \n238 U.S. 368\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 932. The suggestion that the Fifteenth was incorporated in the Constitution, not in accordance with law, but practically as a war measure which has been validated by acquiescence, cannot be entertained.\n The second contention is that in the Constitutions of several of the 36 states named in the proclamation \n\n[258 U.S. 130, 137]\n\u00a0\n of the Secretary of State there are provisions which render inoperative the alleged ratifications by their Legislatures. The argument is thst by reason of these specific provisions the Legislatures were without power to ratify. But the function of a state Legislature in ratifying a proposed amendment to the federal Constitution, like the function of Congress in proposing the amendment, is a federal function derived from the federal Constitution; and it transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the people of a state. Hawke v. Smith, No. 1, \n253 U.S. 221\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 495, 10 A. L. R. 1504; Hawke v. Smith, No. 2, \n253 U.S. 231\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 498; National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 386\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 588.\n The remaining contention is that the ratifying resolutions of Tennessee and of West Virginia are inoperative, because adopted in violation of the rules of legislative procedure prevailing in the respective states. The question raised may have been rendered immaterial by the fact that since the proclamation the Legislatures of two other states-Connecticut and Vermont-have adopted resolutions of ratification. But a broader answer should be given to the contention. The proclamation by the Secretary certified that from official documents on file in the Department of State it appeared that the proposed amendment was ratified by the Legislatures of 36 states, and that it 'has become valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution of the United States.' As the Legislatures of Tennessee and of West Virginia had power to adopt the resolutions of ratification, official notice to the Secretary, duly authenticated, that they had done so, was conclusive upon him, and, being certified to by his proclamation, is conclusive upon the courts. The rule declared in Field v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 669-673, 12 Sup. Ct. 495, is applicable here. See, also Harwood v. Wentworth, \n162 \nU.S. 547, 562\n, 16 S. Sup.

Mount, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Henry Amerman, of New York City, for appellee Johnson. \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a controversy between the appellant, Levinson, and Johnson, one of the appellees, as to which of the two is entitled to the steam yacht Wadena. The yacht had been taken for the purposes of the late war and subsequently was offered for public sale by the Secretary of the Navy in pursuance of an Executive Order of January 7, \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 200]\n\u00a0\n 1919, authorized by the Act of March 3, 1883, c. 141,  5, 22 Stat. 599 ( Comp. St.  2787). Levinson sent in a bid complying with the terms of the offer, was declared the highest bidder and sent his check for the residue above the required deposit. Thereupon he received a bill of sale under the seal of the Department dated September 3, 1919, acknowledging that he had become the legal purchaser and had paid the price, and stating that the vessel 'is hereby delivered to and declared to be the property of the said Morris Levinson.' On September 8 it was discovered that Johnson had sent in a higher bid which had been misplaced and overlooked. After making the discovery the Navy Department refused to give up the Wadena to Levinson and attempted to rescind the transaction with him. He insisted on his rights and Johnson on his side offered to pay the amount of his bid and also demanded delivery of the yacht. The United States thereupon brought the present bill to determine the rights of the parties, and although it did not stand indifferent and has endeavored to maintain Johnson's right and so to set the higher price, not to speak of Levinson's claim in contract, still as all parties consented to the jurisdiction we do not feel called upon to raise a question upon that score. See McGowan v. Parish, \n237 U.S. 285\n, 295, et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 543.\n The District Court decided in favor of Levinson. Both Johnson and the United States appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal of the United States on the ground that it was a mere stakeholder, but, one Judge dissenting, reversed the decree of the District Court and decided in favor of Johnson, on the ground that the Secretary of the Navy had no authority to accept any other than what was the highest bid in fact. 267 Fed. 692.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals construed the authority of the Secretary of the Navy too narrowly and that the decision of the District Court was right. The Act of 1883,  5, provides for an appraisal \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 201]\n\u00a0\n and an advertisement for three months setting forth the appraised value and that the vessel will be sold to the offerer of the highest price above the appraised value, etc. The section concludes:\n'But no vessel of the Navy shall hereafter be sold in any other manner than herein provided, or for less than such appraised value, unless the President of the United States shall otherwise direct in writing.'\n\n The power of the President to direct a departure from the statute is not confined to a sale for less than the appraised value but extends to the manner of the sale. The word 'unless' qualifies both the requirements of the concluding clause. The executive order seemingly so construes the statute, for it merely provides that if the former owner of the vessel will not purchase at the appraised value the Secretary of the Navy shall sell at public sale 'for such price as he shall approve.' The Secretary construed the order to like effect. He did not advertise for three months and he allowed a variation from the statute in the form of deposit required.\n It seems to us that the practices of ordinary business dealing ought so far to bind the United States that the ostensible authority given by the executive order, the Secretary's declaration that Levinson's bid was the highest, his approval of the price, and his execution of a bill of sale, should be held conclusive in favor of Levinson. The fact that the Secretary advertised that he would sell to the highest bidder could not limit his authority or diminish the effect of his acts. Even if Johnson's bid had made a contract automatically by being the highest, it would not follow that Levinson's title was bad. But a bid had no such effect, as the right to reject it was reserved. We can see no justification beyond the wish to secure a higher price, for the refusal to allow the appellant to remove his yacht. The title passed to him upon the execution of the bill of sale. Hatch v. Oil Co., \n100 U.S. 124\n, 128. \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 202]\n\u00a0\n It is suggested that there is no longer a question before the Court because it is said that the District Court entered a decree in pursuance of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals and that the Navy Department thereupon delivered the yacht to Johnson. This was a further departure from the position of stakeholder assumed by the United States but cannot affect the decree to be entered upon its bill. It is urged for Johnson that there was a mistake that relieved the Government. There was no mistake that Levinson had anything to do with or that would warrant a court of equity in requiring him to give up the title that he acquired.\n Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE was absent and took no part in the decision.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissenting.\n The opinion in my view, gives too much prominence to the action of the Navy Department and, in effect, determines the case by it as if the controversy were between the Department and Levinson, and not between him and Johnson. It caused the controversy, indeed, and by its mistake gave a right to Levinson to which Johnson was entitled. Has the law no redress for the injury thus inflicted? It would be a reproach to it if it have not.\n Let me repeat the facts. In pursuance of a statute, and in the manner directed by it, the Navy Department offered the yacht Wadena for sale. It was the duty of the Department to the Government, of which it was an instrument to accept the highest bid, and it owed a duty as well to him who should be the highest bidder. Johnson responded to the offer of sale and his bid was the highest. By mistake, however, the bid was assigned to a boat of similar name. In consequence of the mistake Levinson was considered the highest bidder and a bill of sale was issued to him. Before the delivery of the yacht, however, \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 203]\n\u00a0\n the mistake was discovered and the yacht was retained by the Department. This being the situation, the Department, not in its own interest, not in partiality to either claimant, caused this suit to be brought that the rights of the claimants could be adjudicated. The suit is a disclaimer of interest or favor; it is in the nature of a bill of interpleader and the contest is remitted to the interpleaded, Levinson and Johnson, and the law of their rights. And that law is dependent upon what they did, not upon what the Navy Department did-by the priorities between them, not by a chance advantage. These are the elements that should determine judgment, whether we assign to accident or mistake the action of the Department in declaring Levinson to be the purchaser of the yacht. I need not dwell upon the sufficiency of either as a ground of relief.\n Accident is said to be one of the oldest heads of equity jurisdiction and a learned authority says its first and principal requisite is that, by an event not expected nor one party has without fault and undesignedly undergone some legal loss while another party has acquired a legal right, which it is contrary to good conscience for him to retain and enforce. 2 Pomeroy,  824.\n The requisites and consequences are in this case, and exhibit the relative situations and rights of Levinson and Johnson. Levinson has acquired a right to which Johnson was entitled and which Johnson lost by an accident to which he was not a contributor. The law in its sufficiency and prudence meets such contingent happening and gives a remedy to prevent or redress its injury. That Levinson was given a bill of sale is not a serious deterrent. As the bill of sale could have been refused it can be disregarded as an element of decision.\n Mistake as well as accident (mistake may be considered a corollary of accident) is a ground of relief which the law's remedial consideration furnishes for the redress of \n\n[258 U.S. 198, 204]\n\u00a0\n injustice. And that a mistake was made cannot be denied, and to which no act or negligence of Johnson was accessory. He responded to the solicitation of the Navy Department executing the law, and he was entitled to the preference that the law commanded. It was given to another by mistake. The law will not permit him to retain it, and this is a necessary deduction, I confidently believe and, therefore, confidently express, though it is opposed by the judgment of my brethren. I repeat, that there was a mistake cannot be disputed, and I cannot think that its consummation protects it from correction and that a remedy should be denied because it is needed, all of its conditions existing.\n It was the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals in a well reasoned opinion that the Secretary of the Navy had 'no authority to deliver the bill of sale to Levinson' but was 'bound to deliver it to Johnson.' There is much to sustain the decision; I, however, base my dissent upon the views that I have expressed, and think that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEVY v. WARDELL(1922)\nNo. 303\nArgued: April 18, 1922Decided: May 1, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 542, 543]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward F. Treadwell and Garret W. McEnerney, both of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case was determined in the court below upon demurrer to the complaint. The complaint alleged that on the 19th day of December, 1902, and for some time prior thereto, Henriette Levy was the owner of 22,014 shares of the capital stock of the Levy Estate Company, a corporation. On that date she conveyed to the plaintiffs Harriet L. Levy, Pauline Jacobs, and Adeline Salinger, each 5,000 shares of that stock. On the 14th day of January, 1903, she conveyed to these plaintiffs 2,660 shares each.\n On the 17th day of January, 1907, she and the plaintiffs entered into an agreement, which recited errors made in the issue of the stock, and agreed that the number of shares to which each was entitled was as follows: To Henriette Levy 10 shares, to Harriet L. Levy 7,328 shares, to Pauline Jacobs 7,338 shares, to Adeline Salinger 7,337 shares, and to Ruth Salinger 1 share.\n On the same date the agreement was carried out by the board of directors of the company, and on that date Henriette Levy conveyed her 10 shares to Harriet L. Levy.\n The transfers of the stock to plaintiffs were complete, and there were no agreements or stipulations by which Henriette Levy would be entitled to a return of the stock, except that the plaintiffs promised and agreed to pay to her the dividends accruing thereon during her lifetime, \n\n[258 U.S. 542, 544]\n\u00a0\n she, however, retaining no testamentary disposition or any legal right whatsoever over the stock, or any of it, or any right of revocation.\n Henriette Levy at the time of the transfers was in good health, and made them to get rid of the care and worry of business, and to vest in plaintiffs definite and irrevocable present rights of ownership in the stock, and the transfers were not in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, her death.\n She died on the 15th day of December, 1916, being at that time, and at the time of the transfers, a resident of Alameda county, Cal. Plaintiffs are her surviving children, and were at such time, and are now, residents of the state.\n She left no property or estate or assets whatever, and consequently there was no estate to administer, nor any estate upon which any tax could be levied. Notwithstanding the facts, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States, assuming to act under the provisions of the Act of September 8, 1916 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/2a-6336 1\/2m), attempted to levy and assess a tax in the sum of $12,460.84, and demanded and threatened to enforce payment of the same. In consequence thereof the plaintiffs paid the tax. Subsequently they demanded a refund of the tax, which demand was refused.\n At the time of the transfers there was no law of the state of California imposing any transfer or inheritance tax, nor was there a law of the United States to that effect, and all of the transfers were intended to take effect in possession and enjoyment upon their date. The act of Congress, therefore should not be construed to be retroactive, and, if so construed, was in violation of the Constitution of the United States, in that it would take the property of plaintiffs without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and would not be, besides, \n\n[258 U.S. 542, 545]\n\u00a0\n a transfer tax or an indirect tax, but would be a direct tax thereon, in violation of article 1, section 9, subdivision 4, of the Constitution of the United States, because not laid in proper relation to census or enumeration as therein provided.\n Judgment was prayed for the sum of $12,460.84, with interest from the 26th day of December, 1917\n\n\n Wardell filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was sustained, and the action dismissed. To that judgment this writ of error is directed. For the reasons stated in Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 U.S. 529\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 391, 66 L. Ed.-, we think the judgment was erroneous.\n There was a proceeding in the case to which we must give attention. The judgment of dismissal was entered January 20, 1921. On February 14, 1921, an order of the court was made and entered which recited the resignation of Wardell as collector, and the appointment of John L. Flynn as collector, and as doubts existed as to whether the case was proper for the substitution of Flynn as successor of Wardell, it was ordered that so far as the action was against Wardell in his official capacity the same might be maintained against Flynn, and that so far as it was against Wardell personally it might be continued against him personally, without further pleadings or process.\n On February 15, 1921, Flynn entered his appearance, which, after reciting the fact of his substitution as defendant in place of Wardell, in so far as the action was against Wardell in his official capacity, declared that he (Flynn) appeared in the 'action as such defendant.'\n It will be observed that there was no resistance by Flynn to his substitution, and the subsequent proceedings were directed as much against him as against Wardell; the bond upon the writ of error running to both. As we have said, however, in Union Trust Co. et al. v. Wardell and Flynn ( No. 236) \n258 U.S. 537\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 393, 66 L. Ed.-, this court decided in Smietanka, Collector, v. Indiana Steel Co., 257 \n\n[258 U.S. 542, 546]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 1, 42 Sup. Ct. 1, October 24th of this term, that an action could not be maintained against a collector of internal revenue for the recovery of a tax in the collection and disbursement of which he had no agency.\n This was Flynn's situation, and bringing him into the case was error. Therefore, upon return of the case to the District Court, he shall be permitted to set up the defense of nonliability, if so advised, and, if he set up the defense, it shall be ruled as sufficient for the reasons we have given.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIBERTY OIL CO. v. CONDON NAT. BANK(1922)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: November 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 235, 237]\n\u00a0\n This suit was begun as an action at law in the District Court of Kansas by the Liberty Oil Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, and a citizen of that state, against the Condon National Bank, a corporation organized under the banking laws of the United States and resident and doing business in Kansas. Plaintiff by its petition averred that it had made a contract with the Atlas Petroleum Company of Oklahoma, C. M. Ball, Isadore Litman, P. G. Keith, and J. H. Keith, residents of Kansas, by which it agreed to purchase and they agreed to sell 160 acres, more or less, of oil lands in Butler county, Kansas, for $1,150,000. By the contract, the purchaser was required to deposit $100,000 with the Condon National Bank simultaneously with a deposit of the contract, and this sum, together with the assignments, transfers, and conveyances under the contract, was to be held by the bank and by it to be delivered in accordance with the conditions of the contract. The main conditions, and the only ones here material, were that the vendors should furnish an abstract of the title to the property contracted to be sold, showing a good and marketable title in them, that the vendee should have seven days in which to examine the abstract, and that, if its examination should show a good and marketable title, the vendee should pay the bank $1,050,000, the remainder of the purchase money, and the bank should deliver the deeds of assignment and transfers to the vendee, and the vendor should deliver possession of the land. If the examination showed a good and marketable title, and the vendee should refuse to pay the money then due from it, the $ 100,000 was to be delivered to the vendors as liquidated damages, and the contract was to become null and void. In the event that the examination should disclose that the title was not good and marketable, the vendee was to notify the vendors, and they were to have 30 days in which to perfect the title, and should they neglect in that time to do so the $100,000 on \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 238]\n\u00a0\n deposit was to be returned to the vendee, and the contract was to become null and void.\n The petition averred that the money and the contract were deposited in the defendant bank, that the abstract of title was submitted, that an examination of the abstract submitted showed that the title of the vendors was not good and marketable, in that in the chain of title the vendors claimed under the deed of an assignee for the benefit of creditors filed in a Colorado court and taking effect by the laws of that state, but never authorized or confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction under the laws of Kansas, as required by the law of the latter state, that this defect was not remedied by the vendors within the time required by the contract and on July 11, 1918, the plaintiff duly notified the defendant bank of this and demanded payment of the money deposited, that the defendant refused and appropriated the sum to its own use to the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of $100,000 and interest at 6 per cent. from the date of the demand and refusal.\n The defendant bank answered, admitting all the facts averred in the petition, except those as to the character of the title shown by the abstract, and alleged that the vendors in the contract of sale had also demanded that the deposit of $100,000 be paid to them on the ground that the vendee had refused without right to accept a good and marketable title to the land sold, that the defendant bank had no interest in the deposit, and offered to pay the sum into court or to such person as the court should order. The defendant asked that the vendors be made parties and required to set up their claim to the deposit, that the court make proper order as to the disposition of the money, and that the defendant, upon compliance with the order, be discharged from all liability in connection therewith. The court granted the prayer of the answer and 'ordered, adjudged, and decreed' that vendors be made \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 239]\n\u00a0\n parties, and set up their claim within 20 days. The vendors waived summons and filed an answer and cross-petition, in which they averred that the petition of the plaintiff did not state a cause of action, and denied as much of the petition as averred that there were defects in the abstract of title which prevented it from being good and marketable. By the cross- petition they asked for the payment of the $100,000 deposit and also a judgment for $1,050,000 as the purchase price for the land, title to which they had tendered, and for general relief. This cross-petition the plaintiff answered, making the same issue as that in the petition and answer. A jury was waived in writing. A bill of exceptions was taken, embodying all the evidence, which was signed by the judge, and the same evidence was included in a transcript also certified to by the judge.\n The District Court on the evidence found generally for the vendors, and from its opinion it appeared that it found the title good and marketable, and that upon plaintiff's refusal to accept the same the vendors became entitled to the $100,000 as liquidated damages. Accordingly it was 'considered, ordered, and adjudged' that the vendors, interveners, recover $10,750 as interest on the $100,000 from June 30, 1918, that the Condon Bank, defendant, be discharged from further liability, and that the interveners have judgment for the $100,000 then in the registry of the court. There is nothing in the record to show that the defendant bank was dismissed until this final judgment, although, under some authority not made a matter of record, it had turned the money into the registry of the court.\n An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals and a supersedeas bond given. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the action was a suit at law, that under section 4 of the Act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 727 [ Comp. St.  1649a]), to amend the Judicial Code, it had the power and it was \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 240]\n\u00a0\n its duty to consider the appeal taken as a writ of error, and that, as the bill of exceptions showed no special findings of fact in a cause in which a jury had been waived but only a general finding for the interveners, it was not within the power of the court in a law case to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding. It therefore affirmed the judgment of the District Court. A certiorari brings the case here for consideration.\n Mr. F. W. Lehmann, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. John J. Jones, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We differ with the Circuit Court of Appeals in its holding that, as brought in review before it, this cause was an action at law. We think the cause was then equitable, and the proper review was by appeal. The case began as an action at law for money had and received. When the defendant bank claimed to be only a stakeholder of the deposit, disclaimed interest therein, and offered to pay it into court, and asked that the other claimants of the fund be made parties, its answer and cross-petition became an equitable defense and a prayer for affirmative equitable relief in the nature of a bill for interpleader. Section 274b of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of March 3, 1915, c. 90, 38 Stat. 956 (Comp. St.  1251b), provides:\n'That in all actions at law equitable defenses may be interposed by answer, plea, or replication without the necessity of filing a bill on the equity side of the court. The defendant shall have the same rights in such case as if he had filed a bill embodying the defense of seeking the relief prayed for in such answer or plea. Equitable \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 241]\n\u00a0\n relief respecting the subject matter of the suit may thus be obtained by answer or plea. In case affirmative relief is prayed in such answer or plea, the plaintiff shall file a replication. Review of the judgment or decree entered in such case shall be regulated by rule of court. Whether such review be sought by writ of error or by appeal the appellate court shall have full power to render such judgment upon the records as law and justice shall require.'\n\n This section applies to the case before us. The proceeding was changed by defendant's answer and cross-petition from one at law to one in equity with all the consequences flowing therefrom. The better practice would perhaps have been, on the defendant's filing its answer and cross- petition, to order the cause transferred to the equity side of the court. Under equity rule No. 22 (33 Sup. Ct. xxiv), a suit in equity which should have been brought at law must be transferred to the law side of the court. There is no corresponding provision in rule or statute which expressly directs this to be done when the action begun at law should have been by a bill on the equity side, but we think the power of the trial court to order a transfer in a case like this is implied from the broad language of section 274b, above quoted, by which the defendant who files an equitable defense is to be given the same rights as if he had set them up in a bill in equity, and from section 274a of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1251a), quoted below, in which the court is directed, when a suit at law should have been brought in equity, to order amendments to the pleadings necessary to confrom them to the proper practice. Webb v. Southern Ry. Co. ( D. C.) 235 Fed. 578, 593, 594. We are aware that a different conclusion has been reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit in Waldo et al. v. Wilson, 231 Fed. 654, 145 C. C. A. 540, but for the reasons stated, and after a full examination of that case, we think the conclusion of that court upon this point was too narrow. \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 242]\n\u00a0\n Nor, by the failure to order the transfer in this case, did the suit lose the equitable character it had taken on by the answer and cross- petition of the defendant. The situation thus produced was quite like that under state Civil Codes of Procedure in which there is but one form of civil action, the formal distinction between proceedings in law and equity is abolished, and remedies at law and in equity are available to the parties in the same court and the same cause. Neither legal nor equitable remedies are abolished under such Codes.\n'What was an action at law before the Code is still an action founded on legal principles; and what was a bill in equity before the Code is still a civil action founded on principles of equity.' Sutherland on Code Pleading Practice and Forms,  87; De Witt v. Hays, 2 Cal. 464, 56 Am. Dec. 352; Smith v. Rowe, 4 Cal. 6; Howard v. Tiffany, 5 N. Y. Super. Ct. 695.\n\n Section 274b is an important step toward a consolidation of the federal courts of law and equity, and the questions presented in this union are to be solved much as they have been under the state Codes. United States v. Richardson, 223 Fed. 1010, 1013, 139 C. C. A. 386. The most important limitation upon a federal union of the two kinds of remedies in one form of action is the requirement of the Constitution in the Seventh Amendment that:\n'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n\n Where an equitable defense is interposed to a suit at law, the equitable issue raised should first be disposed of as in a court of equity, and then, if an issue at law remains, it is triable to a jury. Massie v. Stradford, 17 Ohio St. 596; Dodsworth v. Hopple, 33 Ohio St. 16, 18; Taylor v. Brick Co., 66 Ohio St. 360, 366, 64 N. E. 428; Sutherland Code Pl. and Pr.  1157. The equitable defense makes the issue \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 243]\n\u00a0\n equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a chancellor. The right of trial by jury is preserved exactly as it was at common law. The same order is preserved as under the system of separate courts. If a defendant at law had an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill in equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he could make his equitable defense effective by a hearing before the chancellor. The hearing on that bill was before the chancellor, and not before a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was granted, the injunction against the sutit at law was made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. If the injunction was denied, the suit at law proceeded to verdict and judgment. This was the practice in the courts of law and chancery in England when our Constitution and the Seventh Amendment were adopted, and it is in the light of such practice that the Seventh Amendment is to be construed.\n Congress, we think, was looking toward such a union of laws and equity actions in the enactment of section 274b quoted above, and of section 274a, which, referring to courts of the United States, provides:\n'That in case any of said courts shall find that a suit at law should have been brought in equity or a suit in equity should have been brought at law, the court shall order any amendments to the pleadings which may be necessary to conform them to the proper practice. Any party to the suit shall have the right, at any stage of the cause, to amend his pleadings so as to obviate the objection that his suit was not brought on the right side of the court. The cause shall proceed and be determined upon such amended pleadings. All testimony taken before such amendment, if preserved, shall stand as testimony in the cause with like effect as if the pleadings had been originally in the amended form.'\n\n To be sure, these sections do not create one form of civil action as do the Codes of Procedure in the states, but they \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 244]\n\u00a0\n manifest a purpose on the part of Congress to change from a suit at law to one in equity and the reverse with as little delay and as little insistence on form as possible, and are long steps toward Code practice.\n Coming now to apply those two sections thus construed to the case before us, we find that by defendant's answer and the court's order it became a bill of interpleader in equity. Thereafter the proceedings should have been so treated, both in the trial and appellate courts. The chancellor having sustained a bill of interpleader, disposed of the controversy between the claimants by directing any method of trial which would best and expeditiously accomplish justice in the particular case. State Insurance Co. v. Gennett, 2 Tenn. Ch. 100, 101; Rowe v. Hoagland's Adm'rs, 7 N. J. Eq. 131; Condict's Ex'rs v. King, 13 N. J. Eq. 375, 383; City Bank v. Bangs, 2 Paige, Ch. (N. Y.) 570, 573; Gibson v. Goldthwaite, 7 Ala. 281, 290, 42 Am. Dec. 592; Angell v. Hadden, 16 Vesey, 202; Kirtland v. Moore, 40 N. J. Eq. 106, 108, 2 Atl. 269; 2 Daniell's Ch. Practice (6th Am. Ed.) 1568, 1569. This well-established rule takes the issue here to be tried out of that class of issues in which there must have been a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. Where it was one which the chancellor could readily dispose of in one proceeding, it was in the interest of economy of expedition, and of justice that he should do so. This is in accord with the general rule in equity embodied in equity rule 23 (33 Sup. Ct. xxiv) that jurisdiction once assumed should be maintained to end the litigation. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 520\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 296\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 543; Camp v. Boyd, \n229 \nU.S. 530, 551\n, 552 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 785\n\n\n It was therefore error by the Circuit Court of Appeals to proceed as if it were reviewing a judgment in a suit at law upon a bill of exceptions. It is true that the record contained a bill of exceptions, but there was also a transcript of the same evidence certified as required \n\n[260 U.S. 235, 245]\n\u00a0\n in appeals in equity. The plaintiff below was evidently not certain of the proper practice and prepared for either writ of error or appeal. Under section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1246), appellate courts are enjoined to give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to techical errors, defects or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties; and under section 274b, whether the review is sought by writ of error or appeal, the appellate court is given full power to render such judgment upon the record as law and justice shall require. It follows that the court should have considered the issue of law and fact upon which the decree of the District Court depended; that is, whether there was a good and marketable title.\n On this review by certiorari, we could consider and decide the issue which the Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously refused to consider. On such an issue alone, however, we would not have granted the writ, because, except for the important question of practice, the case was not of sufficient public interest to justify it. We think it better, therefore, to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and to remand the case to that court for consideration and decision of the issues of fact and law in this case as on an appeal in equity. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIPKE v. LEDERER(1922)\nNo. 596\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Lincoln L. Eyre, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mrs. Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, for appellee. \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 558]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Relying upon Ketterer v. Lederer (D. C.) 269 Fed. 153, the court below dismissed the bill, upon motion, for want of equity (274 Fed. 493), and the cause is here by direct appeal.\n The bill alleges:\n That complainant, Lipke, paid all internal revenue taxes required by the laws of the United States for the year ending June 30, 1920, and he holds a retail liquor license issued by the court of quarter sessions, county of Philadelphia, for the year ending May 31, 1921. On December 29, 1920, he was arrested for selling liquor contrary to the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305), and gave bail to appear and answer in the United States District Court. This prosecution is still pending.\n That on March 18, 1921, complainant received a written communication from the defendant which stated:\n'Notice is hereby given that there has been assessed against you the amount of tax stated on this notice. Demand is hereby made for the immediate payment of said tax. If payment is not made within 10 days after date of this notice, a penalty of 5 per cent. of the amount of tax due will be added, plus interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per month until paid.'\n\n The total assessment amounted to $557.29, made up of three items indicated thus:\n'R. L. D. Sec. 35 D. T. 45.83; 11 Mos. 21 3244 P. 11.46; S. F. P. A. 1-26-21 S. P. 500.00.'\n\n That on March 31st he received a second written demand for $557.29, which penalty of 5 per cent. for failure to pay within prescribed time. And he was advised:\n'If payment of tax and penalty is not received within 10 days, collection of the same, with any accrued interests thereon and costs, shall be made by seizure and sale of property.'\n\n That:\n'In addition to the notice printed on said so-called tax bills, that the property of your orator will be \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 559]\n\u00a0\n seized and sold for nonpayment, your orator has been informed by officials of the defendant department that, after the expiration of 10 days from the rendition of said second notices, his property will be seized and sold by warrant of distress. ... He is now subject, at any moment, to have the defendant, as collector of internal revenue, seize his property, real or personal, for the nonpayment of said fines and penalties and that he is wholly without adequate remedy at law to prevent such seizure of his property.'\n\n That section 3244, U. S. Revised Statutes1 has no application; section 35 of the Prohibition Act confers no such power as the collector seeks to exercise; and he is undertaking to punish complainant by fine and penalty for an alleged criminal offense without hearing, information, indictment, or trial by jury, contrary to the federal Constitution. If the latter section has the meaning ascribed to it by defendant, it is unconstitutional.\n The prayer is for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding to collect the sum demanded by warrant of seizure, distress, or sale, or otherwise, and requiring a cancellation of the so-called 'tax bills.'\n Appellant maintains that the demand upon him was not for taxes, but for a penalty for an alleged criminal act; that the method adopted for enforcing his penalty is contrary to the federal Constitution; and that, if construed as appellee insists it should be, section 35 is unconstitutional.\n Appellee maintains that the cause involves only questions of construction, and therefore the appeal should be \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 560]\n\u00a0\n dismissed; that section 3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5947),2 prohibits the relief prayed; that the bill states no ground for equitable relief; and that full, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.\n The cause is properly here by direct appeal from the District Court. Appellant claimed that, as construed and sought to be enforced by the collector, section 35 of the Prohibition Act conflicts with the federal Constitution. The point is substantial, and sufficient to support our jurisdiction. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 U.S. 282\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 106 (December 12, 1921); South Covington, etc., Ry. Co. v. Newport, \n259 U.S. 97\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 418, 66 L. Ed. -- (May 15, 1922).\n The National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305, c. 85) is entitled:\n'An act to prohibit intoxicating beverages, and to regulate the manufacture, production, use, and sale of high proof spirits for other than beverage purposes, and to insure an ample supply of alcohol and promote its use in scientific research and in the development of fuel, dye, and other lawful industries.'\n\n'It is a comprehensive statute intended to prevent the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.' United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 U.S. 450\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 551 ( June 1, 1921).\n\n'Title II-Prohibition of Intoxicating Beverages,' contains 39 sections:\n\n'Sec. 3. No person shall on or after the date when the Dighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States goes into effect, manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this act, and all the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.\n\n ... \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 561]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 29. Any person who manufactures or sells liquor in violation of this title shall for a first offense be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not exceeding six months, and for a second or subsequent offense shall be fined not less than $ 200 nor more than $2,000 and be imprisoned not less than one month nor more than five years.\n ...\n'Sec. 35. All provisions of law that are inconsistent with this act are repealed only to the extent of such inconsistency and the regulations herein provided for the manufacture or traffic in intoxicating liquor shall be construed as in addition to existing laws. This act shall not relieve anyone from paying any taxes or other charges imposed upon the manufacture or traffic in such liquor. No liquor revenue stamps or tax receipts for any illegal manufacture or sale shall be issued in advance, but upon evidence of such illegal manufacture or sale a tax shall be assessed against, and collected from, the person responsible for such illegal manufacture or sale in double the amount now provided by law, with an additional penalty of $ 500 on retail dealers and $1,000 on manufacturers. The payment of such tax or penalty shall give no right to engage in the manufacture or sale of such liquor, or relieve anyone from criminal liability, nor shall this act relieve any person from any liability, civil or criminal, heretofore or hereafter incurred under existing laws.\n\n'The Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may compromise any civil cause arising under this title before bringing action in court; and with the approval of the Attorney General he may compromise any such cause after action thereon has been commenced.'\n\n The mere use of the word 'tax' in an act primarily designed to define and suppress crime is not enough to show that within the true intendment of the term a tax was laid. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n259 U.S. 20\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 449, 66 L. Ed. -- (May 15, 1922). When by its \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 562]\n\u00a0\n very nature the imposition is a penalty, it must be so regarded. Helwig v. United States, \n188 \nU.S. 605, 613\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 427. Evidence of crime (section 29) is essential to assessment under section 35. It lacks all the ordinary characteristics of a tax, whose primary function 'is to provide for the support of the government' and clearly involves the idea of punishment for infraction of the law-the definite function of a penalty. O'Sullivan v. Felix, \n233 \nU.S. 318, 324\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 596.\n The collector demanded payment of a penalty, and section 3224, which prohibits suits to restrain assessment or collection of any tax, is without application. And the same is true as to statutes granting the right to sue for taxes paid under protest. A revenue officer without notice has undertaken to assess a penalty for an alleged criminal act and threatens to enforce payment by seizure and sale of property without opportunity for a hearing of any kind.\n Section 35 prescribes no definite mode for enforcing the imposition which it directs, and, if it be interpreted as above stated, we do not understand counsel for the United States claim that relief should be denied to the appellant. Before collection of taxes levied by statutes enacted in plain pursuance of the taxing power can be enforced, the taxpayer must be given fair opportunity for hearing; this is essential to due process of law. Central of Ga. Ry. v. Wright, \n207 \nU.S. 127, 136\n, 138 S., 142, 28 Sup. Ct. 47, 12 Ann. Cas. 463. And certainly we cannot conclude, in the absence of language admitting of no other construction, that Congress intended that penalties for crime should be enforced through the secret findings and summary action of executive officers. The guaranties of due process of law and trial by jury are not be forgotten or disregarded. See Fontenot v. Accardo (C. C. A.) 278 Fed. 871. A preliminary injunction should have been granted.\n The decree of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 563]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs.\n The suit is in equity. So far as appears, the plaintiff had a full, adequate, and complete remedy at law; and there was no danger of irreparable injury. The relief should therefore be denied, whatever the construction of section 35, tit. 2, of the Volstead Act, and even if it be deemed unconstitutional. Compare Bailey v. George, \n259 U.S. 16\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 419, 66 L. Ed. --, decided May 15, 1922\n\n\n Plaintiff describes himself as a retail liquor dealer in Philadelphia, who had paid the federal special tax for the year ending June 30, 1920, and held a license under the Brooks Law which did not expire until May 31, 1921. On December 29, 1920, he was arrested, under section 2, tit. 2, of the Volstead Act, for illegally selling liquor, and the prosecution is still pending. On March 18, 1921, he received from the collector of internal revenue a 'Notice and Demand for Tax,' and on March 31, 1921, a second notice. By the latter he was informed that, if he did not pay the alleged tax within 10 days, collection would be made by seizure and sale of his property. The amount demanded is $557.29, made up of three items- one for $45.83 for double tax under said section 35; another of $11.46, called penalty, under section 3244 of the Revised Statutes; and a further amount of $500, 'special penalty,' under said section 35. This suit against the collector was commenced May 25, 1921. The plaintiff says that there is in law no authority to levy this alleged tax and the penalties; that the claim is in fact not for a tax, but for fines; that the so-called 'Notice and Demand for Tax' is in fact an attempt to inflict punishment without a hearing and without judicial trial; 'and that he is wholly without adequate remedy at law to prevent such seizure of his property.'\n The claim is for a small sum. For aught that appears, plaintiff might readily pay it under protest and bring an \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 564]\n\u00a0\n action against the collector to recover the amount paid. If he does not wish to pay, he can let the distraint be made, and then sue for the trespass incident to wrongful distraint; and, if personal property should be seized, he may replevy it. There is in the bill no allegation that the plaintiff is unable to pay the small amount claimed by the government; nor of fraud or oppression or abuse of process on the part of the collector; nor that a cloud will be cast upon title to real estate; nor that the property subject to distraint is of such a character that if distrained it will be sacrificed; nor that a proceeding in equity is necessary to prevent multiplicity of suits.\n If the sum assessed against the plaintiff is a tax legally due, distraint by the collector is a permissible and long-sanctioned method of collection. Revised Statutes,  3187-3216 Comp. St.  5909-5940); Hartman v. Bean, \n99 U.S. 393\n, 397; Blacklock v. United States, \n208 U.S. 75\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 228. Compare Scottish Union & National Insurance Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 632\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 345. If it is in its nature a tax, but is claimed to be an unconstitutional one, still, particularly in view of Revised Statutes,  3224, suit will not lie to restrain its collection. Snyder v. Marks, \n109 U.S. 189\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 157; Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 U.S. 118\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 275. And if the contention is that the government's demand is not for a tax at all, but for a fine, and that, therefore, Congress lacks power to confer upon the collector authority to collect it by distraint, still equity should not grant relief, because the bill fails to allege any fact showing that the legal remedy would not be adequate or that there is danger of irreparable injury. \n3\n Whether the government's demand be deemed one for a fine or for a tax \n\n[259 U.S. 557, 565]\n\u00a0\n which is unconstitutional, legal remedies are available; and there is, therefore, lack of jurisdiction in equity. We have here, at the worst, the case of a threatened distraint, which it is contended will be wrongful, if made; a case not differing in substance from wrongful distraint by landlords, or other wrongful distraint by tax collectors, and not differing in substance from wrongful attachment. In all these cases, as has long been settled, the owner of the property of which seizure is threatened is not entitled to relief in equity, unless it appears that there is no plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law.\n Whether the action of the government is lawful depends upon the construction of a statute, and on this question the lower courts have differed. As was said by this court in Arkansas Building & Loan Association v. Madden, \n175 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 119, 121 (44 L. Ed. 159):\n'It is quite possible that in cases of this sort the validity of a law may be more conveniently tested, by the party denying it, by a bill in equity than by an action at law; but considerations of that character, while they may explain, do not justify, resort to that mode of proceeding.'\n\n If the government is proceeding without warrant in law, the plaintiff should, of course, have redress. An early determination of the constitutional question presented would be desirable. But, in my opinion, we cannot properly decide it in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 3244.

U S(1922)\nNo. 147\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General James M. Beck and Mr. Wm. C. Herron, both of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[258 U.S. 374, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Most of the congressional land grant acts provide that railroads so aided shall be 'free from toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States.' Two of the lines of railroad forming part of the Louisville & Nashville system were built with the aid of such grants. For all transportation to which that provision applies, the rates payable by the government are now fixed at 50 per cent. of those charged private persons. See United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n249 U.S. 354\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 294. The company brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the balance of the full rate, alleging that the auditors and the Comptroller of the Treasury had erred in applying the land grant rates to transportation of certain officers and men who were not 'troops' of the United States, although in its service. That court dismissed the petition (55 Ct. Cl. 45) and the case is here on appeal.\n The persons transported were of ten different classes. Whether nine of these classes fall within the designation of 'troops' we need not consider, as bills for their transportation had been rendered by the carrier and payment therefor had been accepted under conditions which, on the findings made by the lower court, preclude further claim. Oregon- Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. v. United States, \n255 U.S. 339\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 329; Western Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, \n255 U.S. 349\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 332. There remains for our consideration the item of $252.70 alleged to be due for transportation of coast guards.\n The Coast Guard was established by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 20, 38 Stat. 800 (Comp St.  8459 1\/2a [1-6]), in lieu of the then existing Revenue Cutter Service and Life-Saving Service, and was composed of those organizations. The Revenue Cutter Service had been considered a civil service. 15 Op. Attys. \n\n[258 U.S. 374, 376]\n\u00a0\n Gen. 396; 16 Op. Attys. Gen. 288; 8 Comp. Dec. 852; 15 Comp. Dec. 807. But to its primary function of an armed police force some characteristics of a military force had always been attached; and from time to time Congress had conferred upon it additional incidents of the military service. \n1\n See 28 Op. Attys. Gen. 543, 547; 30 Op. Attys. Gen. 75. When the Coast Guard was established it was constituted 'a part of the military forces of the United States'; and section 1 provides that--\n It 'shall operate under the Treasury Department in time of peace and operate as a part of the Navy, ... in time of war or when the President shall so direct. When subject to the Secretary of the Navy in time of war the expense of the Coast Guard shall be paid by the Navy Department.'\n Congress further manifested its intention to class the Coast Guard with the Army, Navy and Marine Corps by the provisions in the Acts of August 29, 1916, c. 417, 39 Stat. 556, 600, 601 (Comp. St.  8459 1\/2 a [7- 14]), and chapter 418,  1, 39 Stat. 619, 649.\n The military force of the United States is, and always has been, a unit, although divided for purposes of administration into several branches; and there is nothing in the land grant acts to indicate an intention on the part of Congress to differentiate between the several branches in respect to transportation charges. We are of opinion that the term 'troops' is not confined to land forces, and that it includes men and officers in every branch. Since those in the Navy and Marine Corps are to be deemed troops within the meaning of those acts, members of the Coast Guard should also be deemed such when serving as part of the Navy. But at other times members of the Coast Guard are not troops; for then it operates under, and at the expense of, the Treasury Department. \n\n[258 U.S. 374, 377]\n\u00a0\n The original petition was filed June 1, 1916, but an amended and supplemental petition was filed on February 12, 1919. The findings of fact indicate that the items proved may include some transportation furnished as late as December 31, 1917. They do not disclose whether the transportation of coast guards was furnished before or after the declaration of war on April 6, 1917. Appellant has moved that the case be remanded to the Court of Claims, with directions, among other things, to find the facts in this respect. For that purpose and to that extent the motion to remand is granted, with direction to enter judgment for appellant for such part of the item of $252.70, if any, as represents transportation of coast guards furnished before the declaration of war. Except as it may be so modified, the decision of the Court of Claims is correct.\n Motion to remand granted, with directions to make a new finding of fact and modify the judgment, if need be, to accord with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts of March 2, 1799, c. 22,  98, 1 Stat. 627, 699; April 12, 1902, c. 501,  4, 32 Stat. 100; May 26, 1906, c. 2556, 34 Stat. 200; April 16, 1908, c. 145, 35 Stat. 61; March 4, 1911, c. 285,  1, 36 Stat. 1363, 1389.

B. King, George A. King, William E. Harvey, and George R. Shieds, all of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. W. D. Riter, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 7]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover damages for a breach of contract growing out of an alleged misrepresentation.\n The appellant essayed recovery upon a petition to which a demurrer was sustained; it then filed an amended petition which was subjected to a like disposition and then a second amended petition. Demurrer by the government being sustained to that, appellant declined to amend again, and judgment was entered dismissing the petition. From the ruling this appeal is prosecuted.\n The last petition is, as the others were, a very voluminous paper. It is enough to say that it sets forth a cause of action based upon a contract entered into by appellant with the United States September 23, 1910, for the construction of the west end of the new canal at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., which was authorized by the River and Harbor Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2509, 34 Stat. 1073, 1098. The petition details the specifications, but the misrepresentation is alleged to be that they and the contract represented that a portion of the work would be done in the 'dry' and a portion in the 'wet,' whereas it was impossible to do any of the work in the 'dry,' and it was all done in the 'wet,' at a cost greatly exceeding what it would have been had it been done the other way.\n For the purposes of permitting the work to be done in the dry, it was necessary to construct certain cofferdams, and this was especially provided for by the specifications. One of the cofferdams was known as the West Cofferdam, and was to be built as a contract item, and connected the rock spoil bank (extending along the north side of the work) with the old Northwest Pier. The latter pier was constructed by another contractor partly before and partly after the date the company entered into its contract with the United States. The company was a bider \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 8]\n\u00a0\n for the work the specifications of which were published and accessible. When the contract in suit was entered into, that prior contract was in progress, but not completed, and was not completed until after the company had begun work on its contract.\n The company, it alleges, made all reasonable inquiries and investigations upon the site of the contract between the date of advertisement and the date of submitting its bid, and by its president and chief engineer inspected the conditions. The work under the previous contract of March 23, 1908, was then in progress.\n The company estimated and believed, as it had a right to do, is its allegation, that the specifications of that contract had been and were being duly and properly performed. If they had been so performed, is the further allegation, the company would have been able to perform, under its own contract, in the dry such portions of the work as were required by the contract to be done in the dry.\n It was only during the progress of the work that the company discovered that the previous contract and not been carried out, and that the work was defective. In consequence, extraordinary and expensive means had to be resorted to for a continuance of the work, and the work was greatly delayed beyond the time that the company would have had to take if the conditions had been as shown by the specifications of the previous contract, and had the work been performed by the previous contractor according to the specifications.\n This expense continued until July 3, 1913, and the description as dry work in the specifications was, by reason of the conditions existing at the site of the work, a misrepresentation of the character of the work to be done, and induced on the part of the company a lower bid than would have been made if the conditions had been properly described. \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 9]\n\u00a0\n Owing to the leakage coming through the old Northwest Pier, it was not practicable for excavation to be made in the dry. Notwithstanding, the engineer in charge compelled the work to be done as contracted for, and the company sustained damages in the sum of $366,052.67, for which it prayed judgment.\n It is contended that the circumstances detailed amount to a representation by the United States that the work could be done in the dry, but that it was impossible to so perform it, and that therefore, the resulting expense should be discharged by the government, and that the Court of Claims erred in dismissing the petition.\n To these assertions the government opposes denials: (1) There was no misrepresentation. (2) If there were it is not available to the company, since it had investigated conditions before entering into the contract. (3) There was no misrepresentation as to the method by which the excavating could be done.\n In considering the opposing contentions there must be taken into account certain provisions of the contract. It is therein provided that--\n'It is understood and agreed that the quantities given in these specifications are approximately only, and that no claim shall be made against the United States on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative in the same. No allowance will be made for the failure of a bidder or of the contractor to estimate correctly the difficulties attending the execution of the work.\n\n'It is expected that each bidder will, prior to submitting his bid, visit the site of the work, examine the local conditions, inform himself as to the accessibility of the work, ascertain the character of the material to be excavated, consult the plats on file in the United States engineer's office at Sault Sainte Marie, Mich., and obtain such available information as will assist him to make an intelligent bid, and the failure of a bidder to make such examination \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 10]\n\u00a0\n may be held to be sufficient reason for rejecting his bid.\n\n'The contractor must construct and maintain all the necessary cofferdams, furnish suitable pumping plant, and do all the pumping required to unwater all areas where work is to be done in the dry, and no special payment will be made therefor, the above work and expense being considered as incident to the general work covered by the contract prices of other items. ...\n\n'The United States assumes no responsibility whatsoever for loss of life, property or contractors' time due to the failure of any part of the cofferdams, dikes or pumping plant.\n\n In supplement of these provisions of the contract, the following provisions of the company's proposal upon which the contract was awarded is pertinent:\n'We make this proposal with a full knowledge of the kind, quantity, and quality of the plant, work and materials required. ...'\n\n The repellent effect of those provisions, and the contentions of the company, would seem to need no comment, and the effect is reinforced by other considerations. The contract of the company was made September 23, 1910, and at that time, according to the averments of the petition, work on the prior contract was in progress, and had been in progress two years. And it is averred that the company--\n'made all reasonable inquiries and investigations upon the site of the contract between the date of advertisement, July 30, 1910, and the date of submitting its bid, August 29, 1910, by the president and chief engineer of the company personally inspecting the conditions. The work under the previous contract of March 23, 1908, was then in progress and uncompleted.'\n\n The company was undoubtedly impelled to this investigation by the requirement of its contract to inform itself of the conditions, and that no allowance would \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 11]\n\u00a0\n be made for the failure to estimate correctly the difficulties attending the execution of the work. Its investigation may or may not have been adequate. It, however, took its chances on that. But, in reality, there was no representation by the government, nor is it alleged that the government had knowledge of the conditions or means of knowledge superior to the knowledge of the company. The latter acquired knowledge only by the aid of divers as its work progressed. Such being the situation, does not the case present one of misfortune rather than misrepresentation? It is true that the government's proposal was for a certain part of the work to be done in the dry, but it made no representation of the conditions that existed enabling it to be so done or precluding it from being so done. The company had no relation with the government through the other contract. The company assumed that it had been properly performed, but the government did nothing to create or direct the assumption or induced confidence in it.\n Such being the situation, the company insists, nevertheless, that the government is liable, and cites, among other cases, Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 553; Christie v. United States, \n237 U.S. 234\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 565; United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 U.S. 1\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 423; United States v. Smith, \n256 U.S. 11\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 413, and insists that, though the asserted representations of fact in the present case differ somewhat from those made in the cited cases, they are the same in principle, and that the provisions in paragraph 23 that 'the work required to be done to complete this portion [the protion of the proposed canal lying between certain cross sections] of the canal should be performed in the dry' was not only a mandate, but was necessarily a representation that conditions would be encountered which would enable the work to be done in the dry.\n A systematic explanation of the cases would extend this opinion to too great a length. They all declare the principle \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 12]\n\u00a0\n that the government will be liable in the same circumstances that private individuals would be liable, but, necessarily, neither is liable if neither makes representations.\n In Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 553, 555 (58 L. Ed. 898), the government was held liable because 'the specifications spoke with certainty as to a part of the conditions to be encountered by the claimants,' and of those, it was said, 'the government might be presumed to speak with knowledge and authority.'\n In Christie v. United States, \n237 U.S. 234\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 565, 'there was [we quote from the opinion] a deceptive representation of the material, and it misled.' The claimants in the case, it was said, were forced to rely upon the information furnished them by specifications which were untrue and known to the officers of the United States to be untrue. To the extent that they were untrue claimants recovered. As to other conditions which might or might not have been foreseen it was to be supposed, it was said, 'that contemplation and judgment were exercised not only of certainties but of contingencies, and allowance made for both at the time of the bid, with provision in the bid.'\n In United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 U.S. 1\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 423, the representations made by the government were deceptive, in that the test borings gave information to the government not imparted to bidders, of materials more difficult to excavate than those shown by the maps and specifications. The case is instructive, as it considers other cases and the grounds of their decisions.\n The elements which existed in each of the cited cases are absent from the case at bar. In the case at bar the government undertook a project and advertised for bids for its performance. There was indication of the manner of performance but there was no knowledge of impediments to performance, no misrepresentations of the conditions, exaggeration of them, nor concealment of them, \n\n[258 U.S. 6, 13]\n\u00a0\n nor, indeed, knowledge of them. To hold the government liable under such circumstances would make it insurer of the uniformity of all work, and cast upon it responsibility for all of the conditions which a contractor might encounter, and make the cost of its projects always an unknown quantity. It is hardly necessary to say that the cost of a project often defermines for or against its undertaking.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCKEE v.

Mayner Wallace, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the respondent, who is also a cross petitioner, to recover the value of mussel shells removed from the lands of the respondent's assignor and manufactured by the petitioners into buttons. It was brought in a Court of the State of Missouri, but was removed to the District Court of the United States. There were two counts; one simply for the conversion of the shells and a second alleging that the shells were part of the realty and that the plaintiff was entitled to treble damages under R. S. Mo. 1909,  5448 (R. S. Mo. 1919,  4242). At the trial the District Court directed a verdict for the defendants and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Gratz v. McKee, 258 Fed. 335, 169 C. C. A. 351. The main question was disposed of on the ground that by the Statutes of Missouri, R. S. 1909,  6508, 6551, the title to the mussels was in the State. \n\n[260 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n As to the second count it was held that the mussels were not part of the realty. Later, a rehearing was granted, and while the Court adhered to its former opinion on the second count, it rightly, as we think, held that the statutes declaring the title to game and fish to be in the State spoke only in aid of the State's power of regulation and left the plaintiff's interest what it was before. See Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 434\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984. It assumed that the defendants were trespassers and sent the case back for a new trial on that footing, the damages to be confined to the value of the shells at the date of conversion and not to include that subsequently added by manufacturing them into buttons. Gratz v. McKee (C. C. A.) 270 Fed. 713.\n The mussels were taken alive from the bottom of what seems to have been at times a flowing stream, at times a succession of pools, were boiled on the banks and the shells subsequently removed. As to the plaintiff's title, it is not necessary to say that the mussels were part of the realty within the meaning of the Missouri Statutes or in such sense as to make the plaintiff an absolute owner. It is enough that there is a plain distinction between such creatures and game birds or freely moving fish, that may shift to another jurisdiction without regard to the will of land owner or State. Such birds and fishes are not even in the possession of man. \n252 U.S. 434\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984; 2 Kent, Comm. 349; Young v. Hichens, 6 Q. B. 606. On the other hand it seems not unreasonable to say that mussels having a practically fixed habitat and little ability to move are as truly in the possession of the owner of the land in which they are sunk as would be a prehistoric boat discovered under ground or unknown property at the bottom of a canal. Elwes v. Brigg Gas Co., 33 Ch. D. 562; Reg. v. Rowe, Bell, C. C. 93; Barker v. Bates, 13 Pick. (Mass.) 255, 23 Am. Dec. 678. This is even more obvious as to the shells, when left piled upon the bank, as they were, to \n\n[260 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n await transportation. Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Lewis, \n162 \nU.S. 366, 378\n, 382 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 831. Possession is enough to warrant recovery of substantial damages for conversion by a trespasser. We say nothing about the character of the stream as to navigability. The jury at least might find that there was nothing in that to prevent the application of what we have said. We are slow to believe that there were public rights extending to the removal of mussels against the land owner's will.\n But it cannot be said as matter of law that those who took the mussels were trespassers; or even wrongdoers in appropriating the shells. The strict rule of the English common law as to entry upon a close must be taken to be mitigated by common understanding with regard to the large expanses of unenclosed and uncultivated land in many parts at least of this country. Over these it is customary to wander, shoot and fish at will until the owner sees fit to prohibit it. A license may be implied from the habits of the country. Marsh v. Colby, 39 Mich. 626, 33 Am. Rep. 439. In Missouri the implication is fortified by the limit of statutory prohibitions to enclosed and cultivated land and private ponds. R. S. 1919 ,  5662, 3654. There was evidence that the practice had prevailed in this region. Whether those who took these mussels were entitled to rely upon it, and whether, if entitled to rely upon it for occasional uses, they could do so to the extent of the considerable and systematic work that was done were questions for the jury. They could not be disposed of by the Court. The implication of a license of the kind that we have mentioned from general understanding and practice does not encounter the difficulties that have been suggested in implying a license from conduct alone in cases where the same conduct after twenty years might generate an easement, it being a plain contradiction to imply ad interim a license which would prevent the acquisition of a prescriptive \n\n[260 U.S. 127, 137]\n\u00a0\n right. Chenery v. Fitchburg R. Co., 160 Mass. 211, 212, 35 N. E. 554, 22 L. R. A. 575.\n As to the rule of damages in case the plaintiff recovers, in the absence of a decision by the Supreme Court of the State we should not regard the mussels as part of the realty within the meaning of the statute relied upon in the second count, and so far as appears at present we see no reason for charging the defendants, if at all, with more than the value of the mussels at the time of conversion as ruled below. Wetherbee v. Green, 22 Mich. 311, 7 Am. Rep. 653; Wooden-Ware Co. v. United States, \n106 U.S. 432\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 398; Union Naval Stores Co. v. United States, \n240 U.S. 284\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 308. The result is that this judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed, but not all the principles laid down by it, and that the case will stand for trial by jury in the District Court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCKELVEY v.

The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 273 Fed. 410. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n The record purports to contain the substance of the evidence in chief presented by the United States, but not the evidence produced by the defendants, nor that of the United States in rebuttal. That which it does contain tends strongly to establish the following case:\n In August, 1919, the owners of a band of sheep then about 30 miles northwest of Mackay, Idaho, committed to three employes the task of driving the sheep to a range on the other side of Mackay. A part of the route lay over unoccupied public lands of the United States in relative proximity to a stream, called Lost river. In that vicinity there were two well-known trails. One, recently established,1 passed on the east side of the river, and the other, theretofore used by the owners of the sheep, passed on the west side. The employes took the latter trail, and, while following it in the usual way of driving sheep, were met by some of the defendants, who insisted that the lands thereabouts were used as a cattle range and demanded that the sheep be not driven along that trail, but taken to the trail on the other side of the river, 4 or 5 miles away. This occurred about 11 o'clock in the forenoon of August 25th, when it was very warm. One of the employes answered that the sheep should be permitted to rest until it became cooler, and that they could not be taken across the river without an order from one of the owners. Such of the defendants as were present then pointed out a place where the sheep could be held \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 355]\n\u00a0\n in the shade and went away. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon some of the defendants returned and demanded that the sheep be moved to the other side of the river right away. To this the answer was made that instructions had been received, presumably by telephone, from one of the owners to await his coming, which would be later in the day. One of the defendants then requested his comrades to line up with their rifles, which they did, whereupon he proceeded to make a hostile demonstration against one of the employes and to chase him about, obviously as a matter of intimidation. These defendants then went away. That evening one of the owners arrived and directed that the driving be continued along the trail on which the employes were proceeding; it being 'the trail we always used' and 'about 3 miles wide.' Early the next morning, before the employes started the sheep again, one of the defendants returned and inquired what was going to be done, and, on learning what the owner had directed, said: 'You can't go through there.' 'Something will happen to you this morning.' 'Are you willing to take the consequences?' This defendant then rode away, and a little later others of them rode up on a gallop, ordered the employes to put up their hands, which was done, and then began shooting. They shot and seriously injured one of the employes, threatened to finish him, and did other things calculated to put all three in terror. The defendants then moved two of the employes and the sheep to the other side of the river and took the wounded employe to a hospital. While some of the defendants were present at one time, and some at another, the circumstances were such that what was done was the act of all. The lands through which this trail extended and over which the employes intended to drive the sheep were unoccupied public lands of the United States. The purpose of the defendants in all that they \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 356]\n\u00a0\n did was to prevent the employes from proceeding with the sheep over those lands. The lands were comprised in two townships, each 6 miles square, and within these townships were several small tracts-a minor part of the whole- which were claimed and held by individuals under the public land laws; but the trail did not pass over these small tracts, nor were the employes driving or intending to drive the sheep over them.\n The indictment was founded on sections 3 and 4 of the Act of February 25, 1885, c. 149, 23 Stat. 321 (Comp. St.  4999, 5000) which read as follows:\n'Sec. 3. That no person, by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing, or any other unlawful means, shall prevent or obstruct, or shall combine and confederate with others to prevent or obstruct, any person from peaceably entering upon or establishing a settlement or residence on any tract of public land subject to settlement or entry under the public land laws of the United States, or shall prevent or obstruct free passage or transit over or through the public lands: Provided, this section shall not be held to affect the right or title of persons, who have gone upon, improved or occupied said lands under the land laws of the United States, claiming title thereto, in good faith.\n\n'See. 4. That any person violating any of the provisions hereof, whether as owner, part owner, or agent, or who shall aid, abet, counsel, advise, or assist in any violation hereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars or be imprisoned not exceeding one year, or both, for each offense.'\n\n The indictment was challenged on several grounds by a demurrer and a motion in arrest of judgment, both of which were overruled; and error is assigned on these rulings.\n One ground of objection is that the indictment contains no showing that the accused were not within the exception \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n made in the proviso to section 3. This is not a valid ground. By repeated decisions it has come to be a settled rule in this jurisdiction that an indictment or other pleading founded on a general provision defining the elements of an offense, or of a right conferred, need not negative the matter of an exception made by a proviso or other distinct clause, whether in the same section or elsewhere, and that it is incumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it. Schlemmer v. Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburg Ry. Co., \n205 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 407; Javierre v. Central Altagracia, \n217 \nU.S. 502, 508\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 598, and cases cited.\n Another ground is that the words of section 3, 'or shall prevent or obstruct free passage or transit over or through the public lands,' refer to a continuing obstacle to passage or transit in general, such as a fence or the maintenance of an armed patrol, and not to a transient obstacle to passage or transit by particular persons on a particular occasion, such as is charged here. We think this ground is not tenable. The words 'by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing, or any other unlawful means' are as comprehensive of transient means of obstruction as of continuing or relatively permanent means. Besides, it is 'free' passage or transit that is to be unobstructed. Passage or transit is free in the sense intended when it is open to all. When some withhold it from others, whether permanently or temporarily, it is not free.\n A third ground is that under section 4 the only punishable offenses are those wherein the offender acts as owner, part owner or agent, and that this indictment does not show that any of the defendants were so acting. This ground is without merit. While section 4 is not happily worded, there is no difficulty in getting at its meaning. It is the penal section and broadly fixes the punishment for the several acts made unlawful by the other sections. \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 358]\n\u00a0\n Some of the proscribed acts involve an assertion of a groundless right to the exclusive use and occupancy of public lands, a right which the offender might be asserting in his own behalf, or in behalf of himself and another, or in behalf of others whom he serves as agent. But in several of the proscribed acts there is no such element. The offense charged here is of the latter class. With this understanding of the acts made unlawful by the other sections, it is apparent that the words 'whether as owner, part owner, agent' in section 4 are intended merely to make sure that offenders acting as owners, part owners or agents are brought within the penal provision, and not to exclude other offenders therefrom or to absolve them from punishment.\n It also is contended that section 3, when construed as we construe it, transcends the power of Congress and encroaches on the police power of the states. This contention proceeds on the assumption that the section, so construed, deals with acts of personal violence which do not affect the public lands or the rights of the United States in them. But this is a mistaken assumption. The section in terms, and as we construe it, deals with the obstruction by unlawful means of free passage over the public lands. It makes no attempt at dealing with acts of personal violence as such. Only when and as they are made the means-resorted to for the purpose- of effecting the prohibited obstruction does it take any account of them. The power of the state to deal with and punish them is not affected. Such acts may be an ingredient of an offense against the United States and also in themselves as an offense against the state. The following excerpt from Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 20 (14 L. Ed. 306) is pertinent:\n'The same act may be an offense or transgression of the laws of both. Thus, an assault upon the marshal of the United States, and hindering him in the execution of legal process, is a high offense against the United States, \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 359]\n\u00a0\n for which the perpetrator is liable to punishment; and the same act may be also a gross breach of the peace of the state, a riot, assault, or a murder, and subject the same person to a punishment, under the state laws, for a misdemeanor or felony. That either or both may (if they see fit) punish such an offender, cannot be doubted. Yet it cannot be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offense; but only that by one act he has committed two offenses, for each of which he is justly punishable.'\n\n It is firmly settled that Congress may prescribe rules respecting the use of the public lands. It may sanction some uses and prohibit others, and may forbid interference with such as are sanctioned. Camfield v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 518, 525\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 864; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 521\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 480; Light v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 523, 536\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 485; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 404\n, 405 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 387. The provision now before us is but an exertion of that power. It does no more than to sanction free passage over the public lands and to make the obstruction thereof by unlawful means a punishable offense.\n It also is settled that the states may prescribe police regulations applicable to public land areas, so long as the regulations are not arbitrary or inconsistent with applicable congressional enactments. Among the regulations to which the state power extends are quarantine rules and measures to prevent breaches of the peace and unseemly clashes between persons privileged to go upon or use such areas.\n Two regulations of the latter type by the state of Idaho have been sustained by this court-one making it unlawful to herd sheep or permit them to graze within two miles of the dwelling house of another having a possessory claim to the land whereon the house stands (Bacon v. Walker, \n204 U.S. 311\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 289), and the other making it unlawful to herd sheep or permit them to graze on a range which \n\n[260 U.S. 353, 360]\n\u00a0\n by prior usage has come to be a cattle range (Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 U.S. 343\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 323). As construed by the Supreme Court of the state, these regulations are not intended to cover the driving of sheep from one range to another, nor such occasional grazing as is done by the sheep while being driven or during temporary stops for needed rest or similar purposes. In view of the instructions to the jury in this case the verdict must be taken as finding that there was no herding or grazing here which was forbidden by these regulations.\n Complaint is made of several rulings on the trial, but we think all were right. As to some the complaint is disposed of by what has been said, and as to the others it is so wanting in substance that it does not call for special notice.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Presumably under section 10 of the Act of December 29, 1916, c. 9. 39 Stat. 862 (Comp.

OF BALTIMORE(1922)\nNo. 416\nArgued: December 16, 1921Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Arthur W. Machen, Jr., of Baltimore, Md., for defendant in error. \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error, a corporation organized under the laws of Maryland and authorized to act as guardian, was on January 30, 1919, appointed by the orphans' court guardian of Frank R. Brown, an infant whose father had died intestate about a year before. The son as next of kin became entitled to 35 shares of the stock of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, and they were transferred to defendant in error as such guardian, and still are held by it in that capacity. At that time the capital stock of the insurance company issued and outstanding consisted of 20,000 shares of the par value of $100 each. Later in the year that company, under statutory authority, increased its capital stock to 40,000 shares of the same par value. The resolution of the stockholders sanctioning the increase provided that the right to subscribe to the new issue should be offered to the stockholders at the price of $150 per share, in the proportion of one share of new stock to each share of stock held by them; subscriptions to be payable in installments and the directors to have power to dispose of shares not so subscribed and paid for in such manner as they might determine to be for the best interests of the company. In July, 1919, defendant in error, pursuant to an order of the orphans' court, sold the subscription right to 35 shares owned by its ward for $12, 546.80, equivalent to $358.48 per share. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, holding that this entire amount was income for the year, under the provisions of the act approved February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6371 1\/4 a et seq.), assessed and plaintiff in error collected a tax amounting to $1,130.77 by reason of it. Defendant in error, having paid this under protest and unavailingly appealed to the Commissioner, claiming that none of the amount so received \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n was income within the meaning either of the act or of the Sixteenth Amendment, brought this action against the collector to recover the entire amount of tax so assessed and paid. The case was tried before the District Court without a jury on stipulated facts and evidence. Plaintiff's extreme contention that the subscription right to new stock and also the proceeds of the sale of the right were wholly capital and not in any part subject to be taxed as income, was overruled upon the authority of Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 U.S. 509\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305, then recently decided. The trial court, in the second place, held that, of the proceeds of the sale of the subscription rights, so much only as represented a realized profit over and above the cost to plaintiff of what was sold was taxable as income. In order to compute the amount of the profit, the court commenced with the value of the old shares prior to authorization of the stock increase, which upon the basis of evidence contained in the stipulation was taken to be what they were assessed at by the United States for purpose of the estate tax at the death of the ward's father, viz., $710 per share, and added the $150 necessary to be paid by a stockholder or his assignee in order to obtain a share of the new stock, making the cost of two shares (one old and 1 new) $ 860, and half of this the cost of one share.\n The sale of the subscription rights at $358.48, the purchaser to pay the issuing company $150 per share, was treated as equivalent to a sale of the fully-paid shares at $508.48 each, or $78.48 in excess of the $430 which represented their cost to plaintiff; and this difference multiplied by 35, the number of shares or rights sold, yielded $2,746.80 as the gain realized out of the entire transaction. Upon this the court held plaintiff to have been properly taxable, and upon nothing more; no income tax being assessable with respect to the 35 shares still retained, because, although they were considered worth more, ex \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n rights, than the $430 per share found to be their cost, the difference could not be regarded as a taxable profit unless or until realized by actual sale. 273 Fed. 822. To review the final judgment entered pursuant to the findings and opinion, which sustained only in part plaintiff's demand for a refund of the tax paid, the collector of internal revenue prosecuted a direct writ of error from this court under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), because of the constitutional questions involved.\n There is but one assignment of error, based upon a single exception, which denied that plaintiff was entitled to recover anything whatever; hence the correctness of the particular recovery awarded is not in form raised; but the trial judge, having the complete facts before him, almost of necessity passed upon them in their entirety in order to determine, according to truth and substance, how much of what plaintiff received was, and how much was not, income in the proper sense, as is proper in a case involving the application of the Sixteenth Amendment (Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570; United States v. Phellis [November 21, 1921] \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63), and in order to review the judgment, it will be proper for us to analyze the reasoning upon which it was based.\n It is not in dispute that the Hartford Fire Insurance Company is a corporation of the state of Connecticut and that the stock increase in question was made under authority of certain acts of the Legislature and certain resolutions of the stockholders, by which the right to subscribe to the new issue was offered to existing stockholders upon the terms mentioned. It is evident, we think, that such a distribution in and of itself constituted no division of any part of the accumulated profits or surplus of the company, or even of its capital; it was in effect an opportunity given to stockholders to share in contributing additional capital, not to participate in distribution. It was a recognition \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n by the company that the condition of its affairs warranted an increase of its capital stock to double the par value of that already outstanding, and that the new stock would have a value to the recipients in excess of $150 per share; a determination that it should be issued pro rata to the existing stockholders, or so many of them as would pay that price. This privilege of itself was not a fruit of stock ownership in the nature of a profit; nor was it a division of any part of the assets of the company.\n The right to subscribe to the new stock was but a right to participate, in preference to strangers and on equal terms with other existing stockholders, in the privilege of contributing new capital called for by the corporation-an equity that inheres in stock ownership under such circumstances as a quality inseparable from the capital interest represented by the old stock, recognized so universally as to have become axiomatic in American corporation law. Gray v. Portland Bank, 3 Mass. 364, 3 Am. Dec. 156; Atkins v. Albree, 12 Allen (Mass.) 359, 361; Jones v. Morrison, 31 Minn. 140, 152-153, 16 N. W. 854; Eidman v. Bowman, 58 Ill. 441, 447, 11 Am. Rep. 90; Humboldt Driving Park Ass'n v. Stevens, 34 Neb. 528, 534, 52 N. W. 568, 33 Am. St. Rep. 654; Electric Co. v. Electric Co., 200 Pa. 516, 520-523, 526, 50 Atl. 164; Wall v. Utah Copper Co., 70 N. J. Eq. 17, 28 et seq., 62 Atl. 533; Stokes v. Continental Trust Co., 186 N. Y. 285, 78 N. E. 1090, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 969, 9 Ann. Cas. 938. Evidently this inherent equity was recognized in the statute and the resolution under which the new stock here in question was offered and issued.\n The stockholder's right to take his part of the new shares therefore- assuming their intrinsic value to have exceeded the issuing price-was essentially analogous to a stock dividend. So far as the issuing price was concerned, payment of this was a condition precedent to participation, coupled with an opportunity to increase his capital investment. In either aspect, or both, the subscription right of itself constituted no gain, profit or income taxable without apportionment under the Sixteenth Amendment. \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, is conclusive to this effect.\n But in that case it was recognized (\n252 U.S. 212\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570) that a gain through sale of dividend stock at a profit was taxable as income, the same as a gain derived through sale of some of the original shares would be. In that as in other recent cases this court has interpreted 'income' as including gains and profits derived through sale or conversion of capital assets, whether done by a dealer or trader, or casually by a non-trader, as by a trustee in the course of changing investments. Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 U.S. 509\n, 517-520, 41 Sup. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305\n\n\n Hence the District Court rightly held defendant in error liable to income tax as to so much of the proceeds of sale of the subscription rights as represented a realized profit over and above the cost to it of what was sold. How the gain should be computed is a matter of some contention by the government in this court; but it admits of little doubt. To treat the stockholder's right to the new shares as something new and independent of the old, and as if it actually cost nothing, leaving the entire proceeds of sale as gain, would ignore the essence of the matter, and the suggestion cannot be accepted. The district court proceeded correctly in treating the subscription rights as an increase inseparable from the old shares, not in the way of income but as capital; in treating the new shares if and when issued as indistinguishable legally and in the market sense from the old; and in regarding the sale of the rights as a sale of a portion of a capital interest that included the old shares. What would have happened had defendant in error decided to accept the new shares and pay the issuing price instead of selling the rights is of no consequence; in that event there would have been no realized profit, hence no taxable income. What resulted or might have resulted to defendant in error's retained interest in the company, depending upon whether the purchaser exercised his right \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n to subscribe or allowed it to lapse, or whether in the latter event the stock was sold by the directors, is of speculative interest only. Defendant in error resorted to the market for the sale of a part of its capital interest, concededly sold at an advance over cost, and what the profit actually was is the sole concern here; not whether it might have been more or less, nor whether the purchaser disposed of the stock to advantage.\n That a comparison of the cost at acquisition and the selling price is proper under section 202(a) of the act (40 Stat. 1060 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 bb]), where, as here, the property was acquired and sold within the same taxing year, we understand to be conceded. Under the stipulation, the court below was warranted in finding $710 per share to have been the fair market value of the old stock when turned over to the guardian, and treating this as its cost to the trust. It was proper to add to this the $150 required to be paid to the company and treat the total as the cost to plaintiff of each two shares one of which was to pass to the purchaser. This in essence is the method adopted by the Treasury Department in the case of a sale of dividend stock, in Regulations 45 ( 1920 Ed.) art. 1547, which reads:\n'Art. 1547. Sale of Stock Received as Dividend.-Stock in a corporation received as a dividend does not constitute taxable income to a stockholder in such corporation, but any profit derived by the stockholder from the sale of such stock is taxable income to him. [ Following Eisner v. Macomber, supra.] For the purpose of ascertaining the gain or loss derived from the sale of such stock, or from the sale of the stock with respect to which it is issued, the cost (used to include also, where required, the fair market value as of March 1, 1913), of both the old and new shares is to be determined in accordance with the following rules:\n\n'(1) Where the stock issued as a dividend is all of substantially the same character or preference as the stock upon which the stock dividend is paid, the cost of each \n\n[259 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n share of both the old and new stock will be the quotient of the cost, or fair market value as of March 1, 1913, if acquired prior to that date, of the old shares of stock divided by the total number of the old and new shares. ...'\n\n That the averaging of cost might present more administrative difficulty in a case more complicated than the present, as where the old shares were acquired at different times, is not a sufficient ground for denying the soundness of the method itself.\n Various suggestions, more or less ingenious, as to how the profit ought to be computed, made by counsel for defendant in error and by an amicus curiae, have been examined and found faulty for reasons unnecessary to be mentioned. Upon the whole, we are satisfied that the method adopted by the District Court led to a correct result.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNESOTA v.

An accurate copy of the official coordinates of these later triangulation points was also secured by Commissioner Gannett, and a true copy of same is hereto attached and marked table No. 2.\n\n'With these co-ordinates it is possible to accurately relocate the original Meade triangulation points, or to show the new ones on the Meade map in their true positions, and the last-mentioned points are thus shown on Exhibit No. 1, being marked by triangles in black ink.\n\n'Having the existing, or new, triangulation points platted in their true positions on the Meade map, it is possible to 'tie in' by scale any points or lines on said map to these triangulation points, and to transfer said points \n\n[258 U.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n or lines to the ground by similar measurements from said triangulation points.\n\n'Office Procedure.\n\n'With this information at hand, the commission laid down on the tracing of the original Meade map, Exhibit No. 1, the boundary line between the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, in accordance with the decree of the court, namely: 'From a point midway between Rice's Point and Connor's Point, through the middle of Lower St. Louis Bay, to and with the deep channel leading to Upper St. Louis Bay, and to a point therein immediately south of the southern extremity of Grassy Point; thence westward along the most direct course, through water not less than eight feet deep eastward of Fisherman's Island, as indicated by the red trace A, B, C on Minnesota's Exhibit No. 1, approximately one mile to the deep channel and immediately west of the bar therein, thence with such channel north and west of Big Island upstream to the 'Falls.\"\n\n'The center of the pivot pier of the Interstate Bridge was found to be the point midway between Rice's Point and Connor's Point, and was designated by the commission as station No. O. From this point, as a beginning, a series of straight lines was laid out to conform with the decree of the court, special care being taken to have the lines over water not less than eight feet deep as shown by the Meade map, and the angle points between said lines numbered consecutively.\n\n'From such of these angle points as were convenient 'ties' were scaled to the best situated triangulation points on the map, and by means of rectangular co-ordinates from each angle point on the lines between the 'ties,' to triangulation points, the lengths and angles of deviation of the several lines were calculated, and closed polygons formed. These polygons were then checked as \n\n[258 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n to closure by the method of latitudes and departures, and any errors found were balanced so as to secure closure. By this means your commissioners were enabled, with a close approach to accuracy, to determine the lengths and angles of deviation of the several lines composing the projected boundary line.\n\n'The lengths and angles thus determined and the 'ties' to the several triangulation points were used as preliminary field notes by the surveying party employed to 'run out the boundary line and to locate same by proper monuments, courses and distances.'\n\n'Boundary Line Above Fond du Lac.\n\n'For that portion of the St. Louis river beyond Fond du Lac, and extending to the 'Falls,' and which is not shown on the Meade chart or map, the commission established the center line of the river, as a medial line between the shore lines, as surveyed by the commission, and designated said medial line as the boundary line.\n\n'The Survey.\n\n'As the boundary line, except in a few instances, runs over water from 8 feet to over 20 feet in depth, the most convenient time for surveying it was after ice had formed to a safe thickness. The winter proved to be mild and the ice conditions unfavorable, adding greatly to the danger and difficulty of the work, and increasing the time necessary to finish it.\n\n'The surveying party was organized early in January, 1921, and the necessary equipment was rented or purchased. Starting at station O, heretofore described, the approximate position of the boundary line was laid out on the ice, in the bay and river, from the preliminary field notes, and the 'ties' to the triangulation points, measured. Such discrepancies, due to the curvature of the earth, or to errors in scaling from the map, as were \n\n[258 U.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n shown by measuring the 'ties,' were allowed for and distributed in the angles and distances of all the lines back to the preceding 'tie.' If any important discrepancy was discovered, the lines involved were re-run before any adjustments were made, From the final field notes of the adjusted survey, a description of the boundary line by courses and distances was obtained, and is incorporated herein. This work was completed March 19, 1921.\n\n'Detailed Description of Boundary Line.\n\n'[Here follow lengthy and detailed descriptions of the boundary line, as determined, the monuments, and of triangulation and reference points, with geographic positions, which are omitted by the reporter as not being of general interest. Persons interested in these may consult the original decree in the clerk's office, obtain certified copies, or consult the copies forwarded to the Governors of the two states.]\n\n'Map of Boundary Line.\n\n'The commission has prepared, and transmits herewith as Exhibit No. 2, a map of St. Louis Bays and river on the scale of 1:24000, showing their present conditions, improvements along the harbor front, the United States government harbor lines and channels, and the relative position of the boundary line.

CLARENDON BOAT OAR CO(1922)\nNo. 102\nArgued: January 20, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Allan Sholars and Henry Bernstein, both of Monroe, La., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. C. Theus, of Monroe, La., for defendant in error. \n\n[257 U.S. 533, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the judgment of the highest court of the state of Louisiana to which the case could be taken. The plaintiff, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, a Missouri corporation, sued the defendant company, the Clarendon Boat Oar Company, a New York company, for damages in the district court of Richland parish, for the breach of an affreightment contract entered into in the state of Arkansas and to be performed in that state. The defendant appeared solely to except to the jurisdiction. The district court sustained the exception, and, on appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Second Circuit, this ruling was affirmed and the cause dismissed. The Supreme Court of the state refused to entertain an appeal.\n Act 243 of 1912, p. 543, and Act 267 of 1914, p. 532, of the Annual Laws of Louisiana, provide that service on foreign corporations may be made on any agent which the corporation has designated, and require that every foreign corporation doing business in the state shall file a written declaration with the Secretary of the State, showing its domicile and the place or places where it is to do business and designating its agent, resident in the parish where its business is to be done, and that service on said agent, whether personal or domiciliary, shall be a valid service on it. The Court of Appeal in this case held, following what it deemed to be the holding by the Louisiana Supreme Court in the case of Watkins v. North American Land & Timber Co., 106 La. 621, 31 South. 172, 87 Am. St. Rep. 309, that the Louisiana statute was not intended to give the state courts jurisdiction over foreign corporations by service on agents appointed thereunder, in transitory actions arising in another state. The action of the Supreme Court in refusing to entertain an appeal in this cause shows this to be the \n\n[257 U.S. 533, 535]\n\u00a0\n authoritative construction of the statute by the state courts.\n This writ of error is based on the theory that the statute of Louisiana, thus construed, denies the plaintiff in error due process of law and the equal protection of the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. In the Watkins Case, supra, the Supreme Court of the state held that the provisions of the foreign corporation law furnished equal opportunity to residents and nonresidents to sue foreign corporations. The contention comes down to this, therefore, that it is a lack of due process for a state statute of procedure to fail to furnish a person, within the limits of the state, power to sue a nonresident corporation and take judgment for a cause of action arising in another state. Under section 2 of article 4 of the federal Constitution, the citizens of each state are entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. This secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state; but where the citizens of the latter state are not given a process for reaching foreign corporations, it is not apparent how noncitizens can claim it. Provisions for making foreign corporations subject to service in the state is a matter of legislative discretion, and a failure to provide for such service is not a denial of due process. Still less is it incumbent upon a state in furnishing such process to make the jurisdiction over the foreign corporation wide enough to include the adjudication of transitory actions not arising in the state. Indeed, so clear is this that in dealing with statutes providing for service upon foreign corporations doing business in the state upon agents whose designation as such is especially required, this court has indicated a leaning toward a construction, where possible, that would exclude from their operation causes of action not arising in the business done by them in the state. Robert Mitchell Furniture \n\n[257 U.S. 533, 536]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Selden Breck Construction Co. (opinion handed down December 5, 1921) \n257 U.S. 213\n, 42 Sup.

The latter case was a Louisiana case under this same law. In these circumstances and this state of the authorities in this court, it is frivolous to claim that a statute of procedure by its failure to give jurisdiction over foreign corporations, in transitory actions arising in another state, constitutes a lack of due process of which plaintiff in error can complain.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the appellant's petition upon demurrer. The petition alleges that the claimant had outstanding contracts calling for more than the actual production of its mines for the months of June and following through November, 1918, at a price of $4.50 per gross ton; that the Fuel Administration appointed by the President during the war 'requisitioned and compelled petitioner to divert 12,823.29 tons of coal' during the period mentioned; that the price received for this coal was $3.304 per gross ton, and that the claimant thereby suffered a loss of $15,337.37, for which loss it asks judgment against the United States.\n The petition does not allege or mean that the United States took the coal to its own use. The meaning attributed to it by the claimant is merely that the Fuel Administration fixed the price on coal of this quality at $3.304 per gross ton and issued orders from time to time directing coal to such employments as best would promote the prosecution of the war. The Fuel Administration acted under a delegation from the President of the power conferred upon him by the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53,  25, 40 Stat. 276, 284 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 q), to fix the price of coal and to regulate distribution \n\n[259 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n of it among dealers and consumers; the price so fixed not to invalidate contracts previously made in good faith in which prices are fixed. 40 Stat. 286. The claimant does not argue that this section provides compensation for obedience to orders made in pursuance of the same; it agrees, and rightly, that its remedy, if any, is under section 145 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1136), giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction of claims upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government. It contends that upon the facts stated a contract on the part of the Government must be implied, both from the statute and by virtue of the Fifth Amendment on the ground that its property was taken for public use.\n We see no ground for the claim. The claimant in consequence of the regulation mentioned sold some of its coal to other parties at a less price than what otherwise it would have got. That is all. It now seeks to hold the Government answerable for making a rule that it saw fit to obey. Whether the rule was valid or void no such consequence follows. Making the rule was not a taking and no lawmaking power promises by implication to make good losses that may be incurred by obedience to its commands. If the law requires a party to give up property to a third person without adequate compensation the remedy is, if necessary, to refuse to obey it, not to sue the lawmaker. The statute provides remedies against the Government in other cases, but the claimant argues that this case does not fall within them, and it did not follow the steps prescribed for them. The petition does not even allege that the price the claimant got was not a fair one but only that if the Government had not issued the regulation it would have got more under its contract. Considerably more than that is needed before a promise of indemnity from the Government can be implied. See American Smelting & Refining Co. v. United States, \n259 U.S. 75\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 420, 66 L.

O'Donohoe, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover upon a policy insuring the life of one Blees, issued to him and subsequently assigned by him to his wife, now Mrs. Liebing, the plaintiff (defendant in error). The contract was made on September 29, 1901, by the defendant (the plaintiff in error), in Missouri, by a delivery of the policy to Blees in Macon, Missouri, where he lived. Three annual premiums were paid. After the fourth was due, within the time allowed, Blees and his wife signed an application for a loan of $9,550 and sent it with the policy to the defendant's agency at St. Louis, by which it was forwarded to New York. The application followed the terms of the policy, which agreed that after it had been in force three years the company would lend amounts within the cash surrender value, upon certain conditions, the policy being assigned as security. Following these terms the application deducted from the cash to be received the fourth annual premium and an adjustment of interest, leaving the balance to be paid $4, 790.50. The loan was to be for one year and the application authorized the company upon default to cancel the policy and apply the customary cash surrender consideration to the payment of the loan. The application was approved in New York and a check for $4,790.50 to the order of Mr. and Mrs. Blees, with a receipt for the fourth premium, was \n\n[259 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n sent from New York to the company's manager in St. Louis and by him forwarded to a local agent who delivered the documents to Blees. The check was endorsed and paid. A year later when repayment was due it was not made. Thereupon on December 4, 1905, the company cancelled the policy and applied the surrender value to the loan, which was of equal amount, leaving a deficit of $74.57 interest. Blees died on September 8, 1906, and upon inquiry from Mrs. Blees the company notified her of what had been done. Its action had been in accordance with the terms of its contract and the law of New York. But some years later, Mrs. Blees, now Mrs. Liebing, brought the present action relying upon the Revised Statutes of Missouri 1899,  7897, set forth and considered in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge, \n246 U.S. 357\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 593, and after a previous decision the other way, she recovered by the final judgment of the Supreme Court of the State. 226 S. W. 897.\n The Missouri statute provided that such policies as the present, after three annual payments, should not become void for non payment of premiums, but that three-fourths of the net value of the policy after deducting certain liabilities should be taken as a premium for temporary insurance for the full amount written in the policy. It is not disputed that if this statute governs the case, the plaintiff stood as having a policy for the original amount at the death of Mr. Blees. In New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge, \n246 U.S. 357\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 593, it was held that when the later transaction was consummated in New York, Missouri could not prohibit a citizen within her borders from executing it. But if the later contract was made in Missouri, then by the present and earlier decisions notwithstanding any contrary agreement the statute does govern the case. See \n246 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 593.\n The policy now sued upon contained a positive promise to make the loan if asked, whereas in the one last mentioned \n\n[259 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n it might be held that some discretion was reserved to the company. For here the language is 'the company will ... loan amounts within the limits of the cash surrender value,' etc., whereas there it was 'cash loans can be obtained.' On this distinction the Missouri court seems to have held that as soon as the application was delivered to a representative of the company in Missouri the offer in the policy was accepted and the new contract complete, and therefore subject to Missouri law. If, however, the application should be regarded as only an offer the effective acceptance of it did not take place until the check was delivered to Blees, which again was in Missouri where he lived. In whichever way regarded the facts lead to the same conclusion, and although the circumstances may present some temptation to seek a different one by ingenuity, the Constitution and the first principles of legal thinking allow the law of the place where a contract is made to determine the validity and the consequences of the act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL UNION FIRE INS.

D., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. B. Overson and Wm. G. Owens, both of Williston, N. D., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of North Dakota, brought to reverse its judgment affirming one of the district court of Williams county of that state for $1,254.25, with interest and costs, upon a contract of hail insurance against the National Union Fire Insurance Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania. The judgment rests for its validity on section 4902 of the Compiled Laws of North Dakota of 1913, as follows:\n'Every insurance company engaged in the business of insuring against loss by hail in this state, shall be bound, and the insurance shall take effect from and after twenty-four hours from the day and the hour the application for such insurance has been taken by the authorized local agent of said company, and if the company shall decline to write the insurance upon receipt of the application, it shall forthwith notify the applicant and agent who took the application, by telegram, and in that event, the insurance shall not become effective: Provided, that nothing in this article shall prevent the company from issuing a policy on such application and putting the insurance in force prior to the expiration of said twenty- four hours.'\n\n The facts as stipulated were:\n At 10 o'clock in the forenoon of July 12, 1917, Wanberg, on his farm at Tioga, in North Dakota, signed and delivered to Everson, the agent of the defendant company, an application on the blank furnished by the company for insurance on his crops in the sum of $1,400 against loss or damage by hail or any other cause, except \n\n[260 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n fire, floods, winterkill, or failure of insured to use good husbandry. He also paid to Everson the premium of $140. Everson had authority as agent only to solicit and receive such applications and the premium therefor and to transmit them to the company's Western office at Waseca, Minn., where applications were acted upon and policies issued. The company was duly licensed under the laws of North Dakota to transact its business in the state. On the afternoon of July 13, 1917, Everson mailed the application with the premium, less commission, to the office at Waseca, where it arrived on Sunday, July 15th, and was delivered on Monday the 16th. In the meantime, at 6 o'clock in the evening of July 14th, a hail storm injured Wanberg's growing crops to the extent of the amount of the judgment. On Tuesday, July 17th, and without knowledge of the loss, the Waseca agency returned the application and premium to Everson, saying that at that late date it would not be accepted. The application contained a provision that it should take effect from the day it was received and accepted, as evidence by the issuance of a policy thereon at the Waseca, Minn., agency for the company.\n The only error we can consider which was duly reserved is that section 4902 as applied to this case violates the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it operates to deprive the company of liberty of contract, and therefore of its property without due process of law, and of the equal protection of the laws.\n The decision of this court in German Alliance v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, settled the right of a state Legislature to regulate the conduct by corporations, domestic and foreign, of insurance as a business affected with a public interest. This includes provision for 'unearned premium fund or reserve, the limitation of dividends, the publishing of accounts, valued policies, standards of policies, prescribing investment, requiring \n\n[260 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n deposits in money or bonds, confining the business to corporations, limitation of risks, and other regulations equally restrictive.' \n233 U.S. 412\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 619, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189. It includes moreover the restrictions of defense to recovery on policies and the forbidding of stipulations to evade such restrictions. Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 281; Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., \n205 U.S. 489\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 578. But it is said the line of possible and valid regulation has here been passed by affirmatively imposing a contract on an insurance company before it has had a chance to consider the circumstances and decide that it wishes to make it; indeed, that it declares that to be an agreement with heavy obligation which is in fact no agreement at all. Thus it is argued that by this statute mandatory obligation is substituted for freedom of contract which is just that against which the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to secure persons. We agree that this legislation approaches closely the limit of legislative power, but not that it transcends it. The statute treats the business of hail insurance as affected with a public interest. In that country, where a farmer's whole crop, the work and product of a year, may be wiped out in a few minutes and where the recurrence of such manifestations of nature is not infrequent, and no care can provide against their destructive character, it is of much public moment that agencies like insurance companies to distribute the loss over the entire community should be regulated so as to be effective for the purpose. The danger and loss to be mitigated are possible for a short period. The storms are usually fitful, and may cover a comparatively small territory at a time, so that of two neighbors, one may have a total loss, and the other may escape altogether. The risk justifies a high rate of insurance. It differs so much in these and other respects from other insurance that it may properly call for special legislative treatment. The statute applies to all companies engaged \n\n[260 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n in such insurance. There is no discrimination, and no denial of the equal protection of the laws. The fact that the time requirements of the statute may bear more heavily on foreign companies whose principal offices may be far removed than upon those whose headquarters are within the state is a circumstance necessarily incident to their conduct of business in another state of which they cannot complain. They cannot expect the laws of the state to be bent to accommodate them as a matter of strict legal right, however wise it may be for a Legislature to give weight to such a consideration in securing the use of foreign capital for its people. Moreover, as the business of such insurance companies is purely intrastate ( New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 U.S. 495\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 167), the state has power to require them to accept conditions different from those imposed on domestic corporations (Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 207, and cases cited), though this is not, of course, unlimited (Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529, 532\n, 533 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 188).\n The Legislature was evidently convinced that it would help the public interest if farmers could be induced generally to take out hail insurance and 'temper the wind' so injurious to the agriculture of the state, and that they would be more likely to avail themselves of this protection if they could effect the insurance promptly and on the eve of the danger. The Legislature said, therefore, to companies intending to engage in hail insurance:\n'To accomplish our purpose we forbid you to engage in this kind of business unless you agree to close your contracts within 24 hours after application is made. You must so extend the scope of the authority of your local agents, or must so speed communication between them and your representatives who have authority, as to enable an applicant to know within the limits of a day whether he is protected, so that, if not, he may at once go to \n\n[260 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n another company to secure what he seeks. If, therefore, you engage in this exigent business, and allow an application to pend more than 24 hours, you will be held to have made the contract of insurance for which the farmer has applied.'\n\n This does not force a contract on the company. It need not accept an application at all, or it can make its arrangements to reject one within 24 hours. It is urged that no company, to be safe and to make the business reasonably profitable, can afford to place more than a certain number of risks within a particular section or township, and that what is called 'mapping' must be done to prevent too many risks in one locality, and to distribute them so that the company may not suffer too heavily from the same storm. Applications are often received by agents in different towns for the crops in the same section or township, so that, if local agents were given authority finally to accept applications, this 'mapping,' essential to the security at all, would be impossible. It seems to us of the company in doing the business that this is a difficulty easily overcome by appointing agents with larger territorial authority and subagents near them, or by the greater use of the telegraph or telephone in consulting the home office of more trusted local agencies. While the time allowed is short, we cannot say that it is unreasonable in view of the legitimate purpose of the legislation and the possibilities of modern business methods.\n There is nothing in the statute under discussion which requires a company to receive applications or prevents it from insisting on the payment of a premium in advance before receiving them, or from reserving the usual right on the part of the insurer at any time to cancel the contract of insurance on service of due notice with a return of a proper proportion of the premium. Not infrequently companies in their own interest in some kinds of insurance intrust to local insurance agents authority to bind \n\n[260 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n their principals temporarily until the application can be examined and approved by the head office. The statute here in question has been in force since 1913, and it does not seem to have driven companies out of the hail insurance business, an indication that they are able profitably and safely to adjust themselves and their methods to its requirements. Whether it is wise legislation is not for us to consider. All we have to decide and that we do decide is that it is not so arbitrary or unreasonable as to deprive those whom it affects of their property or liberty without due process of law.\n It is pointed out on behalf of the company that the very application which the defendant in error signed contained an express consent that the policy should not take effect until the company's agency at Waseca, Minn., should have an opportunity to examine it and should accept it. It is clear that, if the statute is valid, such a consent is void, because it defeats the very object of the statute. This is settled by Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., \n205 U.S. 489\n, 27 Sup.Ct. 578, and Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 19 Sup.

Y., for respondent.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 340, 344]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for personal injuries to the plaintiff, the respondent in this Court, caused by the collision of a train upon which he was employed by the defendant, the petitioner, as an engineer, with a train of the Michigan Central Railroad Company. After several trials and about seven years and a half after the suit was begun the plaintiff was allowed to amend his complaint by alleging that at the time of the collision the plaintiff and defendant were engaged in interstate commerce. He got the present judgment under the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), the jury having found that the parties were so engaged. The defendant contended that the amendment introduced a new cause of action and under  6 of the Act could not be allowed after the two years' limitation had run. See also Act of April 5, 1910, \n\n[260 U.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n c. 143, 36 Stat. 291. A writ of certiorari was granted to dispose of this doubt.\n The original complaint set forth facts that would have given a cause of action at common law, under the statutes of New York or the Act of Congress, as one or another law might govern. It alleged a notice, required by the New York statute and to that extent pointed to that. The amended complaint, against the petitioner alone, while it introduced the allegations objected to, retained the allegation as to notice, and was treated by the trial Court, seemingly with the approval of the higher Courts of the State, as warranting a recovery under either law as the jury should find. There is nothing in the statutes of the United States to prevent this form of pleading, as is indicated incidentally in the case that we are about to cite upon the main point.\n In Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 U.S. 570\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134, the declaration was by the mother as sole heir and next of kin of an employee of the plaintiff in error, in terms referring to a statute of Kansas giving her right of action for injuries resulting in death. An amendment was allowed, more than two years after the injury, in which the plaintiff declared both as sole beneficiary and next of kin and as administratrix and relied both on the Kansas law and on the Act of Congress. The plaintiff got a judgment under the Act of Congress which was sustained by this Court although the original declaration by the plaintiff could not be attributed to the Employers' Liability Act, because the plaintiff sued only in her personal capacity and relied for that, as she had to, upon the Kansas law. \n226 U.S. 576\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134. It is true that the fact of the injury arising in interstate commerce was pleaded by the defendant. But it was pleaded as a bar to the action as it then stood and only makes more marked the changes that the amendment introduced. We do not perceive that the effect of the amendment in that case distinguishes it from \n\n[260 U.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n this. It really is a stronger case, because, as we have said, here the declaration was consistent with a wrong under the law of the State or of the United States as the facts might turn out. The amendment 'merely expanded or amplified what was alleged in support of the cause of action already asserted ... and was not affected by the intervening lapse of time.' Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Renn, \n241 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 567, 568 (60 L. Ed. 1006). 'The facts constituting the tort were the same, whichever law gave them that effect.' Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Koennecke, \n239 \nU.S. 352, 354\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 126. See also St. Louis, San Francisco & Texas Ry. Co. v. Smith, \n243 U.S. 630\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 477. Of course an argument can be made on the other side, but when a defendant has had notice from the beginning that the plaintiff sets up and is trying to enforce a chaim against it because of specified conduct, the reasons for the statute of limitations do not exist, and we are of opinion that a liberal rule should be applied.\n We shall not discuss at length other points that technically are open but that did not induce the granting of the writ, such as the sufficiency of the evidence that the parties were engaged in interstate commerce, the instruction as to assumption of risk, etc. We see no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment and it must stand.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK, N H & H R. CO. v. FRUCHTER(1922)\nNo. 35\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. James W. Carpenter, of New Haven, Conn., for petitioner. \n\n[260 U.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harold R. Medina and Leon Sanders, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Since 1908, 149th street, New York City, has been carried over and across the tracks of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad by a public municipal steel truss bridge of standard construction. The bridge is 54 feet wide, 270 feet long and is formed of posts, beams, girders, etc ., connected and strengthened by trellis or lattice work. The top girders, or beams, are 23 feet above the street. The local law imposes upon the railroad the duty of maintaining the framework; the municipality is required to keep the roadway in repair.\n Fastened to the top girder at the end of the bridge are two upright steel lattice towers, posts, or struts. Cross-arms, attached to these 6 feet above their bases, support bare wires carrying electric current used for operating trains. The nearest wire is 19 inches from the strut. \n\n[260 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n With considerable difficulty and some danger active boys can climb to the highest parts of the bridge. They did often climb upon it; some reached the struts. They were frequently chased away by a policeman and the railroad guard, and seem generally to have understood that to play there was forbidden; when a officer came in sight, they kept off. At each corner of the bridge there was a notice board displaying the words: 'Live Wires. Danger. Keep Off.'\n In June, 1916, the plaintiff David Fruchter, 8 years old, by using the trellis work, climbed from the street to the top of the bridge in quest of a bird's nest. He then saw a bird on the wire above, and to catch it claimbed up the strut and reached out; the bird flew away; his hand touched the wire, and severe injuries resulted. He sued for damages, and the father also seeks to recover for loss of services and expenses incurred. The causes were tried together. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed judgments for the plaintiffs February, 1921. 271 Fed. 419.\n At the time of the accident the boy was attending school. Whether he could then read the warning words upon the notice boards is left in doubt; upon the witness stand he both affirmed and denied that he could. He further stated that before climbing upon the bridge he looked to see whether a policeman was present, and admitted that if one had been there he would not have gone up.\n The court below accepted the theory that the jury could have found the structure was well known to be both dangerous and attractive to children, and that failure to supply proper guards, human or mechanical, constituted negligence within the doctrine of Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657 and Union Pacific Railway Co. v. McDonald, \n152 U.S. 262\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 619.\n In United Zinc & Chemical Co. v. Britt, \n258 U.S. 268\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 299 (March 27, 1922), we pointed out the theory upon which liability may \n\n[260 U.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n exist for injuries suffered by an infant, although the circumstances would give no cause of action to an adult:\n'Infants have no greater right to go upon other people's land than adults, and the mere fact that they are infants imposes no duty upon landowners to expect them and to prepare for their safety. On the other hand, the duty of one who invites another upon his land not to lead him into a trap is well settled, and while it is very plain that temptation is not invitation, it may be held that knowingly to establish and expose, unfenced, to children of an age when they follow a bait as mechanically as a fish, something that is certain to attract them, has the legal effect of an invitation to them although not to an adult. ... There can be no general duty on the part of a landowner to keep his land safe for children, or even free from hidden dangers, if he has not directly or by implication invited or licensed them to come there.'\n\n Considering the peculiar circumstances of the present cause, it is clear that if the plaintiff had been an adult he could not recover; and we are unable to find any sufficient evidence from which the jury could have properly concluded that the railroad company either directly or by implication invited or licensed him to climb upon the strut to a point from which he could touch the bare wire 30 feet above the street. The motion for an instructed verdict should have been granted.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK, N H & H R.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., for the United States. \n\n[258 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim for $5,020.65 as the claimant's proportion of joint through express rates for carrying $5,000,000 in gold from Philadelphia to Boston, and the passenger fares for seven men who accompanied the gold as guards from New York to Springfield, Massachusetts, that being the distance that the claimant carried the gold, The Court of Claims ordered the petition to be dismissed.\n On October 23, 1914, the gold was delivered by the Treasury Department to the Post Office Department in one thousand sealed bags, each weighing 18 3\/4 pounds, which were placed in one hundred and sixty-seven locked mail pouches labelled 'Boston, Mass.' The Treasury prepaid the postage required for fourth class mail matter, at parcel post rates, amounting to $420. On reaching New York the gold was placed in a vault subject to the call of the chief clerk of Railway Mail Service. The next day the chief clerk and other railway officials took the pouches to the Grand Central Station where they were placed in a postal car attached to a regular passenger train of the claimant. The car with its contents was carried to Springfield and there delivered to the Boston & Albany road. It carried with the gold seven officials of the Railway Mail Service, all having the requisite travel commissions from the Postmaster General. No protest was made by any carrier and the claimant was paid and received without protest the amount fixed by readjustment orders for carrying the mail over its route.\n The claimant admitting that it could not demand additional pay for hauling the mails, New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, \n251 U.S. 123\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 67, argues that the transaction was not 'mail service' such as it had contracted to perform or within the classification of mail matter. It urges that in view of the weight limit, \n\n[258 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n eleven pounds, in force July 1, 1913, when its four-year term began; the weight of these bags, 18 3\/4 pounds; of the contents, gold; and of the fact that the bags were sealed and placed in locked pouches, the Postmaster General could not make the service mail service if he tried. We think it unnecessary to discuss the argument, if there is anything in it. The service here, rightly or wrongly, was demanded as mail service, was rendered as mail service and was paid for without protest as mail service. Whether the Treasury technically complied with all the requirements of the statute concerning postal service did not matter to the claimant. By giving its claim a different name from that passed upon in New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 40 S. Sup.

O'Brien, of New York City, for defendant Swann.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Consolidated Gas Company was organized in 1884 by consolidation of six corporations then manufacturing, distributing and selling gas in New York City and has continued to carry on the business making additions and extensions as required by the increasing demand. Chapter 125, Laws of New York 1906, required it to sell gas with illuminating power of 22 candles, at no more than 80 cents per 1,000 cubic feet. A suit brought soon after this act became effective to enjoin its enforcement, because confiscatory, was finally dismissed without prejudice (Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034), and for many years thereafter the company supplied gas at the prescribed rate. January 16, 1919, it instituted the present proceeding against the Attorney General and other public officers. The bill alleges that the statutory rate is confiscatory- prevents and will continue to prevent a fair return on the property used- and prays for an injunction.\n A master, appointed in May, 1919, heard testimony from day to day for eight months-about 20,000 printed pages-and presented this to the court with his report and opinion, May 5, 1920. Having considered the results of actual operations during all of 1918 and the first eight months of 1919, and wellknown subsequent conditions, he concluded:\n'On the basis of the prices, rates of pay, and costs prevailing during the eight months beginning January 1, 1919, the cost of making and distributing gas has been such as to allow a very small, if any return, on even the actual investment; and since September 1, 1919, the cost of making and distributing gas has been increased in a number of respects so that the fair inference is that the complainant company now finds itself without any return upon the investment. \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n The conditions found by me have existed for more than a year last past, and to a lesser degree for at least a year before that time, and will continue for at least a considerable period of time, the end of which cannot now be forecast. Upon such a situation and such a prospect. I think that the complainant company has shown itself, clearly and beyond all reasonable doubt, entitled to relief from the statutory limitation on its rates, but that its rate of return should be calculated, not upon the present high reproduction cost of its property, with or without the deduction of observed or actual depreciation, in whatever manner computed, but upon the actual, reasonable, investment in the property devoted to the service of the complainant's consumers.'\n\n In a carefully prepared opinion, while disagreeing with the master concerning some valuations and resolving all doubts against the company, the court held the prescribed rate had been confiscatory since January 1, 1918, and would continue so to be. 267 Fed. 231; 274 Fed. 986.\n An amended decree-entered August 11, 1920-enjoined enforcement of the act upon condition 'that until March 1, 1921, or until the earlier promulgation of a gas rate applicable to the plaintiff by some competent authority of the state of New York, the plaintiff shall neither charge nor collect for the sale of gas in the city of New York more than the sum of one dollar and twenty cents per thousand cubic feet,' and also upon the further condition that it should impound, or adequately secure, collections above 80 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, for ultimate distribution in accordance with any rate so established.\n A broad appeal was allowed in No. 257 September 9, 1920. In No. 258 an appeal allowed November 10, 1920, brings up those parts of the August decree which imposed conditions upon continuation of the injunction. \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n February 28, 1921, the trial court undertook to modify the August decree by directing that the excess derived from sales above 80 cents per 1,000 feet should be impounded until three months after determination of the appeal here, or until a rate should be fixed by competent state authority, and, further, that such sums should be subject to ultimate distribution 'as nearly as may equitably be done' in accordance with that rate and the approved principles and findings relative thereto. The appeal from this order is No. 288.\n Equity rules 75 and 76 (33 Sup. Ct. xl, xli)1 direct that records on appeal shall not set forth the evidence fully but in simple condensed form and require omission of nonessentials and mere formal parts of documents. Without apparent attempt to comply with these rules and with assent of appellee's counsel, appellants in No. 257 have filed a record \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n of 21 volumes-20,000 printed pages-made up largely of stenographic reports of proceedings before the master with hundreds of useless exhibits and many thousand pages of matter without present value. This is indefensible practice, which we shall hereafter feel at liberty to punish to the limit of our discretion-possibly by dismissal of the appeal. These rules were intended to protect the courts against useless, burdensome records and litigants from unnecessary costs and delay. Counsel ought to comply with them, and trial courts should enforce performance of this plain duty.\n The fundamental question presented for determination was whether the 80-cent rate had been confiscatory under conditions existing during 1918 and 1919 and probably would continue so to be. Considering the rulings here in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Company and other cases, the answer required little more than an appreciation of facts not very difficult to ascertain. The master's report and opinion disclose careful and intelligent consideration of the whole matter. 'Resolving all doubts against the plaintiff' and using valuations 'pared down unsparingly,' the trial court agreed with the master's ultimate findings and ruled that to enforce the statute would result in confiscation. Since March 30, 1921, the Public Service Commission has had power to prescribe rates for appellee unrestricted by the maximum specified in the act of 1906; but no such action has been taken. It did, however, authorize a rate of $1.40, instead of 80 cents, for another company operating in New York City, effective after August 1, 1920, and has thus indicated its informed judgment. See Morrell v. Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. (Appeal No. 1, July 14, 1921) 231 N. Y. 405, 132 N. E. 130. We are, of course, aware of the enormous increase in cost of labor and materials since this court declared that appellee might possibly earn 6 per centum under the 80-cent rate. In view of all these things, only very cogent reasons would \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n justify complete reversal of the challenged decree. The points relied upon by appellants in No. 257 and their supporting arguments have been considered, and we think no such reasons are shown. To discuss all of these would subserve no sufficient purpose-only a few present questions of general interest.\n Appellants earnestly insist that they were denied fair and impartial trial both by the master and the court. So far as it relates to the court, we dismiss the suggestion as frivolous. Undoubtedly during the many months devoted to hearings the master talked too much and often unwisely; but, manifestly, appellants' counsel made the situation unnecessarily difficult and failed to support the master's earnest efforts promptly to ascertain the essential facts. Looking at all the circumstances we are unable to conclude that any substantial right was denied. The size of the record, eight months of almost daily hearings and the master's reiterated offers to hear properly prepared and helpful evidence show that abundant opportunity was given for presentation of appellants' cause. The master wiseld sought to exclude ill-advised cross-examinations and other unimportant matter.\n Since 1907 the Gas Company has been subject to supervision by a commission empowered to prohibit unreasonable rates and the presumtion is that any profits from its business were lawfully acquired. Municipal Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 225 N. Y. 89, 99, 121 N. E. 772. Mere past success could not support a demand that it continue to operate indefinitely at a loss. The public has no such right in respect of private property although dedicated to public use. When it became clear that the prescribed rate had yielded no fair return for more than a year, and that this condition would almost certainly continue for many months, the company was clearly entitled to relief.\n The claim that appellee had failed to supply gas of the prescribed candle power, and therefore came into court \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 176]\n\u00a0\n with unclean hands and should not be heard, is without merit. The company was subject to official control; the facts as to candle power of the gas actually furnished are in dispute; the calorific quality had become more important to most consumers than the illuminating one; the master reached the conclusion that the statutory standard had been substantially complied with; it had earnestly tried under very diffcult circumstances to meet its customers' requirements. It sought relief from an unlawful burden-the fundamental wrong arose from the statute-and we find nothing which could justify refusal to consider its demand.\n Complaint is also made because the master admitted appellee's books in evidence. These books were kept in the ordinary course under general supervision of the commission, appeared free from suspicion of dishonesty, were submitted to appellants' experts, and were the only readily available sources of detailed information concerning the company's affairs. In the circumstances we think no harm resulted from admitting them as prima facie evidence. Rowland v. Boyle, \n244 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 577\n\n\n The general doctrine applicable when rates are alleged to be confiscatory has been so often stated that present discussion of it is unnecessary. Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 U.S. 1\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 148; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Des Moines Gas Co. v.

Lincoln, \n250 U.S. 256\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 454.\n In No. 258 the Gas Company complains of the limit of $1.20 per 1,000 cubic feet up to March 1, 1921, as a condition to continuation of the injunction, and also because sums above 80 cents per 1,000 were impounded for ultimate distribution in \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 177]\n\u00a0\n accordance with nay rate which might be fixed thereafter by competent state authority.\n It was within the court's discretion to grant the injunction upon terms and we cannot now say that the limitation upon charges amounted to abuse. But grave injustice may result from action of this kind and the power should be very cautiously exercised. See Morrell v. Brooklyn Borough Gas Company (Appeal No. 1, July 14, 1921) 231 N. Y. 405, 132 N. E. 130. It was error to direct ultimate distribution of the impounded funds in accordance with any subsequently approved rate. Rate making is no function of the courts and should not be attempted either directly or indirectly. After declaring the 80-cent rate confiscatory, the court should not have attempted, in effect, to subject the company for an indefinite period to some unknown rate to be proclaimed in the future upon consideration of conditions then prevailing.\n The amendatory decree of February was obtained long after appeals from the August decree had been granted and when the court had very limited power over the litigation. 'One general rule in all cases (subject, however, to some qualifications) is that an appeal suspends the power of the court below to proceed further in the cause.' Undoubtedly, after appeal the trial court may, if the purposes of Justice require, preserve the status quo until decision by the appellate court. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 157\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 136. But it may not finally adjudicate substantial rights directly involved in the appeal. Merrimack River Savings Bank v. Clay Center, \n219 \nU.S. 527, 534\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 295, 55 L Ed. 320, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 513. See First Nat. Band v. State Bank, 131 Fed. 430, 65 C. C. A. 414. The precise result of the February decree is somewhat doubtful, but we may treat it as an attempt to preserve the status quo in order that this court might finally and completely dispose of the whole matter. Thus interpreted the decree (No. 288) was within the court's \n\n[258 U.S. 165, 178]\n\u00a0\n discretion and as there was no abuse of this discretion it must be affirmed.\n All impounded funds should be promptly released to the Gas Company subject only to deductions for such costs as are clearly assessable to the prevailing party. Costs of appeal No. 257 will be taxed to appellants; in No. 258 to the appellees. Modified as here indicated, the decree below is affirmed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It seems proper to add that we do not intend by anything said herein to intimate what would have been a reasonable rate for the sale of gas under the circumstances disclosed. The 80-cent rate was confiscatory; the $ 1.20 maximum imposed by the court during a specified period as a condition to the injunction was a limitation in favor of the consumers. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equity Rule 75. ...

OF NEW YORK(1922)\nNo. 750\nArgued: April 28, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry Herzoff, of New York City, for appellants in Nos. 750 and 751.\n Mr. Wm.

Newton, Attorney General, v. Consolidated Gas Co., and Charles D. Newton, Attorney General, v. New \n\n[259 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n York & Queens Gas Co., were disposed of upon former appeals decided March 6, 1922. \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264, 66 L. Ed. --. By supplemental decrees the court below undertook to fix the master's compensation. From them appeals Nos. 750 and 751 were taken. They are discussed below.\n Appeals Nos. 752, 753, 832, 833, 844, and 845 bring up final decrees which declare the maximum rate prescribed by chapter 125, supra, confiscatory. Compensation allowed to the master is considered later. Concerning the merits little need be said. In each cause the controverted questions of fact were referred to a master, who took evidence and made reports supporting appellees' claims, and these were confirmed by the court. We are entirely satisfied with the ultimate conclusions, and none of the points relied upon are sufficient to justify general reversals. See Newton, Attorney General, v. Consolidated Gas Co., supra.\n The Attorney General and the Public Service Commission of New York were defendants in the eight cases; the district attorney of New York county was defendant in Nos. 750, 832, 833, 844, and 845; the district attorney of the county of Bronx in Nos. 752, 753, and 833; and the district attorney of the county of Queens in Nos. 751 and 845.\n By separate orders A. S. Gilbert, Esq., was appointed master in all of the causes and directed to take proof and report. His compensation and disbursements were determined and allowed by timely decrees entered in December, 1921, after all his reports had come in, and evidently upon a view of the whole litigation. It was also ordered that such sum 'shall be paid in the first instance by the complainant and shall be taxed as costs to be paid equally by the defendants.' The disbursements are not questioned, but the several allowances for compensation are challenged as excessive and unreasonable.\n No appeal has been taken by the Public Service Commission or by any of the gas companies (complainants \n\n[259 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n below) from the orders touching the matter of compensation.\n Detailed statements filed by the master show the nature and responsibility of his duties, the number of hours occupied on specified dates in hearings, preparing opinions, etc., with the equivalent number of days, reckoned at 5 hours each. It appears: That he was appointed in Charles D. Newton et al. v. Consolidated Gas Co., May 16, 1919, and by subsequent decrees in the other causes; that 192 days (5 hours) were devoted to the cause wherein the Consolidated Gas Company was complainant ( No. 750) and $57,500 allowed as compensation therefor; that 30 days were devoted to the cause wherein the New York & Queens Gas Company was complainant (No. 751), and $12,500 allowed as compensation; that 22 days were given to cause No. 752, and $12,500 allowed as compensation; 8 days to cause No. 753, and $7,500 allowed as compensation; 9 days to cause No. 832, and $11,500 allowed as compensation; 7 days to cause No. 833, and $7, 500 allowed as compensation; 7 days to cause No. 844, and $4,500 allowed as compensation; and 7 days to cause No. 845, and $4,500 allowed as compensation. The eight causes occupied 282 'days of 5 hours each, based on the average court day in this district'; the total allowed compensation is $118,000. He began to hold hearings July 22, 1919; separate reports were submitted May 6, 1920, July 19, 1920, February 16, 1921, and (the final ones) July 29, 1921. The record in the Consolidated Gas Company Case ( No. 750) is very large, 20,000 printed pages, in the New York & Queens Gas Company Case (No. 751) it is approximately 2,000 pages, and in the remaining six cases the records contain from 1,417 to 2,929 pages.\n Equity rule 68 (33 Sup. Ct. xxxviii) provides:\n'The District Court may ... appoint a master pro hac vice in any particular case. The compensation to be allowed to every master shall be fixed by the District Court, in its discretion, having \n\n[259 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n regard to all the circumstances thereof, and the compensation shall be charged upon and borne by such of the parties in the cause as the court shall direct.'\n\n Discretion within intendment of the rule is a judicial one; it does not extend to arbitrary and unreasonable action; and our review is limited to the question of its improvident exercise.\n The value of a capable master's services cannot be determined with mathematical accuracy, and estimates will vary, of course, according to the standard adopted. He occupies a position of honor, responsibility, and trust; the court looks to him to execute its decrees thoroughly, accurately, impartially, and in full response to the confidence extended; he should be adequately remunerated for actual work done, time employed, and the responsibility assumed. His compensation should be liberal, but not exorbitant. The rights of those who ultimately pay must be carefully protected; and while salaries prescribed by law for judicial officers performing similar duties are valuable guides, a higher rate of compensation is generally necessary in order to secure ability and experience in an exacting and temporary employment which often seriously interferes with other undertakings. See Finance Committee of Pennsylvania v. Warren, 82 Fed. 525, 527, 27 C. C. A. 475; Middleton v. Bankers' & Merchants' Tel. Co. (C. C.) 32 Fed. 524, 525.\n Having regard to these general principles and the special value of knowledge possessed by the trial court, much weight must be given to its opinion. Ordinarily we may not substitute our judgment for its deliberate conclusions, nor interfere with the exercise of its discretion. But when that court falls into error which amounts to abuse of discretion and the cause comes here by proper proceedings, appropriate relief must be granted.\n Notwithstanding protracted, painstaking, and for the most part excellent services rendered by the master and the large amounts involved in these causes, after viewing \n\n[259 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n the records and considering the circumstances disclosed, we cannot doubt that the allowances are much too large-certainly twice and three times what they should be. If the time devoted to the entire service-282 days-be accepted as equivalent to one year, the total allowance is 15 times the salary of the trial judge and 8 times that received by justices of this court. It may be compared to the compensation of the mayor of New York City, $15,000, the salaries of the Governor and members of the Court of Appeals of New York, $10,000, and the $17,500 paid to judges of the Supreme Court in the city of New York. Although none of these can be taken as a rigid standard, they are to be considered when it becomes necessary to determine what shall be paid to an attorney called to assist the court. His duties are not more onerous or responsible than those often performed by judges.\n So far as the several decrees undertake to adjudicate the master's compensation they will be reversed and the causes remanded with instructions to fix the same within the following limitations: In the cause wherein the Consolidated Gas Company is appellee here (No. 750) not exceeding $28,750-one-half of the amount heretofore allowed; in each of the other seven causes, Nos. 751, 752, 753, 832, 833, 844, and 845, not exceeding one-third of the amount heretofore allowed therein; and in the eight cases allowances totaling not more than $49,250. Such further action in conformity with this opinion as may be necessary shall also be taken.\n Appellants will pay the costs of appeals Nos. 750 and 751, with the right to claim credit therefor upon any judgment hereafter entered against them on account of the master's compensation. The costs in the remaining causes will be taxed against the appellants.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEWTON v.

WHITE(1922)\nNo. 176\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jackson H. Ralston, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 27, 1919, five persons of the Chinese race, of whom four are petitioners herein, joined in an application for a writ of habeas corpus to the judge of the federal court for the Southern Division of the Northern District \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n of California. A writ issued, directed to the Commissioner of Immigration for the Port of San Francisco, who held the petitioners in custody under warrants of deportation of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 19 of the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 889 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4jj). The case was heard upon the original files of the Bureau of Immigration, containing the record of the deportation proceedings. Each petitioner had entered the United States before May 1, 1917, the effective date of the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, and within five years of the commencement of the deportation proceedings. As to each the warrant of deportation recited that the petitioner was a native of China, was found to have secured his admission by fraud, and was found within the United States in violation of section 6 of the Chinese Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892, c. 60, 27 Stat. 25, as amended by Act Nov. 3, 1893, c. 14,  1, 28 Stat. 7 (Comp. St.  4320), being a Chinese laborer not in possession of a certificate of residence. The District Court entered an order quashing the writ and remanding the prisoners to the custody of the immigration authorities. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, except as to one appellant, who was ordered released. 266 Fed. 765. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n254 U.S. 628\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 148.\n There is a faint contention, which we deem unfounded, that the petitioners were not given a fair hearing, and that there is no evidence to sustain the findings of the immigration official. The contention mainly urged is that any violation of the Chinese Exclusion Laws1 of which petitioners \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n may be guilty occurred prior to the effective date of the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917; that, consequently, petitioners were not subject to its provision authorizing deportation on executive orders; and that under the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Acts they could be deported only upon judicial proceedings. In certain respects the situation of two of the petitioners differs from that of the other two, and to that extent their rights require separate consideration.\n First. As to Ng Fung Ho and Ng Yuen Shew, his minor son, the question presented is solely one of statutory construction. Deportation under provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Acts can be had only upon judicial proceedings; that is, upon a warrant issued by a justice, judge, or commissioner of a United States court upon a complaint and returnable before such court, or a justice, judge, or commissioner thereof. From an order of deportation entered by a commissioner an appeal is provided to the District Court, and from there to the Circuit Court of Appeals. United States, Petitioner, \n194 U.S. 194\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 629. We held in United States v. Woo Jan, \n245 U.S. 552\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 207, that section 21 of the General Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898, which authorized deportation of aliens on executive orders, did not apply to violators of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, and that they continued to enjoy the right to a judicial hearing. The 1907 act remained in force until May 1, 1917, when the General Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, became operative. Section 19 of the latter act also provides for deportation of aliens on executive orders. The question is: Did the act of 1917 also preserve to Chinese the exceptional right to a judicial hearing, as distinguished from an executive hearing?\n Petitioners practically concede that Chinese who first entered the United States after April 30, 1917, are subject to deportation under the provisions of section 19; but they insist that the rights and liabilities of those who entered before \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n May 1, 1917, are governed wholly by the Chinese Exclusion Acts, and that these remain entitled to a judicial hearing. The mere fact that at the time petitioners last entered the United States they could not have been deported, except by judicial proceedings, presents no constitutional obstacle to their expulsion by executive order now. Neither Ng Fung Ho nor Ng Yuen Shew claims to be a citizen of the United States. Congress has power to order at any time the deportation of aliens whose presence in the country it deems hurtful, and may do so by appropriate executive proceedings. Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 U.S. 585\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 607; Lapina v. Williams, \n232 U.S. 78\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 196; Lewis v. Frick, \n233 U.S. 291\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 488. Our task, therefore, so far as concerns these two petitioners, is merely to ascertain the intention of Congress.\n Petitioners argue that to hold section 19 of the 1917 act applicable to them would give it retroactive operation, contrary to the expressed intention of Congress. They rely particularly on the clauses in section 38 ( section 4289 1\/4u) which declare that 'as to all ... acts, things, or matters,' 'done or existing at the time of the taking effect of this \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 1917]\n\u00a0\n act' the 'laws ... amended ... are hereby continued in force.' \n2\n The government, on the other hand, insists that \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n section 19 was intended to operate retroactively, and to cover acts done prior to its going into effect, provided deportation proceedings were begun within five years after entry. But its main contention rests upon the fact that here the arrest and deportation are based, not merely upon unlawful entry, but upon the unlawful remaining of the petitioners after May 1, 1917. For the charge as to each is:\n'That he has been found within the United States in violation of section 6, Chinese Exclusion Act of May 5, 1892, as amended by the Act of November 3, 1893, being a Chinese laborer not in possession of a certificate of residence.'\n\n Unlawful remaining of an alien in the United States is an offense distinct in its nature from unlawful entry into the United States. One who has entered lawfully may remain unlawfully. This is expressly recognized in section 6 of the Act of May 5, 1892, under which the deportations here in question were sought. See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 1016; Li Sing v. United States, \n180 U.S. 486\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 449; Ah How v. United States, \n193 U.S. 65\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 357. A different rule might apply if the statute had so connected the two offenses that there could not be an unlawful remaining unless there had been an unlawful entry. Compare section 1 of the Act of May 6, 1882, c. 126, 22 Stat. 58. As we agree with the government that the orders of deportation were valid, because these petitioners were then unlawfully within the United States, we have no occasion to consider its further contention that Congress intended section 19 to be broadly retroactive.\n Second. As to Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo a constitutional question also is presented. Each claims to be \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n a foreign-born son of a native-born citizen, and hence, under section 1993 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  3947), to be himself a citizen of the United States. They insist that, since they claim to be citizens, Congress was without power to authorize their deportation by executive order. If at the time of the arrest they had been in legal contemplation without the borders of the United States, seeking entry, the mere fact that they claimed to be citizens woud not have entitled them under the Constitution to a judicial hearing. United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 U.S. 253\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 644; Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 U.S. 673\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 359. But they were not in the position of persons stopped at the border when seeking to enter this country. Nor are they in the position of persons who entered surreptitiously. See United States v. Wong You, \n223 U.S. 67\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 195. They arrived at San Francisco, a regularly designated port of entry, were duly taken to the immigration station, and, after a protracted personal examination, supplemented by the hearing of witnesses and the examination of reports of immigration officials, were ordered admitted as citizens. Then they applied for and received their certificates of identity. Fifteen months after the entry of one and six months after the entry of the other, both were arrested, on the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, in Arizona, where they were than living.\n The constitutional question presented as to them is: May a resident of the United States who claims to be a citizen be arrested and deported on executive order? The proceeding is obviously not void ab initio. United States v. Sing Tuck, \n194 U.S. 161\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 621. But these petitioners did not merely assert a claim of citizenship. They supported the claim by evidence sufficient, if believed, to entitle them to a finding of citizenship. The precise question is: Does the claim of citizenship by a resident, so supported both before the immigration officer and upon petition for a writ of habeas corpus, entitle him to a judicial trial of this claim?- \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n The question suggests-but is different from-another concerning deportation proceedings on which there is much difference of opinion in the lower courts, namely: whether the provision which puts upon the detained the burden of establishing his right to remain (see section 3 of the Act of May 5, 1892 [Comp. St.  4317]; Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 U.S. 193\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 891; Ah How v. United States, \n193 U.S. 65\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 357) applies where one resident within the country is arrested under the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Law and claims American citizenship. \n3\n There the proceeding for deportation is judicial in its nature. It is commenced usually before a commissioner of the court, but on appeal to the District Court additional evidence may be introduced, and the trial is de novo. Liu Hop Fong v. United States, \n209 U.S. 453\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 576. The constitutional question presented in those cases is merely how far the Legislature may go in prescribing rules of evidence and burden of proof in judicial proceedings. \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 729\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 1016; Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 451; Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 26\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 10; Hawes v. Georgia, \n258 U.S. 1\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 204, 66 L. Ed. --, decided February 27, 1922. Here the proceeding is throughout executive in its nature.\n Jurisdiction in the executive to order deportation exists only if the person arrested is an alien. The claim of citizenship is thus a denial of an essential jurisdictional fact. The situation bears some resemblance to that which arises where one against whom proceedings are being taken under the military law denies that he is in the military service. It is well settled that in such a case a writ of habeas corpus will issue to determine the status. Ex parte Reed, \n100 U.S. 13\n; In re Grimley, \n137 U.S. 147\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 54; In re Morrissey, \n137 U.S. 157\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 57; Johnson v. Sayre, \n158 U.S. 109\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 773. Compare Ex parte Crow Dog, \n109 U.S. 556\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 396. If the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor may not be tested in the courts by means of the writ of habeas corpus, when the prisoner claims citizenship and makes a showing that his claim is not frivolous, then obviously deportation of a resident may follow upon a purely executive order, whatever his race or place of birth; for, where there is jurisdiction, a finding of fact by the executive department is conclusive (United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 U.S. 253\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 644), and courts have no power to interfere, unless there was either denial of a fair hearing (Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 U.S. 8\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 201), or the finding was not supported by evidence (American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 33), or there was an application of an erroneous rule of law (Gegiow v. Uhl, \n239 U.S. 3\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 2).\n To deport one who so claims to be a citizen obviously deprives him of liberty, as was pointed out in Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 13\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 201. It may result also in loss of both property and life, or of all that makes life worth living. Against the danger of such deprivation without the sanction afforded by judicial proceedings, the Fifth \n\n[259 U.S. 276, 285]\n\u00a0\n Amendment affords protection in its guarantee of due process of law. The difference in security of judicial over administrative action has been adverted to by this court. Compare United States v. Woo Jan, \n245 \nU.S. 552, 556\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 207; White v. Chin Fong, \n258 \nU.S. 90, 93\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 449.\n It follows that Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo are entitled to a judicial determination of their claims that they are citizens of the United States; but it does not follow that they should be discharged. The practice indicated in Chin Yow v. United States, supra, and approved in Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454, 465\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 566, should be pursued. Therefore, as to Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, for trial in that court of the question of citizenship, and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. As to Ng Fung Ho and Ng Yuen Shew, the judgment of the Circuit court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n Writ of habeas corpus to issue as to Gin Sang Get and Gin Sang Mo. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Act May 6, 1882, c. 126, 22 Stat. 58, as amended by Act July 5, 1884, c. 220, 23 Stat. 115 (Comp.

LEE(1922)\nNo. 33\nArgued: October 6, 1922Decided: October 16, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. S. R. Prince, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. C. Strudwick, of Greensboro, N. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Southern Railway includes a line in North Carolina which is held under a 99-year lease. On that line an employee was killed in March, 1919- apparently while engaged in intrastate commerce. His administratrix brought, in a court of the state, this action for damages, alleging that the line was then being operated \n\n[260 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n by the Southern as lessee, and that the lessee's negligence in operation caused the injury. Only the lessor, the North Carolina Railroad Company, was made defendant. Its liability was asserted under a local rule by which a railroad corporation is liable for injuries resulting from a lessee's negligence in operation. Logan v. Railroad, 116 N. C. 940, 21 S. E. 959. The defendant set up the fact that, at the time of the accident, the Southern System was being operated solely by the Director General of Railroads under the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451. (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p). On that ground it requested a ruling that the plaintiff could not recover. This request was refused; and the court instructed the jury that, if the government was operating the railroad, it was doing so in the capacity of a lessee and that the defendant 'would still be responsible for the acts and conduct of the government at the time it was operating' the same. The verdict was for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of North Carolina without opinion. This court granted a writ of certiorari, \n255 U.S. 567\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 447. Thereafter, the liability of carriers during federal control was considered in Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593\n\n\n The government operated this railroad not as lessee but under a right in the nature of eminent domain. It operated through the Director General, not through the Southern Company as agent. The Ault Case holds that the Director General alone was made subject, by section 10 of the Federal Control Act to the 'liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws or at common law.' To permit an action for injuries suffered during federal control to be brought either against the Southern Company as lessee, or against the North Carolina Company as lessor, would be inconsistent with the provisions of that act. This is now recognized by the \n\n[260 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of North Carolina. Lane v. Southern R. Co., 182 N. C. 774, 109 S. E. 87; Barbee v. North Carolina R. Co., 182 N.

STATE OF OKL.(1922)\nNo. 37\nArgued: March 7, 1922Decided: March 20, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. C. B. Ames and D. A. Richardson, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles H. Ruth, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Error to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma sustaining an order of the Corporation Commission of the state directing, on account of the failure of the gas companies to furnish adequate gas service, a refund in certain districts of Oklahoma City of from 8 to 25 per cent. of the bills rendered by the companies during December, 1917, and January, 1918\n\n\n The initial steps in the proceedings against the gas companies were petitions filed before the Corporation \n\n[258 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n Commission of the state, and numbered 3188, 3192 and 3197. They charged that the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company was a corporation of Oklahoma, and was granted a franchise by Oklahoma City to supply the latter and its inhabitants with natural gas for light, heat and power, and as such corporation, exercised the right of eminent domain. And they alleged that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company was also a corporation of Oklahoma for the purpose of transporting gas from Cushing, Okl., to Oklahoma City, and was under contract to deliver gas to the pipe lines of the gas and electric company.\n The petitions represented in various ways in what the two companies were deficient and delinquent in the execution of the purpose of their incorporation in the supply of gas at certain times to those entitled to be served, and the prayers of the petitions varied according to the respective standpoints of the petitioners and their conceptions of remedies.\n In No. 3188 it was prayed that the companies reveal their relationship and contracts in regard to supplying Oklahoma City with gas, and that the electric company show the daily consumption of gas by the city, the volume and pressure in ounces necessary to provide adequate service. There was the further prayer that the companies be required to provide and maintain gas storage facilities.\n In No. 3192 it was prayed that the electric company be restrained from forcing collection of gas bills before the determination of the issue presented, the charge being that notwithstanding the insufficiency of the gas supply, the company was threatening to require prompt payment of bills and in default thereof to discontinue service.\n In No. 3197 (it was presented by the county attorney and his assistants) the relief asked was that the Commission take charge and management of the corporations; \n\n[258 U.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n they being delinquent in their duties. It was also prayed that the companies be declared in contempt of an order of the Commission previously rendered which required such efficiency in the distributing systems as to render adequate service, and dealt with accordingly.\n Separate answers were made by the companies in Nos. 3188 and 3197. In No. 3192 the electric company alone answered.\n Each company averred the exertion of all means within its power to supply the needs and requirements of the city with gas and was specific in the enumeration of its facilities and powers and their exertion, and denied faults and delinquencies.\n The Corporation Commission by the Constitution and laws of the state is given power and authority, and is charged with the duty of supervising and regulating transportation companies and other public utilities, and given the same authority to prescribe rates which the state might prescribe or make. And the Supreme Court decided that any of the orders of the Commission prescribing rates and regulating the service of such utilities are as much a law of the state as if enacted by the Legislature, and that a public utility in furnishing natural gas is as much subject to the provisions of such orders as if they had been made an integral part of the contract between the consumer and the public utility.\n It was in view of the jurisdiction and powers of the Commission that the petitions in this case were presented to it. They were consolidated and testimony taken for and against them and the Commission set forth its conclusion in an opinion of great length- too long, we may say, to make even a summary of it practicable.\n We can only say that the Commission found the quality of the gas deficient but otherwise found for the companies. For instance, the Commission found that storage facilities for a reserve supply as prayed were impossible. It found \n\n[258 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n also against the charge that the companies had been guilty of negligence for failure to extend their lines to other and more abundant sources of supply. Indeed, the Commission, intimating a doubt of its power to do so, refused to exercise the power against the companies, circumstances not demanding it.\n The final order of the Commission was that discounts of various amounts from the payments made by consumers in certain districts (they were named) should be allowed. The discount, it was ordered, should be applied to bills for domestic consumption of gas only, and this consumption was considered to mean only gas used for physical comfort or for cooking in residences.\n The prayer in No. 3197 that the Commission take charge and operate the property of the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company was denied; also that fines for contempt be imposed was denied.\n There were modifications of the order not necessary to mention. On error to the Supreme Court by the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company the order of the Commission was affirmed.\n The Supreme Court in its opinion stated the points in litigation, and said it was not controverted that the service was inadequate; the contention of the gas company being that--\n'Natural gas is a commodity for which the utilities are entitled to payment on a quantum basis, as shown by meter readings, and the adequacy and inadequacy of service does not enter into the payment of bills.'\n\n The court rejected the contention and affirmed the order of the Commission expressing its, the court's, understanding of it to be that--\n It proceeded 'upon the theory that, inasmuch as the maximum compensation of the gas company is allowed upon the basis of adequate service, where the service is not kept to this standard the rate charged the public should be graded in proportion to the falling off in effici- \n\n[258 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n ency.'\n Stating a further contention of the company in resistance to the order of the Commission, the court said it seemed to be that the company was entitled to the maximum rate 'regardless of the efficiency of the service.' The court rejected the contention considering that the rule announced by the Commission was 'entirely just and reasonable, provided a practical basis for its application' could 'be established,' and the court said it could 'see no insuperable barrier in the way of doing' that. And the court further decided that the Commission had correctly solved the problem by basing the proportion of the maximum rate the company could justly collect from the public upon the quality of the service rendered as well as upon the quantity of gas furnished. And this solution of the problem, the court was of the view, the evidence supported.\n The company assails the reasoning and conclusions of the court and Commission and asserts that they penalize the company 'for failing to supply gas which nature had not produced.' It supplied, is the contention, the maximum amount which it could produce, and the Commission found that it was not negligent in failing to supply more. It is the contention, therefore, that the order of the Commission and the action of the Supreme Court in sustaining it, are offensive to the Constitution of the United States.\n The contention is based on a wrong estimate of the action of the Commission and that of the court. Neither was based on deficiency in the volume of gas, but upon the failure of the company to transport it under sufficient pressure to render efficient service. It was the view of the Commission and the court that the company owed efficient service and for failing to supply it there should be a deduction in the compensation charged in proportion to the deficiency.\n The company assails both conclusions as depriving it of property without due process of law. We cannot assent. \n\n[258 U.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n Both the Commission and the Supreme Court decided, construing the charter of the company, that it, the company, was required to render efficient service, and we concur in that view, and that it was competent for the state to compensate the deficiency in the service-deficiency in the supply of gas-by a rebate of the payments to the company. The percentage of reduction and its adequate relation to a deficiency in service were necessarily determined by the Commission from the case as presented to it, and the Supreme Court upon consideration affirmed the determination as a just and supported relation. In the judgments of the Commission and the court we are unable to see error, certainly not an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We repeat, therefore, the action of the Commission and Court were not, as represented by the company, a requirement of the impossible. It was simply and clearly the determination of what the franchise of the company required and the obligation to perform it, and the failure to perform justified a reduction of the fees charged or if paid a proportionate repayment.\n We are not called upon, therefore, to review or answer the interesting argument of the company based upon the contention that the order of the Commission imposed upon the company the impossible or the unreasonable. It imposed, we repeat, the performance of the service that the gas company had agreed to perform.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLIN v.

Fenton, both of Portland, Or., for appellant.\n Messrs. Willis S. Moore and W. W. Banks, both of Portland, Or., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bill was dismissed upon motion by the trial court for want of equity and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this action. 268 Fed. 348.\n Appellant-a native of Russia who has declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States-claims the right to fish in specified locations in the Columbia river and seeks a mandatory injunction requiring the master fish warden and other officers of Oregon to issue a license therefor.\n His prayer is based upon the theory that so much of chapter 292, General Laws of Oregon 1919, as directs that no fishing license 'shall be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the United States' impairs the obligation (Const. art. 1,  10) of the compact and agreement between \n\n[259 U.S. 260, 262]\n\u00a0\n the states of Washington and Oregon ratified by an Act of Congress approved April 8, 1918-40 Stat. 515, c. 47-which follows:\n'The Congress of the United States of America hereby consents to and ratifies the compact and agreement entered into between the states of Oregon and Washington relative to regulating, protecting, and preserving fish in the boundary waters of the Columbia river and other waters, which compact and agreement is contained in section twenty of chapter one hundred and eighty-eight of the general laws of Oregon for nineteen hundred and fifteen, and section one hundred and sixteen, chapter thirty-one, of the session laws of Washington for nineteen hundred and fifteen, and is as follows:\n\n\"All laws and regulations now existing, or which may be necessary for regulating, protecting, or preserving fish in the waters of the Columbia river, over which the states of Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction, or any other waters within either of said states, which would affect said concurrent jurisdiction, shall be made, changed, altered, and amended in whole or in part, only with the mutual consent and approbation of both states.'\n\n'Nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect the right of the United States to regulate commerce, or the jurisdiction of the United States over navigable waters.'\n\n The statutes in which the states accepted the compact are not identical, but each one provides:\n'No license for taking or catching salmon or other food or shell fish, required by laws of this state, shall be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the United States, unless such person has declared his intention to become a citizen, and is and has been an actual resident of the state for one year immediately preceding the application for such license, nor shall any license be issued to a corporation unless it is authorized to do business in this state.' Oregon Act (Laws 1915, p. 227)  5-Washington Act (Laws 1915, p. 82)  43. \n\n[259 U.S. 260, 263]\n\u00a0\n Appellant's postulate is that the quoted provision read in connection with the compact inhibits each state from restricting its fishing licenses to citizens of the United States without consent of the other. If this is unsound, no foundation exists for his claim and all other questions may be disregarded.\n\n Considering the object and nature of the compact and the two acts of 1915, we cannot conclude that the parties intended by the identical provision to obligate themselves to issue any fishing license; the purpose was to limit the classes of persons who might have them-beyond which the state might not go. There is no inhibition against narrowing these classes nor indeed against a refusal to issue any license. The Oregon Legislature acted in harmony with the compact when it excluded aliens; there was no impairment, and the judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOREGON-WASHINGTON R. & NAV. CO. v. MCGINN(1922)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 409, 410]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. R. Harr, of Washington, D. C., and John F. Reilly, of Portland, Or., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. L. Edmiston, of Spokane, Wash., for respondent.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent shipped two carloads of horses from Grand Island, Neb., to Spokane, Wash., for which the initial carrier, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, issued a through bill of lading, in the form of the customary live stock contract, and routed the shipment over its own lines to Granger, Wyo., thence over the line of the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company to Huntington, Or., and thence over the lines of petitioner to Spokane, Wash.\n While in transit the animals developed disease, which resulted in the death of several and in such condition of the others that they were delivered to the shipper consignee on the line of the petitioner before reaching the destination to which they were billed. The illness is alleged to have been caused by the stock having been given unwholesome food and water at Pocatello, Idaho, a station on the line of the intermediate carrier, the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company.\n This suit to recover damages is against the delivering, the terminal, carrier; the allegation of the complaint, however, being that the unwholesome food and water were given to the stock while in transit over the route of the intermediate carrier, the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company. Thus we have presented for decision the question: Is a terminal carrier liable to a shipper who, in this case, is also the consignee, for injury to horses caused by the negligence of a prior and independent carrier from which they were received?\n The live stock contract, under which the shipment moved contained the following provision:- \n\n[258 U.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. Except as otherwise provided by statute law, the carrier undertakes to transport said shipment only over its own line, and acts only as the agent of the shipper with respect to the portion of the route beyond its own line. No carrier shall be liable for damages for loss, death, injury or delay to said animals, or any thereof, not caused by it, but nothing contained in this contract shall be deemed to exempt the initial carrier in case of a through interstate transportation from any liability for loss, death, damage or injury caused by it or any common carrier, railroad or transportation company to which the livestock may be delivered under this contract.'\n\n It is plain that this paragraph was framed to comply with the requirements of the Cummins Amendment to the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (34 Stat.  20, 593, 595; 38 Stat. 1196, c. 176 [ Comp. St.  8604a]); but, except as therein provided, the initial carrier limits its undertaking to its own line, declares that it acts only as the agent of the shipper with respect to the route beyond its own line, and the express contract is that 'no carrier shall be liable for damages for loss, death, injury or delay to said animals not caused by it.'\n A verdict was rendered in favor of the shipper consignee, subject to the court's action on a question reserved by stipulation of the parties, and the court, acting thereunder, set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, and held that Georgia, Florida & Alabama Railway Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 U.S. 190\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 541, required that, under the Carmack (now Cummins) Amendment, the terminal carrier should be bound by the contract of the initial carrier to deliver, precisely as the initial carrier is bound, and was therefore liable for any loss or damage to the property that had been occasioned in transit through the conduct of any of the carriers. \n\n[258 U.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n In this we think the Circuit Court of Appeals fell into error.\n The settled federal rule is that, in the absence of statute or special contract, each connecting carrier on a through route is bound only to safely carry over its own line and safely deliver to the next connecting carrier, Myrick v. Michigan Central Railroad Co., \n107 \nU.S. 102, 107\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 425; Railroad Co. v. Manufacturing Co., 16 Wall. 318, 324; and the liability of a connecting carrier for the safety of property delivered to it for transportation, commences when it is received and is discharged by its delivery to and acceptance by a succeeding carrier, or its authorized agent, Pratt v. Railway Co., \n95 U.S. 43\n.\n The Cummins Amendment deals with and modifies the common-law liability only of the initial carrier. It renders that carrier liable for loss or damage to the property committed to its care throughout the entire route by which it is billed until delivered to the consignee, but it leaves the relation of all connecting carriers, including the terminal carrier, to the suipper or consignee and to each other, entirely unaffected (Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 195\n, 196 S., 197, 31 Sup. Ct. 164, 31 L. R. A. [N. S.] 7; Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 511\n, 44 S. L. R. A. [N. S.] 257), and therefore their liability is as we have stated it unless modified by contract, and in this case, as we have seen, the live stock contract, under which the shipment moved, by expressly providing that 'no carrier (other than the initial carrier) shall be liable for damage for loss, death, injury or delay to said animals, or any thereof, not caused by it' leaves the common-law liability of the intermediate carrier entirely unaffected, just as the statute leaves it.\n The Blish Case, supra, was against the terminal carrier, and one contention in that case was that under the Carmack (now Cummins) Amendment the shipper's remedy against the initial carrier was exclusive, even where the \n\n[258 U.S. 409, 414]\n\u00a0\n default claimed was misdelivery by the terminal carrier. In denying this, this court said:\n'The connectingcarrier is not relieved from liability by the Carmack [ Cummins] Amendment, but the bill of lading required to be issued by the initial carrier upon an interstate shipment governs the entire transportation and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to the extent that the terms of the bill of lading are applicable and valid.'\n\n We have seen that the amendment did not alter the common-law liability of other than the initial carrier, and in this case the 'applicable and valid' terms of the bill of lading, expressly negative liability of any connecting carrier for damage not caused by it.\n The other contention in the Blish Case, supra, was that the action was barred because notice of claim, in writing, had not been given within the time required by the bill of lading.\n In the discussion of this question this Court used the language following, by which the Circuit Court of Appeals was misled, viz.:\n'When it [the initial carrier] inserts in its bill of lading a provision requiring reasonable notice of claims 'in case of failure to make delivery' the fair meaning of the stipulation is that it includes all cases of such failure, as well those due to misdelivery as those due to the loss of the goods. But the provision in question is not to be construed in one way with respect to the initial carrier and in another with respect to the connecting or terminal carrier. As we have said. the latter takes the goods under the bill of lading issued by the initial carrier, and its obligations are measured by its terms; and if the clause must be deemed to cover a case of misdelivery when the action is brought against the initial carrier, it must equally have that effect in the case of the terminal \n\n[258 U.S. 409, 415]\n\u00a0\n carrier which in the contemplation of the parties was to make the delivery.'\n\n From this language the Circuit Court of Appeals concludes that under the amendment the terminal carrier is bound, by the bill of lading and the contract of the initial carrier, to deliver as the initial carrier is bound, and is therefore liable for any loss or damage to the property which has been occasioned through the conduct of any of the carriers while in transit, and this led the court to the holding that the terminal carrier was liable for the loss and injury 'although occasioned while in transit over the Oregon Short Line.'\n We think the Circuit Court of Appeals misinterpreted the only relevant expression in the above quotation from the language by this court, viz.:\n The terminal carrier 'takes the goods under the bill of lading issued by the initial carrier, and its obligations are measured by its terms; and if the clause must be deemed to cover a case of misdelivery when the action is brought against the initial carrier, it must equally have that effect in the case of the terminal carrier which in the contemplation of the parties was to make the delivery.'\n What was decided in the Blish Case was that the terminal carrier was liable for failure to make delivery, just as the initial carrier would have been if it had been sued for misdelivery, because by the terms of the bill of lading each was under obligation to make final delivery. The suit before us is not for misdelivery or other fault of the carrier sued, but for the fault, as alleged, of a prior connecting carrier. In express terms the bill of lading we have here declares that no carrier shall be liable for loss or damage not caused by it, and, therefore, the statute not providing otherwise, the petitioner cannot be liable for the damage alleged to have been caused before the stock reached its one. \n\n[258 U.S. 409, 416]\n\u00a0\n The Carmack and Cummins Amendments were enacted to enable the holder of a bill of lading to sue the initial carrier for any loss or damage to property suffered on any part of a through route, and thereby to relieve him from the necessity of searching out and proving a case against a terminal or intermediate carrier. \n219 U.S. 186\n, supra, page 200, 31 Sup. Ct. 164, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 7. Having regard to the customary methods of doing a through business in this country it may have been important to have given like rights against others of connecting carriers, but plainly, either from design or accident, the terms of the amendment limit its application to the initial carrier.\n We think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was mistaken in its interpretation of the language used in the Blish Case opinion, and its judgment must be reversed and the judgment of the District Court affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nORTEGA CO. v. TRIAY(1922)\nNo. 75\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Herman Ulmer and W. T. Stockton, both of Jacksonville, Fla., for appellant. \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Peter O. Knight, of Tampa, Fla., and J. L. Doggett, of Jacksonville, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is in narrow compass. Its purpose is to enjoin the appellee, as receiver of the Jacksonville Traction Company, grantee of the Jacksonville Electric Company as hereinafter stated and a corporation of Massachusetts, from collecting more than a particular fare, 5 cents, and compelling the specific performance of an alleged contract providing for such fare.\n The grounds of the suit are set forth with great detail but may be epitomized narratively as follows: The Ortega Company was in 1910 and prior thereto the owner, and operated a line of electric railroad from the city of Jacksonville to a point in a place designated as Ortega in Duval county, Fla. The Ortega Company sold the railroad to R. J. Richardson, February 12, 1910, in pursuance of a contract, and March 6, 1911, Richardson and his wife conveyed the railroad to the Jacksonville Traction Company. Richardson was at all the times agent of the Jacksonville Electric Company.\n The conveyance from the Ortega Company contained, among other provisions, the following covenant:\n'The Jacksonville Electric Company further covenants and agrees that said street railroad shall be operated in such manner that passengers for a single fare of 5 cents may travel from any point reached by street cars in the city of Jacksonville to the terminus in Ortega and vice versa, over the lines of the Jacksonville Electric Company, and the line conveyed by the Ortega Company.'\n\n And it was covenanted that--\n'Said single fare of 5 cents shall be sufficient compensation for a continuous journey either way, with such transfers as may be necessary.' \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n The Jacksonville Electric Company went into the possession of the railroad and operated it as agreed upon the basis of a 5-cent fare.\n\n At the time of the conveyance, the railroad and its appurtenances were reasonably of the value of $33,157.37, and the conveyance was made in consideration of the covenant and a cash consideration of $10,000, less certain deductions. The cash consideration was of minor import; the principal consideration was the covenant.\n At the time of making the contract with the Electric Company, the Ortega Company was engaged in the development of a large tract of land lying in Duval county at the terminus of the Ortega line, and the company sold the railroad for approximately $26,000 less than its reasonable value upon the express covenant of the Electric Company to operate the line upon a 5-cent basis. The continued violation of the covenant will deprive the Ortega Company of property worth many thousand dollars, and will result in irreparable injury to the company, 'the nature and character of which injury redress at law would be uncertain and inadequate and the damages resulting therefrom impossible of ascertainment.'\n April 18, 1911, the Jacksonville Electric Company conveyed the railroad to the Jacksonville Traction Company and that company went into possession of the road and operated it in accordance with the covenant.\n On October 30, 1919, appellee Triay was appointed receiver of the Traction Company and ever since has been, and still is, acting as receiver, managing and operating the railways and properties of the Traction Company, including the Ortega line.\n From the time of the conveyance to the Jacksonville Electric Company until December 15, 1920, that company and the Traction Company and appellee, as receiver, successively operated the road on a 5-cent basis.\n On the ---- day of January, 1920, appellee filed with the Railroad Commission of Florida a petition asking that \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n the Commission assume jurisdiction of the rates and fares of the Traction Company and authorize an increase in them. The request was granted December 2, 1920, and a fare of 7 cents was authorized and has since been charged.\n The Railroad Commission was created by the Legislature of the state in 1897 (Laws 1897, c. 4549) and was required (by the same law passed) in the same year, to 'make reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariffs to be observed by all railroad companies and all others engaged as common carriers doing business in this state.' Acts 1897, c. 4549. The requirement was repeated by an act passed in 1913 (Acts 1913, c. 6527), and by the latter act it was made the duty of the Commission to make reasonable and just rules and regulations to enforce the observance by the carriers of their tariffs.\n The only provision of the Constitution of the state dealing with the powers of the Legislature is section 30 of article 16 which provides as follows:\n'The Legislature is invested with full power to pass laws for the correction of abuses and to prevent unjust discrimination and excessive charges by persons and corporations engaged as common carriers in transporting persons and property, or performing other services of a pubic nature, and shall provide for enforcing such laws by adequate penalties or forfeitures.'\n\n By reason of the constitutional provision and limitation, so much, the petition proceeds, of the legislative provisions above stated, as attempts to confer upon the Commission the power to increase the rates and charges of appellee, is unconstitutional and void and the order of the Commission is void and of no effect, and impairs the obligation of the contract between the Ortega Company and the Electric Company and constitutes a taking of the property of the Ortega Company without due process of law contrary to the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n An injunction was prayed pending the suit and that appellee be compelled to operate the Ortega line at a 5-cent fare as covenanted and that the Ortega Company be granted such further relief as proper and agreeable to equity.\n A motion to dismiss the bill for want of equity was made upon the ground that under the laws and Constitution of Florida the Railroad Commission had the power it exercised in authorizing the Traction Company to increase the fares and charges from 5 cents to 7 cents, and that such power since the adoption of the Constitution in 1885 could not be limited by private contract rights; such rights necessarily yielding to the public welfare as expressed in the laws and Constitution of the state.\n The court took that view and, quoting section 30 of article 16 of the Constitution relied on by the Ortega Company, rejected that company's construction of it and decided that the Commission could raise as well as lower rates and that the Supreme Court of the state had so adjudged. The court, therefore, denied the motion of the Ortega Company for a temporary injunction and dismissed the bill.\n There are certain admissions of appellant that are pertinent to our consideration: (1) In the absence of constitutional restrictions, a state has the power to raise or lower rates of public utility corporations, and may exercise it through railroad commissions. (2) The power is not lessened or limited by the existence of private contracts. The power is considered as part of the contract. (3) The power exercised to either raise or lower a rate is not in itself and without more an impairment of the obligation of a contract or the taking of property withourt due process of law.\n This power, and its exercise, it is contended, is not applicable to the facts presented in the instant case \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n because under the Florida Constitution the Legislature is prohibited from increasing rates; it can only lower them. To support this view of the Constitution, appellant presents a somewhat elaborate and involved argument terminating in the assertion that section 30 of article 16 of the Comstitution grants the Legislature 'power to prevent excessive charges by common carriers.' And this, the further contention is, necessarily means the power to reduce, not to increase. In one direction only, is the contention, may the Legislature modify rates and 'that direction is down.' And it is added with emphasis, 'the power to prevent excessive charges, power to lower excessive charges, power to reduce excessive charges, all mean the same thing.'\n The power exercised by the Commission not being possessed, a valid contract, it is asserted, existed between the Ortega Company and the other companies and that 'the order of the Railroad Commission increasing the rate of fares impairs its obligation.' And a federal question is presented 'for this court to determine, unhampered by state decisions.'\n It is to be observed that section 30 of article 16 of the Constitution was adopted in 1885, that is, prior to the covenant relied on by the Ortega Company, and that also, prior to the covenant, the Railroad Commission was created and power given it to 'make reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariffs, to be observed by all railroads.' The contention is that, if the latter act be construed to give a greater power than section 30 gives, the act is void, and section 30 is only to be considered as constituting the obligation of the covenant and this court has the power to construe it 'unhampered by state decisions.'\n The contention is direct, and we may accept the power ascribed to us, and, exercising it, we say unhesitatingly that we concur with the District Court that under section 30 and the legislation of the state the Commission is competent \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n to increase as well as to decrease rates. And such we think, as the District Court decided, is the effect given section 30 and the legislation of the state by the Supreme Court of the state, although we cannot say that in any case there is a precise contrast between the power to increase as distinguished from the power to decrease rates, which is now the point in controversy. We think, however, the power to increase as well as to decrease rates is an inevitable deduction from the reasoning of the cases.\n In State ex rel. Railroad Commissioners v. A. C. L. R. Co., 60 Fla. 465, 54 South. 394, it was said that--\n'The Railroad Commissioners have such powers only as are expressly or impliedly conferred upon them by statute.'\n\n But, it was further said:\n'Authority that is indispensable or useful to the valid purposes of a remedial law may be inferred or implied from authority expressly given.'\n\n Applying this, it was further said that a 'wide discretion is accorded to them [the Railroad Commissioners] in the exercise of such authority.'\n In State of Florida ex rel. Railroad Commissioners v. A. C. L. R. Co., 61 Fla. 799. 54 South. 900, it was decided that the difficulty of enumerating all of the powers conferred upon the Commissioners in the interest of the general welfare made it necessary to confer some in general terms, 'and general powers given are intended to confer other powers than those specifically enumerated.'\n In State of Florida ex rel. Commissioners v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., 57 Fla. 522, 49 South. 43, section 30 of article 16 is quoted, and it was said of it that it was 'not a grant of power to the Legislature, nor is it a limitation upon the power of the Legislature, but it is an express recognition of a power existing in the legislative department of the state government.'\n It will be observed, therefore, that the Board of Railroad Commissioners is constituted by the Legislature, and that the powers are conferred upon the board in general \n\n[260 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n terms to be exercised in the public welfare, and a wide discretion is accorded it which is not constrained by peremptory directions. The powers are quasi legislative, the public welfare being their test and measure. State v. Railroad Commissioners, 79 Fla. 526, 84 South. 444, 446. There is nothing in the words 'excessive charges' in section 30 of article 16, nor in their context, that requires the regulation of the charges to be downward and not upward, if the charges authorized be not excessive.\n Necessarily, therefore, we affirm the action of the District Court; but, while this denies the relief the Ortega Company prays against appellee, we do not wish to be understood as adjudging that the company may not be entitled to some remedy for the nonobservance of the contract by the Traction Company.

LUCAS(1922)\nNo. 160\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles J. Heggerty, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frederick Clayton Peterson, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent. \n\n[258 U.S. 266, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel brought by the respondent to recover $219 for wages, subsistence and medical attendance, the libellant having been left at Honolulu, ill, in the course of a voyage from San Francisco to the Orient and return. The defense is that he was not ill, that ill or well he should have remained upon the vessel, and further that he was discharged, and signed the mutual release required by Rev. St.  4552 (Comp. St.  8341), and by that section made a bar. The Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the finding of the District Court that the libellant was not malingering, and, as we take it, although it is argued otherwise, also in finding that the doctor and master of the ship were willing that the libellant should go to the Marine Hospital. The only question that we see reason for considering is whether the two Courts were right in holding that the libellant was not concluded by the release.\n Both Courts have found that the respondent was only asked to sign for his wages, that a discharge was not mentioned, and to put it in our own way, that the purport of the overt acts in the circumstances was not to release the libellant's claim. The petitioner cites the words of Rev. St.  4552, and Rosenberg v. Doe, 146 Mass. 191, 15 N. E. 510, to show that such a position is impossible. But the same case at a later stage, 148 Mass. 560, 20 N. E. 176, admitted a different result, where the sailor knew too little English to understand the nature of the document and there was evidence that it was misstated to him. In the present case we have the further very important fact, which does not appear in the report of Rosenberg v. Doe, that the master did not give the respondent a certificate of discharge, as he was required to, under a penalty of fifty dollars, by Rev. St.  4551 (Comp. St.  8340), if the respondent really was discharged. Moreover, by a statute later in its present form than Rosenberg v. Doe, it is provided that notwithstanding the statutory \n\n[258 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n release 'any court having jurisdiction may upon good cause shown set aside such release and take such action as justice shall require.' Act of March 4, 1915, c. 153,  4; 38 Stat. 1164, 1165 (Comp. St.  8322). We are not prepared to say that the finding of the two Courts was wrong.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA COAL CO. v. MAHON(1922)\nNo. 549\nArgued: November 14, 1922Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and H. S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 393, 404]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. L. Pace, of Pittston, Pa., for defendants in error.\n Mr. Geo. Ross Hull, of Harrisburg, Pa., for State of Pennsylvania, as amicus curiae.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 393, 412]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house. The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface but in express terms reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same and the grantee takes the premises with the risk and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that whatever may have been the Coal Company's rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921 (P. L. 1198), commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that if not restrained the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought but denied an injunction, holding that the statute if applied to this case would be unconstitutional. On appeal the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power and directed a decree for the plaintiffs, A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.\n The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 413]\n\u00a0\n things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.\n Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.\n This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. Rideout v. Knox, 148 Mass. 368, 19 N. E. 390, 2 L. R. A. 81, 12 Am. St. Rep. 560. But usually in ordinary private affairs the public interest does not warrant much of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public. Wesson v. Washburn Iron Co., 13 Allen ( Mass.) 96, 103, 90 Am. Dec. 181. The extent of \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 414]\n\u00a0\n the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land-a very valuable estate-and what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the plaintiffs' position alone we should think it clear that the statute does not disclose a public interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of the defendant's constitutionally protected rights.\n But the case has been treated as one in which the general validity of the act should be discussed. The Attorney General of the State, the City of Scranton and the representatives of other extensive interests were allowed to take part in the argument below and have submitted their contentions here. It seems, therefore, to be our duty to go farther in the statement of our opinion, in order that it may be known at once, and that further suits should not be brought in vain.\n It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, 'For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it.' Commonwealth v. Clearview Coal Co., 256 Pa. 328, 331, 100 Atl. 820, L. R. A. 1917E, 672. What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. This \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 415]\n\u00a0\n we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.\n It is true that in Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 359, it was held competent for the legislature to require a pillar of coal to the left along the line of adjoining property, that with the pillar on the other side of the line would be a barrier sufficient for the safety of the employees of either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water. But that was a requirement for the safety of employees invited into the mine, and secured an average reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various laws.\n The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 598, 605\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.\n The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go-and if they go beyond the general rule, \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 416]\n\u00a0\n whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. Bowditch v. Boston, \n101 U.S. 16\n. In general it is not plain that a man's misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor's shoulders. Spade v. Lynn & Boston Ry. Co., 172 Mass. 488, 489, 52 N. E. 747, 43 L. R. A. 832, 70 Am. St. Rep. 298. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said this is a question of degree-and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They were to the verge of the law but fell far short of the present act. Block & Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 U.S. 170\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 465; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 U.S. 242\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 289, March 20, 1922\n\n\n We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting.\n The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in such a manner or to such an extent 'as to cause the ... \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 417]\n\u00a0\n subsidence of ... any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation, or any factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile establishment in which human labor is employed.' Act Pa. May 27, 1921,  1 ( P. L. 1198). Coal in place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the Legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation; and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\n Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatended is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious-as it may because of further change in local or social conditions-the restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy his property as heretofore.\n The restriction upon the use of this property cannot, of course, be lawfully imposed, unless its purpose is to protect the public. But the purpose of a restriction does not cease to be public, because incidentally some private \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 418]\n\u00a0\n persons may thereby receive gratuitously valuable special benefits. Thus, owners of low buildings may obtain, through statutory restrictions upon the height of neighboring structures, benefits equivalent to an easement of light and air. Welch v. Swasey, \n214 U.S. 91\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 567. Compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 U.S. 300\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 118. Furthermore, a restriction, though imposed for a public purpose, will not be lawful, unless the restriction is an appropriate means to the public end. But to keep coal in place is surely an appropriate means of preventing subsidence of the surface; and ordinarily it is the only available means. Restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means, merely because it deprives the owner of the only use to which the property can then be profitably put. The liquor and the oleomargine cases settled that. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 668\n, 669 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 273; Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 682\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 992, 1257. See also Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, \n239 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 143, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 927; Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, \n248 U.S. 498\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 172. Nor is a restriction imposed through exercise of the police power inappropriate as a means, merely because the same end might be effected through exercise of the power of eminent domain, or otherwise at public expense. Every restriction upon the height of buildings might be secured through acquiring by eminent domain the right of each owner to build above the limiting height; but it is settled that the state need not resort to that power. Compare Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, \n216 U.S. 358\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 301; Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Omaha, \n235 U.S. 121\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 82. If by mining anthracite coal the owner would necessarily unloose poisonous gases, I suppose no one would doubt the power of the state to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may not the state, likewise, without paying compensation, prohibit one from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the community to \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 419]\n\u00a0\n like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying on the business would be a public nuisance.\n It is said that one fact for consideration in determining whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the resulting diminution in value, and that here the restriction destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If we are to consider the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the land. That is, with the value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole. The estate of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as extending ab orco usque ad coelum. But I suppose no one would contend that by selling his interest above 100 feet from the surface he could prevent the state from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a city. And why should a sale of underground rights bar the state's power? For aught that appears the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction may be negligible as compared with the value of the whole property, or even as compared with that part of it which is represented by the coal remaining in place and which may be extracted despite the statute. Ordinarily a police regulation, general in operation, will not be held void as to a particular property, although proof is offered that owing to conditions peculiar to it the restriction could not reasonably be applied. See Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 681\n, 684 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 992, 1257; Murphy v. California, \n225 \nU.S. 623, 629\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 697, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 153. But even if the particular facts are to govern, the statute should, in my opinion be upheld in this case. For the defendant has failed to adduce any evidence from which \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 420]\n\u00a0\n it appears that to restrict its mining operations was an unreasonable exercise of the police power. Compare Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 171, 177\n, 180 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 511; Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, \n248 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 172. Where the surface and the coal belong to the same person, self-interest would ordinarily prevent mining to such an extent as to cause a subsidence. It was, doubtless, for this reason that the Legislature, estimating the degrees of danger, deemed statutory restriction unnecessary for the public safety under such conditions.\n It is said that this is a case of a single dwelling house, that the restriction upon mining abolishes a valuable estate hitherto secured by a contract with the plaintiffs, and that the restriction upon mining cannot be justified as a protection of personal safety, since that could be provided for by notice. The propriety of deferring a good deal to tribunals on the spot has been repeatedly recognized. Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91, 106\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 567; Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, \n216 \nU.S. 358, 365\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 301; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 281. May we say that notice would afford adequate protection of the public safety where the Legislature and the highest court of the state, with greater knowledge of local conditions, have declared, in effect, that it would not? If the public safety is imperiled, surely neither grant, nor contract, can prevail against the exercise of the police power. Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. North Carolina, \n232 U.S. 548\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 364; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 U.S. 372\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 117, 9 A. L. R. 1420; St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, \n249 U.S. 269\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 274. The rule that the state's power to take appropriate measures to guard the safety of all who may be within its jurisdiction may not be bargained away was applied to compel carriers to establish grade crossings at their own expense, despite contracts to the contrary (Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 U.S. 57\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 513); \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 421]\n\u00a0\n and, likewise, to supersede, by an Employers' Liability Act, the provision of a charter exempting a railroad from liability for death of employees, since the civil liability was deemed a matter of public concern, and not a mere private right. Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Miller, \n221 U.S. 408\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 534. Compare Boyd v. Alabama, \n94 U.S. 645\n; Stone v. Mississippi, \n101 U.S. 814\n; Butchers' Union Co. v.

Nor can existing contracts between private individuals preclude exercise of the police power. 'One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction cannot remove them from the power of the state by making a contract about them.' Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 438\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 531; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 U.S. 342\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455. The fact that this suit is brought by a private person is, of course, immaterial. To protect the community through invoking the aid, as litigant, of interested private citizens is not a novelty in our law. That it may be done in Pennsylvania was decided by its Supreme Court in this case. And it is for a state to say how its public policy shall be enforced.\n This case involves only mining which causes subsidence of a dwelling house. But the Kohler Act contains provisions in addition to that quoted above; and as to these, also, an opinion is expressed. These provisions deal with mining under cities to such an extent as to cause subsidence of--\n\n\n (a)\n Any public building or any structure customarily used by the public as a place of resort, assemblage, or amusement, including, but not limited to, churches, schools, hospitals, theaters, hotels, and railroad stations.\n\n\n (b)\n Any street, road, bridge, or other public passageway, dedicated to public use or habitually used by the public. \n\n[260 U.S. 393, 422]\n\u00a0\n (c) Any track, roadbed, right of way, pipe, conduit, wire, or other facility, used in the service of the public by any municipal corporation or public service company as defined by the Public Service Law, section 1.\n A prohibition of mining which causes subsidence of such structures and facilities is obviously enacted for a public purpose; and it seems, likewise, clear that mere notice of intention to mine would not in this connection secure the public safety. Yet it is said that these provisions of the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems to rest upon the assumption that in order to justify such exercise of the police power there must be 'an average reciprocity of advantage' as between the owner of the property restricted and the rest of the community; and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage is an important consideration, and may even be an essential, where the state's power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the property of a neighborhood, as in drainage projects (Wurts v. Hoagland, \n114 U.S. 606\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1086; Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 U.S. 112\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 56); or upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions (Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., \n260 U.S. 22\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 9, 67 L. Ed. --, decided October 23, 1922). But where the police power is exercised, not to confer benefits upon property owners but to protect the public from detriment and danger, there is in my opinion, no room for considering reciprocity of advantage. There was no reciprocal advantage to the owner prohibited from using his oil tanks in \n248 U.S. 498\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 172; his brickyard, in \n239 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 143, Ann. Cas, 1917B, 927; his livery stable, in \n237 U.S. 171\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 511; his billiard hall, in \n225 U.S. 623\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 697, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 153; his oleomargarine factory, in \n127 U.S. 678\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 992, 1257; his brewery, in \n123 U.S. 623\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 273; unless it be the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the act to the coal operators. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPIERCE OIL CORP. v. PHOENIX REFINING CO.(1922)\nNo. 172\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Preston C. West, of Tulsa, Okl., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1913 the defendant in error the Phoenix Refining Company (herein designated the Phoenix Company), a corporation organized under the laws of Oklahoma, erected an oil refinery at Sand Springs, in that state. In the same year the plaintiff in error, the Pierce Oil Corporation (herein designated the Pierce Company), a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, erected a refinery at Sand Springs, and also constructed a pipe line, wholly within the state of Oklahoma, to the Cushing oil field, a distance of 33 miles.\n Beginning in 1915, the Pierce Company transported oil for the Phoenix Company through its pipe line from the \n\n[259 U.S. 125, 126]\n\u00a0\n Cushing field to its refinery, under annual written contracts, prescribing rates and conditions until in February, 1918, when it informed that company that it would not carry its oil on any terms after the 21st of the following March.\n Thereupon the complaint in this case was filed with the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, praying that the Pierce Company be declared to be a common carrier of oil and that it be ordered to transport oil for the Phoenix Company from the Cushing field to its refinery at a charge to be fixed. The Pierce Company, in its answer, averred: That it had constructed its pipe line to supply its own refinery only, and that it was not, and had never held itself out to be, a common carrier of oil; that it had carried oil for the Phoenix Company as a matter of accommodation only; and that to subject it to the duties and responsibilities of a common carrier would result in the taking of its property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n After an elaborate hearing, the Corporation Commission held: That the Pierce Company had carried oil for the Phoenix Company and for various others for several years at rates agreed upon; that its pipe line was the only available and practicable line by which the Phoenix Company could procure oil from the Cushing Field for its refinery; that the Pierce Company, in competition with others, purchased oil in the Cushing field, which it transported to its refinery at Sand Springs; and that it had a monopoly of the oil-carrying business between the Cushing field and Sand Springs. As a result, it was held that the Pierce Company was a common carrier of oil, as defined in the Oklahoma Laws, and it was ordered to carry such oil as the Phoenix Company was then producing in the Cushing field and such other oil as the Pierce Company might have available space or capacity to transport \n\n[259 U.S. 125, 127]\n\u00a0\n in its line, from the Cushing Field to Sand Springs. Because the evidence was not deemed sufficient no order was made as to rates.\n On appeal, the state Supreme Court found that there was substantial evidence to support the order of the Corporation Commission and affirmed it, but it also held that the Pierce Company, having qualified and entered Oklahoma to do business long after the state Constitution was adopted and after the statutes of the state, under which the order was made, were enacted, it would not be heard to contend that it was deprived of its property thereby without due process of law in the constitutional sense. This last conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the case here.\n The state of Oklahoma was admitted into the Union in 1907, with a constitution theretofore adopted by the people, which provided for a corporation commission, with large powers of regulation and supervision over oil pipe and other transportation companies doing business in the state (article 9,  15 to 35, inclusive), and in 1909 there were enacted various statutes, now collected in chapter 53, article 2, of the Revised Laws of Oklahoma 1910, applicable to oil pipe lines.\n These statutes declared that, except as authorized therein, no corporation (domestic or foreign) should have the right to engage in the business of transporting crude petroleum through pipe lines within the state 'for hire or otherwise' (section 4304), and that every corporation engaged in such business under the state laws should 'be deemed a common carrier thereof as at common law' (section 4309). It was also provided that before any corporation should be entitled to the provisions of the acts it must file with the State Corporation Commission an 'authorized acceptance of the provisions of this article and the Constitution of the state' and a plat showing the location and capacity of the company's pipe line. Section 4311. \n\n[259 U.S. 125, 128]\n\u00a0\n This Constitution and these laws had been in effect for five years when the Pierce Company, by applying for and obtaining the privilege of conducting its business operations within the state, elected to respect and obey them, and therefore when it engaged in the business of transporting crude petroleum through pipe lines in the state it must necessarily be subject to the duties and obligations of 'a common carrier as at common law,' and the order complained of required this only to a limited extent.\n When the large discretion which the state had to impose terms upon this foreign corporation as a condition of permitting it to engage in wholly intrastate business is considered (National Council U. A. M. v. State Council, \n203 \nU.S. 151, 163\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 46; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56, 66\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 232; Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 83\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 15) the contention that this order, of a tribunal to the jurisdiction of which the company voluntarily submitted itself, made after notice and upon full hearing, deprives it of its property without due process of law must be pronounced futile to the point almost of being frivolous. 'By accepting the privilege it voluntarily consented to be bound by the conditions' attached to it (\n216 \nU.S. 56, 66\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 232), and, while enjoying the benefits of that privilege, it will not be heard to complain that an order, plainly within the scope of statutes in effect when it entered the state, is unconstitutional. A claim so similar to the one we have here that the disposition of it should have been accepted as disposing of this case was dealt with by this court in the Pipe Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 548, 561\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 956, 958 (58 L. Ed. 1459) in a single sentence, saying:\n'So far as the statute contemplates future pipe lines and prescribes conditions under which they may be established, there can be no doubt that it is valid.'\n\n There is nothing in the nature of such a constitutional right as is here asserted to prevent its being waived or the right to claim it barred, as other rights may be, by deliberate \n\n[259 U.S. 125, 129]\n\u00a0\n election or by conduct inconsistent with the assertion of such a right. Pierce v. Somerset Railway Co., \n171 \nU.S. 641, 658\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 64; Wall et al. v. Parrot Silver & Copper Mining Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 609\n\n\n The prior order of the Commission, exempting the Pierce Company from the obligations of a common carrier, was made on an ex parte application and was expressly subject to revocation at any time, so that it was and is entirely idle to claim that it constituted any obstacle to the entry by the commission of the order complained of in this case.\n It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma must be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPINE HILL COAL CO. v. U S(1922)\nNo. 101\nArgued: January 20, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadephia, Pa., for appellant.[ Pine Hill Coal Co v. U S \n259 U.S. 191\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[259 U.S. 191, 194]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, like Morrisdale Coal Co. v. United States, \n259 U.S. 188\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 481, 66 L. Ed. --, is a claim based upon the action of the Fuel Administration under the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53,  25, 40 Stat. 276, 284 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 q), fixing prices for coal. The allegations and arguments however are different. The transactions of the claimant from and including September, 1917, through January, 1919, are set forth in detail. They embrace large sales at government prices and smaller sales at other than those prices. It is alleged that the prices fixed for the claimant's coal were unjust and unreasonable and did not afford just compensation, and that as a result of keeping to them, as the claimant did, the receipts were actually less than the cost of production. On these facts the petition sets up a contract of indemnity on the part of the United States arising out of the language to be quoted from section 25. It was dismissed on demurrer by the Court of Claims.\n The paragraph of section 25 that is relied upon follows paragraphs giving authority to the President personally or through the Federal Trade Commission to fix the price of coal and coke, to regulate the method of distribution among dealers and consumers during the war, and if a producer or dealer neglects to conform to such prices or regulations, etc., to take over the plant and business, paying a just compensation. The paragraph in question reads:\n'That if the prices so fixed, or if, in the case of the taking over or requisitioning of the mines or business of any such producer or dealer the compensation therefor as determined by the provisions of this Act be not satisfactory to the person or persons entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so \n\n[259 U.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n determined, and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum, will make up such amount as will be just compensation in the manner provided by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and section one hundred and forty-five of the Judicial Code.'\n\n The latter section of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1136) is the one that gives jurisdiction to the Court of Claims and the former that which gives a limited concurrent jurisdiction to the District Courts.\n It is obvious that the words as they stand cannot be applied to sales by producers to third persons; for it would be absurd to suppose that the United States undertook to pay not only such additional sum as might be awarded but also the last 25 per centum of the price as fixed, leaving the buyer to retain that amount. The claimant admits this, but insists that however read the pragraph cannot be followed without correction. It argues that the opening words, 'if the price so fixed,' necessarily apply to prices in general as fixed by the power just given in the section. Therefore, it says, there should be interpolated in the provision that the seller shall be paid 75 per centum the words 'the prices so fixed or'; and in like manner that the provision for recovery should read that he shall recover such sum as added to 'the said prices or' said 75 per centum will be just. It points out that while seeking to stimulate production in aid of the war the Government could not fix very high prices without arousing householders and manufacturers, or very low ones without endangering the supply and incurring the charge of confiscation. It is said that the natural way out of the difficulty was for the Government to guarantee a just return, and that by so doing it avoided doubts as to the constitutionality of the statute. There is offered a critical and refined scrutiny of the history of the amendment that introduced the claim. The argument is that the section that became section 25, when originally offered \n\n[259 U.S. 191, 196]\n\u00a0\n as an amendment, clearly provided for payment in all cases, that a modification was introduced for payment of only 75 per centum upon takings by the United States, but that it was not intended to change the general scope of the relief. Other makeweights are thrown in to which we think it unnecessary to advert.\n It is a delicate business to base speculations about the purposes or construction of a statute upon the vicissitudes of its passage. Here we have as against the arguments of the claimant the fundamental and necessarily governing consideration that rightly prevailed below. A liability in any case is not to be imposed upon a Government without clear words. But liability for a regulation, for the consequences of a law, on the part of the legislating power, is most unusual, and where, as here, the liability would mount to great sums, only the plainest language could warrant a Court in taking it to be imposed. The general words 'the prices so fixed' taken by themselves no doubt would include prices to private purchasers, but the specific provision as to paying 75 per centum prevails over them on the usual principles of construction and excludes a reference to any prices except those paid by the Government. It is said that those prices are provided for elsewhere, but the claimant's argument presses the consideration that the law had to be hastily passed, and unnecessary reduplication is far more easy to admit than an enormous charge upon the United States that can be fastened upon it only by inserting into a statute words that are not there.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPONZI v. FESSENDEN(1922)\nNo. 631\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 254, 255]\n\u00a0\n This case comes here for answer to the following question of law:\n'May a prisoner, with the consent of the Attorney General, while serving a sentence imposed by a district court of the United States, be lawfully taken on a writ of habeas corpus, directed to the master of the House of Correction, who, as federal agent under a mittimus issued out of said District Court, has custody of such prisoner, into a state court, in the custody of said master and there put to trial upon indictments there pending against him?'\n\n September 11, 1920, 22 indictments were returned against Charles Ponzi in the superior court for Suffolk county, Mass., charging him with certain larcenies.\n October 1, 1920, two indictments charging violation of section 215 of the federal Penal Code (Comp. St.  10385) were returned against him in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. November 30, 1920, he pleaded guilty to the first count of one of these, and was sentenced to imprisonment for five years in the House of Correction at Plymouth, Mass., and committed.\n April 21, 1921, the superior court issued a writ of habeas corpus, directing the master of the House of Correction, who, as federal agent, had custody of Ponzi by virtue of the mittimus issued by the District Court, to bring him before the superior court and to have him there from day to day thereafter for trial upon the pending indictments, but to hold the prisoner at all times in his custody as an agent of the United States, subject to the sentence imposed by the federal District Court. Blake, \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 256]\n\u00a0\n the master of the House of Correction, made a return that he held Ponzi pursuant to process of the United States, and prayed that the writ be dismissed.\n Thereafter the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, by direction of the United States Attorney General, stated in open court that the United States had no objection to the issuance of the writ, to the compliance with the writ by Blake, or to the production of Ponzi for trial in the superior court, and that the Attorney General had directed Blake to comply with the writ. Blake then produced the prisoner, who was arraigned on the state indictments and stood mute. A plea of not guilty was entered for him by the court.\n May 23, 1921, Ponzi filed in the District Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus directed against the justice of the superior court, and against Blake, alleging in substance that he was within the exclusive control of the United States, and that the state court had no jurisdiction to try him while thus in federal custody. His petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judges of which certify the question to this court on the foregoing facts. Section 239, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216).\n Mr. William H. Lewis, of Boston, Mass., for Ponzi.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 254, 259]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Weston Allen, of Boston, Mass., for Fessenden and others.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We live in the jurisdiction of two sovereignties, each having its own system of courts to declare and enforce its laws in common territory. It would be impossible for such courts to fulfill their respective functions without embarrassing conflict unless rules were adopted by them to avoid it. The people for whose benefit these two systems are maintained are deeply interested that each system shall be effective and unhindered in its vindication of its laws. The situation requires, therefore, not only definite rules fixing the powers of the courts in cases of jurisdiction over the same persons and things in actual litigation, but also a spirit of reciprocal comity and mutual assistance to promote due and orderly procedure. \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 260]\n\u00a0\n One accused of crime has a right to a full and fair trial according to the law of the government whose sovereignty he is alleged to have offended, but he has no more than that. He should not be permitted to use the machinery of one sovereignty to obstruct his trial in the courts of the other, unless the necessary operation of such machinery prevents his having a fair trial. He may not complain if one sovereignty waives its strict right to exclusive custody of him for vindication of its laws in order that the other may also subject him to conviction of crime against it. In re Andrews (D. C.) 236 Fed. 300; United States v. Marrin (D. C.) 227 Fed. 314. Such a waiver is a matter that addresses itself solely to the discretion of the sovereignty making it and of its representatives with power to grant it.\n One accused of crime, of course, cannot be in two places at the same time. He is entitled to be present at every stage of the trial of himself in each jurisdiction with full opportunity for defense. Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 341\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 582; Lewis v. United States, \n146 U.S. 370\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 136. If that is accorded him, he cannot complain. The fact that he may have committed two crimes gives him no immunity from prosecution of either.\n The chief rule which preserves our two systems of courts from actual conflict of jurisdiction is that the court which first takes the subject- matter of the litigation into its control, whether this be person or property, must be permitted to exhaust its remedy, to attain which it assumed control, before the other court shall attempt to take it for its purpose. The principle is stated by Mr. Justice Matthews in Covell v. Heyman, \n111 U.S. 176\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 355, as follows:\n'The forbearance which courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, administered under a single system, exercise towards each other, whereby conflicts are avoided, by avoiding interference with the process of each other, is a principle of comity, with perhaps no higher sanction than the utility \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 261]\n\u00a0\n which comes from concord; but between state courts and those of the United States it is something more. It is a principle of right and of law, and therefore, of necessity. It leaves nothing to discretion or mere convenience. These courts do not belong to the same system, so far as their jurisdiction is concurrent; and although they coexist in the same space, they are independent, and have no common superior. They exercise jurisdiction, it is true, within the same territory, but not in the same plane; and when one takes into its jurisdiction a specific thing, that res is as much withdrawn from the judicial power of the other, as if it had been carried physically into a different territorial sovereignty.'\n\n The Heyman Case concerned property, but the same principle applies to jurisdiction over persons as is shown by the great judgment of Chief Justice Taney in Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506. quoted from, and relied upon, in Covell v. Heyman.\n In the case at bar, the federal District Court first took custody of Ponzi. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to imprisonment and was detained under United States authority to suffer the punishment imposed. Until the end of his term and his discharge, no state court could assume control of his body without the consent of the United States. Under statutes permitting it, he might have been taken under the writ of habeas corpus to give evidence in a federal court, or to be tried there if in the same district, section 753, Rev. Stat. (section 1281, Comp. St.), or be removed by order of a federal court to be tried in another district, section 1014, Rev. Stat. (section 1674, Comp. St.), without violating the order of commitment made by the sentencing court. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75, 98; Ex parte Lamar (C. C. A.) 274 Fed. 160, 164. This is with the authority of the same sovereign which committed him.\n There is no express authority authorizing the transfer of a federal prisoner to a state court for such purposes. \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 262]\n\u00a0\n Yet we have no doubt that it exists and is to be exercised with the consent of the Attorney General. In that officer, the power and discretion to practice the comity in such matters between the federal and state courts is vested. The Attorney General is the head of the Department of Justice. Rev. Stat.  346 (Comp. St.  515). He is the hand of the president in taking care that the laws of the United States in protection of the interests of the United States in legal proceedings and in the prosecution of offenses be faithfully executed. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 U.S. 273\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 850; In re Neagle, \n135 U.S. 1\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 658; Kern River Co. v. United State, \n257 U.S. 147\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 60, decided November 21, 1921; Rev. Stat.  359, Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 816; Rev. Stat.  360, 361, 357, 364 (Comp. St.  533-536, 531, 539). By section 367, Rev. Stat. (section 542) the Attorney General is authorized to send the Solicitor General or any officer of the Department of Justice 'to any state or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in any suit pending in any of the courts of the United States, or in the courts of any state, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.'\n The prisons of the United States and the custody of prisoners under sentence are generally under the supervision and regulation of the Attorney General. Act March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 839 (Comp. St.  10552- 10560). He is to approve the expenses of the transportation of United States prisoners by the marshals under his supervision to the wardens of the prisons where they are to be confined, 26 Stat. 839. He makes contracts with managers of state prisons for the custody of United States prisoners. Rev. Stat.  5548 (Comp. St.  10549). He designates such prisons. Rev. Stat.,  5546, amended 19 Stat. 88, and 31 Stat. 1450 (Comp. St.  10547). Release of United States prisoners on parole, whether confined in federal prisons or in state prisons, is not made save with the approval of the Attorney General. Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 819 (Comp. St.  10535-10544). The Attorney General is authorized to change the place of imprisonment of United \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 263]\n\u00a0\n States prisoners confined in a state prison when he thinks it not sufficient to secure their custody, or on their application, because of unhealthy surroundings or improper treatment. Section 5546 as amended 19 Stat. 88, and 31 Stat. 1450. One important duty the Attorney General has to perform is the examination of all applications for pardon or commutation, and a report and recommendation to the President.\n This recital of the duties of the Attorney General leaves no doubt that one of the interests of the United States which he has authority and discretion to attend to through one of his subordinates in a state court under section 367, Rev. Stat., is that which relates to the safety and custody of United States prisoners in confinement under sentence of federal courts. In such matters he represents the United States, and may on its part practice the comity which the harmonious and effective operation of both systems of courts requires, provided it does not prevent enforcement of the sentence of the federal courts or endanger the prisoner. Logan v. United States, \n144 U.S. 263\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 617.\n Counsel for appellant relies on section 5539, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  10523), which directs that--\n When any criminal sentenced by a federal court is imprisoned in the jail or penitentiary of any state or territory 'such criminal shall in all respects be subject to the same discipline and treatment as convicts sentenced by the courts of the state or territory in which such jail or penitentiary is situated; and while so confined therein shall be exclusively under the control of the officers having charge of the same, under the laws of such state or territory.'\n This section it is said prevents the Attorney General or any other federal officer from ordering the superintendent of a state prison to produce a federal prisoner for trial or testimony. But it is clear that the section has no such effect. The section is only one of many showing the spirit of comity between \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 264]\n\u00a0\n the state and national governments in reference to the enforcement of the laws of each. To save expense and travel, the federal government has found it convenient with the consent of the respective states to use state prisons in which to confine many of its prisoners, and the Attorney General is the agent of the government to make the necessary contracts to carry this out. In order to render the duty thus assumed by the state governments as free from complication as possible, the actual authority over, and the discipline of, the federal prisoners while in the state prison are put in the state prison authorities. If the treatment or discipline is not satisfactory, the Attorney General can transfer them to another prison, but while they are there, they must be as amenable to the rules of the prison as are the state prisoners. But this does not have application to the procedure or the authority by which their custody may be permanently ended or temporarily suspended.\n The authorities, except when special statutes make an exception, are all agreed that the fact that a defendant in an indictment is in prison serving a sentence for another crime gives him no immunity from the second prosecution. One of the best-considered judgments on the subject is Rigor v. State, 101 Md. 465, 61 Atl. 631, 4 Ann. Cas. 719. The Supreme Court of Maryland said at page 471 of 101 Md. at page 634 of 61 Atl. (4 Ann. Cas. 719):\n'The penitentiary is not a place of sanctuary, and an incarcerated convict ought not to enjoy an immunity from trial merely because he is undergoing punishment on some earlier judgment of guilt.'\n\n Delay in the trial of accused persons greatly aids the guilty to escape because witnesses disappear, their memory becomes less accurate and time lessens the vigor of officials charged with the duty of prosecution. If a plea of guilty and imprisonment for one offence is to postpone trial on many others, it furnishes the criminal an opportunity to avoid the full expiation of his crimes. These \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 265]\n\u00a0\n considerations have led most courts to take the same view as that expressed in the case just cited. Other cases are State v. Wilson, 38 Conn. 126; Thomas v. People, 67 N. Y. 218, 225; Peri v. People, 65 Ill. 17; Commonwealth v. Ramunno, 219 Pa. 204, 68 Atl. 184, 14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 209, 123 Am. St. Rep. 653, 12 Ann. Cas. 818; Kennedy v. Howard, 74 Ind. 87; Singleton v. State, 71 Miss. 782, 16 South. 295, 42 Am. St. Rep. 488; Huffaker v. Commonwealth, 124 Ky. 115, 98 S. W. 331, 14 Ann. Cas. 487; Clifford v. Dryden, 31 Wash. 545, 72 Pac. 96; People v. Flynn, 7 Utah, 378, 26 Pac. 1114; Ex parte Ryan, 10 Nev. 261; State v. Keefe, 17 Wyo. 227, 252, 98 Pac. 122, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 896, 17 Ann. Cas. 161; Re Wetton, 1 Crompt. & J. 459; Regina v. Day, 3 F. & F. 526.\n It is objected that many of these cases relate to crimes committed in prison during service of a sentence. The Maryland case did not, nor did some of the others. But the difference suggested is not one in principle. If incarceration is a reason for not trying a prisoner, it applies whenever and wherever the crime is committed. The unsoundness of the view is merely more apparent when a prisoner murders his warden, than when he is brought before the court for a crime committed before his imprisonment. It is the reductio ad absurdum of the plea.\n Nor, if that be here important, is there any difficulty in respect to the execution of a second sentence. It can be made to commence when the first terminates. Kite v. Commonwealth, 11 Metc. (Mass.) 581, 585, an opinion by Chief Justice Shaw. Ex parte Ryan, 10 Nev. 261, 264; Thomas v. People, 67 N. Y. 218, 226.\n But it is argued that when the prisoner is produced in the superior court, he is still in the custody and jurisdiction of the United States, and that the state court cannot try one not within its jurisdiction. This is a refinement which if entertained would merely obstruct justice. The prisoner when produced in the superior court in compliance with its writ is personally present. He has full opportunity to make his defense exactly as if he were brought before the court by its own officer. State v. \n\n[258 U.S. 254, 266]\n\u00a0\n Wilson, 38 Conn. 126, 136. The trial court is given all the jurisdiction needed to try and hear him by the consent of the United States, which only insists on his being kept safely from escape or from danger under the eye and control of its officer. This arrangement of comity between the two governments works in no way to the prejudice of the prisoner or of either sovereignty.\n The question must be answered in the affirmative. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTSMOUTH HARBOR LAND & HOTEL CO. v. U S(1922)\nNo. 97\nArgued: November 15, 1922Decided: December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Chauncey Hackett, of Washington, D. C., for appellants. \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 328]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim in respect of land which, or an interest in which, is alleged to have been taken by the United States Government. Similar claims in respect of the same land based upon earlier acts of the Government have been made before and have been denied. Peabody v. United States, \n231 U.S. 530\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 159; Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States, \n250 U.S. 1\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 399. But it is urged that the cumulative effect of later acts added to those that have been held not enough to establish a taking leads to a different result. The land is on Gerrish Island, lying east of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbor, and borders on the ocean. Its main value is for use as a summer resort. Adjoining it to the north and west lies land of the United States upon which the Government has erected a fort, the guns of which have a range over the whole sea front of the claimants' property. In the first case it was decided that the mere erection of the fort and the fact that guns were fired over the claimants' land upon two occasions about two years and a half before the suit was brought, coupled with the apprehension that the firing would be repeated, but with no proof of intent to repeat it other than the facts stated, did not require the finding of an appropriation and a promise to pay by the United States. The second case was like the first except for 'some occasional subsequent acts of gun fire,' \n250 U.S. 2\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 399, and finding of the Court of Claims for the United States again was sustained.\n The present case was decided upon demurrer. The question therefore is not what inferences should be drawn from the facts that may be proved but whether the allegations \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 329]\n\u00a0\n it proved would require or at least warrant a different finding from those previously reached. There is no doubt that a serious loss has been inflicted upon the claimant, as the public has been frightened off the premises by the imminence of the guns; and while it is decided that that and the previously existing elements of actual harm do not create a cause of action, it was assumed in the first decision that--\n'If the Government had installed its battery, not simply as a means of defence in war, but with the purpose and effect of subordinating the strip of land between the battery and the sea to the right and privilege of the Government to fire projectiles directly across it for the purpose of practice or otherwise, whenever it saw fit, in time of peace, with the result of depriving the owner of its profitable use, the imposition of such a servitude would constitute an appropriation of property for which compensation should be made.' \n231 U.S. 538\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 160.\n\n That proposition we regard as clearly sound. The question is whether the petition before us presents the case supposed.\n It is alleged that after dismounting the old guns for the purpose of sending them to France during the late war, the United States has set up heavy coast defence guns with the intention of firing them over the claimants' land and without the intent or ability to fire them except over that land. It also, according to the petition, has established upon that land a fire control station and service, and in December, 1920, it again discharged all of the guns over and across the same land. The last fact, although occurring after this petition was filed, may be considered as bearing on the intent in establishing the fire control. If the United States, with the admitted intent to fire across the claimants' land at will should fire a single shot or put a fire control upon the land, it well might be that the taking of a right would be complete. But even when the intent thus to make use of the claimants' property is not admitted, while a single act may not be enough, a continuance of them in sufficient number and for a sufficient \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 330]\n\u00a0\n time may prove it. Every successive trespass adds to the force of the evidence. The establishment of a fire control is an indication of an abiding purpose. The fact that the evidence was not sufficient in 1905 does not show that it may not be sufficient in 1922. As we have said the intent and the overt acts are alleged as is also the conclusion that the United States has taken the land. That we take to be stated as a conclusion of fact and not of law, and as intended to allege the actual import of the foregoing acts. In our opinion the specific facts set forth would warrant a finding that a servitude has been imposed.\n It very well may be that the claimants will be unable to establish authority on the part of those who did the acts to bind the Government by taking the land, United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 U.S. 330\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 518. But as the allegation is that the United States did the acts in question, we are not prepared to pronounce it impossible upon demurrer. As the United States built the fort and put in the guns and the men, there is a little natural unwillingness to find lack of authority to do the acts even if the possible legal consequences were unforeseen. If the acts amounted to a taking, without assertion of an adverse right, a contract would be implied whether it was thought of or not. The repetition of those acts through many years and the establishment of the fire control may be found to show an abiding purpose to fire when the United States sees fit, even if not frequently, or they may be explained as still only occasional torts. That is for the Court of Claims when the evidence is heard.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs.\n I agree that, in time of peace, the United States has not the unlimited right to shoot from a battery over adjoining \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 331]\n\u00a0\n private property, even if no physical damage is done to it thereby; that a single shot so fired may, in connection with other conceivable facts, justify a court in finding that the government took, by eminent domain, the land or an easement therein; and that such taking, if made under circumstances which give rise to a contract implied in fact to pay compensation, will entitle the owner to sue in the Court of Claims. But the question here is not whether the facts set forth in the petition would alone, or in connection with other evidence, justify the court in finding such a taking and the implied contract. The case was heard on demurrer to the petition; the facts therein set forth must, therefore, be taken as the ultimate facts; and they must be treated as are the findings of fact made by the Court of Claims. These are treated like a special verdict and not as evidence from which inferences may be drawn. Rule 1 of this court, relating to appeals from the Court of Claims; Crocker v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 245; Brothers v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 426. Unless, therefore, the petition sets forth facts well pleaded, which, if found by the lower court would as matter of law entitle the claimants to a judgment, the lower court was, in my opinion, right in dismissing the petition.\n Appropriation by the United States of private property for public use, without instituting condemnation proceedings, does not entitle the owner to sue under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code,  24, par. 20 [Comp. St.  991 ]), unless the taking was made under such circumstances as to give rise to a contract express or implied in fact to pay compensation. Hill v. United States, \n149 U.S. 593\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 1011; Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 168-171, 15 Sup. Ct. 85; Belknap v. Schild, \n161 \nU.S. 10, 17\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 443; John Horstmann Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 138, 146\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 58. Hence this action must rest on a contract, express or implied in fact. Harley v. United States, \n198 U.S. 229\n; 25 Sup. Ct. 634; United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., \n234 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 840; William Cramp & Sons v. Curtis Turbine \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 332]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n246 \nU.S. 28, 40\n, 41 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 271. There is no suggestion of an express promise; and there is not to be found in the petition, or in the exhibits incorporated by reference, a single allegation, however general, of an implied contract. This omission would not be fatal, if the petition set forth the facts essential to the existence of the cause of action. But it does not. An appropriation of private property will not entitle the owner to recover if made by mistake or if made under a claim of right, although the claim is later shown to be unfounded. Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 130\n, 131 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 56. And, if the appropriation was made by an officer without authority, the claimant is likewise without this remedy against the government. United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 333\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 518. The essentials of a recovery are a taking on behalf of the United States, made by officials duly authorized, and under such conditions that a contract will be implied in fact. The petition fails to set out such facts. Indeed, the facts which are set out make it clear that what was done did not constitute a taking; that the officers of the Government in doing what they did, had no intention of subjecting it to any liability; that they were not authorized to take the land or an easement therein; and that they consistently denied that claimants were entitled to compensation. Implied contracts in fact do not arise from denials and contentions of parties, but from their common understanding whereby mutual intent to contract without formal words therefor is shown. Farnham v. United States, \n240 U.S. 537\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 427; E. W. Bliss Co. v. United States, \n253 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 191 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 455; Knapp v. United States, 46 Ct. Cl. 601, 643.\n The petition sets forth the proceedings in the two earlier cases, Peabody v. United States, \n231 U.S. 530\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 159, 58 L. Ed. Ed. 351; Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States, \n250 U.S. 1\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 399. Those judgments make res judicata, not only the fact that there was no appropriation prior to 1918, but \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 333]\n\u00a0\n also the facts specifically found in the second suit concerning the erection and maintenance of the battery, the policy and practice of the military authorities, and their intentions when the guns were discharged prior to that date. Among other things, as the petition states, the court found that the shots were fired for the purpose of testing certain modifications of the gun carriages made shortly prior thereto; that in so firing the guns the officers and agents of the United States especially desired, intended, and took precautions so to fire them, and believed they were so firing them, as to avoid firing any of them over any part of claimants' land; that such firing as was done over said land was due to a misunderstanding on the part of said officers and agents as to the boundaries of said land; that the fort was not constructed for the purpose of firing any of its guns over and across any of claimants' lands in time of peace, or of so firing them at all, except over the government's own premises occasionally for testing purposes; that the fort was never garrisoned; that no target or practice firing was ever done there; that until 1917, when its guns were dismounted for removal and use elsewhere, its batteries had been continuously kept in serviceable condition for defensive use by a small detail from Fort Constitution, across the harbor; and that it was the policy and practice of the military authorities not to maintain garrisons and train gun crews at all of its coast fortifications, but to maintain garrisons and do such training at fortifications where the facilities for training are best and where there was, or naturally would be, less objection and complaint by nearby residents on account of the noise and concussion. \n1\n The only later occurrences, \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 334]\n\u00a0\n material to the issue, which are set forth in this suit, in the petition as amended, are the reinstallation of the guns at the battery after the Armistice, the erection of a fire control station on claimants' land in connection therewith, and firing the guns on December 8, 1920\n\n\n This suit was begun in February, 1920. The original petition set forth the facts found in the earlier cases, and\n___ Between that time and 1911 no gun was fired from the fort. This battery is located within 200 feet of a corner of claimants' land. No part of the fort encroaches upon it; but the guns there installed had a range of fire over all its sea front, and whether the guns then installed could have been fired for practice or other necessary purpose in time of peace without shooting over claimants' land depends upon a question of law concerning ownership of a narrow strip of land over which the guns had a range of fire-a question as to which the parties were, and so far as appears are still, in dispute. It was not so far as then appeared, the intention of the government to fire in time of peace any gun already installed, or which might thereafter be installed, over and across the claimants' land, so as to deprive them of the use of the same or to injure them, except as such intention can be drawn from the fact that the guns then installed were so fixed as to make it possible so to do and the fact that they had been fired as stated. On these facts found by the Court of Claims (46 Ct. Cl. 39) that court and this held that there was no basis for the claim that the government had appropriated the land and impliedly agreed to pay for it. Peabody v. United States, \n231 U.S. 530\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 159. \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 335]\n\u00a0\n substantially nothing more, except the intention to reinstall the guns. It was devoted largely to pointing out errors in the earlier findings, for which it sought relief through the equity powers of the court. The only new fact then alleged, which may be deemed material, was 'establishing [on claimants' land] a fire control station and service for use of the fort.' The reinstallation of guns, and the firing in December, 1920, were first set up by an amendment filed in 1921. And it is by this reinstallation after the commencement of this suit, that the United States is alleged to have established the fort as a part of the permanent coast defense. \n2\n If there was no taking until the guns were installed and the shots fired in December, 1920, then there was no cause of action when this suit was brought, and the demurrer was properly sustained on that ground. See Court of Marion County v. United States, 53 Ct. Cl. 120, 150. And there is this further obstacle to the maintenance of the suit. We take judicial notice of the fact that on December 8, 1920, the United States was still at war with Germany and Austria-Hungry. Joint Resolution of March 3, 1921, c. 136, 41 Stat. 1359. That the government has in time of war the right to shoot over private land was assumed in Peabody \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 336]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, supra, and is not disputed. See, also, Peabody v. United States, 43 Ct. Cl. 5, 18. The Armistice, signed November 11, 1918, left the United States possessed in December, 1920, of the same power to fire over claimants' land as if war had then been flagrant. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 158-160, 40 Sup. Ct. 106. Reinstallation of the guns and testing them by firing was an appropriate precautionary measure, in view of a possible renewal of the conflict. Thus the only overt acts upon claimants' land which are alleged to have occurred after the date of the findings in the earlier cases, and which are relied upon as establishing a taking after entry of the judgment in \n250 U.S. 1\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 399, appear to have been acts done in the exercise of a right already possessed without a taking.\n It is said that the petition alleges, in general terms, a taking and intention to take by the United States; that this allegation alone, although general, is an allegation of all the facts necessary to give a cause of action; and that the specification in detail of the facts relied upon may be treated as surplusage. To this contention there are several answers. The practice of the Court of Claims, while liberal, does not allow a general statement of claim in analogy to the common counts. It requires a plain concise statement of the facts relied upon. See rule 15, Court of Claims. The petition may not be so general as to leave the defendant in doubt as to what must be met. Schierling v. United States, 23 Ct. Cl. 361; Atlantic Works v. United States, 46 Ct. Cl. 57, 61; New Jersey Foundry & Machine Co. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cl. 235; United States v. Stratton, 88 Fed. 54, 59, 31 C. C. A. 384. If the suit had rested upon a statute which provides that the owner of property appropriated shall receive compensation, a fairly general statement that the property had been taken might be sufficient; for, in such a case, the obligation to pay would follow as a conclusion of law. But here there \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 337]\n\u00a0\n is no such statute. The mere fact of appropriation would not raise a promise implied in law; hence claimants were obliged to set forth additional facts to show that the government intended to pay the claimants compensation. Moreover, the general allegation of taking was not left to stand alone. Claimants set forth, in great detail, the facts upon which they rely as constituting a legal taking. They have done it in such a way that the allegation of taking reads now, not as an allegation of fact, but as a statement by the pleader of a conclusion of law, and consequently is not admitted by the demurrer. Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, \n248 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 172. And for a further reason the facts set forth in detail may not be disregarded as surplusage. They negative the existence of a cause of action. Randall v. Howard, 2 Black, 585; McClure v. Township of Oxford, \n94 U.S. 429\n; Speidel v. Henrici, \n120 U.S. 377\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 610. The facts stated show, as indicated above, not only an absence of taking and of intention to take the claimants' property, but also an absence of authority to do so in those who did the acts relied upon.\n The petition alleges in terms authority in the Secretary of War to take the land. But in setting forth the facts relied upon the pleader has disclosed the absence of authority from the Secretary of War to the officers by whom the taking, if any, must have been made. Claimants seek in their suit to recover $820,000. They assert that the land is worth $700, 000. For the 15 years preceding the commencement of this suit, there had been active litigation, in which claimants had strenuously asserted that there was a taking, and the United States had throughout denied that it had taken, or intended to take, any property of claimants. Unless the Secretary of War conferred upon his subordinates, who made this alleged taking, authority to take this land or an easement therein, the goverment can, in no event, be made liable. United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 338]\n\u00a0\n \n253 \nU.S. 330, 333\n, 334 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 518. See Ball Engineering Co. v. J. G. White & Co., \n250 U.S. 46\n, 54-57, 39 Sup. Ct. 393. If the present case had proceeded to a trial on the facts, claimans could not have proved authority in the subordinate officers to acquire this land or an interest therein, by showing merely that they were authorized to reinstall the guns and to test them after installation. That is exactly what they had done before, and which the courts found did not constitute a taking. An authority to take land by purchase or by eminent domain is not conferred by the Secretary of War merely because he has authorized, directly or indirectly, certain discharges of guns for testing or other purposes. We must take judicial notice that to acquire land for fortifications is not, and was not, within the powers ordinarily conferred upon the Ordnance or upon the Artillery. We know that by Act of July 2, 1917, c. 35, 40 Stat. 241 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6911a), provision was made for speedy acquisition by the Secretary of War, by means of condemnation or purchase, of any land, temporary use thereof, or interest therein, needed for the site, location, construction, or prosecution of works for fortification or coast defenses; that, upon filing a petition for condemnation, the immediate possession thereof to the extent of the interest to be acquired could be obtained; and that by passage of this act the occasions for taking interests in land without first instituting condemnation proceedings had been largely removed. We know that by Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3914, 34 Stat. 764 (Comp. St.  6763) a contract involving payment of money may not be made in excess of appropriations. 30 Op. Attys. Gen. 147, 149. We know that Act of March 3, 1919, c. 99,  6, 40 Stat. 1305, 1309 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6702a), required that estimates of appropriation for fortifications and other defense works for the year beginning July 1, 1920, be submitted to Congress in the book of estimates. And we may take judicial notice of the fact that in submitting estimates of the amount needed for the year beginning \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 339]\n\u00a0\n July 1, 1920, 'for procurement or reclamation of land, or rights pertaining thereto, needed for site, location, construction, or prosecution of work for fortifications and coast defenses,' the Secretary of War asked for only $15,000 for the whole country for all these purposes, and that no part of that amount was allocated in the estimates to the 'purchase of land and interest in land.' Estimates of Appropriations, 66th Congress, 2d Session, Doc. 411, pp, 531, 532. The facts alleged, and of which we take judicial notice, show not only an absence of intention to take, but the absence of power and authority to take.\n The principle on which, under certain conditions, compensation may be recovered in the Court of Claims for private property appropriated for public purposes without condemnation proceedings, leaves unimpaired the long-established rules that the United States is not liable for its torts, nor for unauthorized acts of its officers and agents, although performed in the ordinary course of their business and for the benefit of the United States. The Tucker Act merely gives a remedy where the essential elements of contractual liability exist. It does not give a right of action against the United States in those cases where, if the transaction were between private parties, recovery could be had upon a contract implied in law, as in case of unjust enrichment (Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403), or when a plaintiff waives a tort and sues in contract (Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727; Hooe v. United States, \n218 U.S. 322\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 85). The fact alleged in the petition that at some time in 1919 the War Department offered to purchase part of this land for the fire control station-perhaps only a few square feet, or a rood, our of a 200-acre tract-when considered in connection with the other facts stated, serves not to prove, but to negative, authorization to make the taking asserted in this suit. That the offer was not accepted, \n\n[260 U.S. 327, 340]\n\u00a0\n and that the government did not institute condemnation proceedings, may tend to show that officers of the United States committed a tort on its behalf; but, if a tort was committed, the remedy lies with Congress, not with the courts. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The facts concerning the establishment and earlier use of the battery found in the first suit, were:\n By Act of February 21, 1873, c. 175, 17 Stat. 468, 469, Congress appropriated $50,000 for batteries in Portsmouth Harbor on Gerrish Island and Jerry Point, and by Act of February 10, 1875, c. 39, 18 Stat. 313, added to the appropriation for the Gerrish Island battery, $20,000. Under the authority thus conferred a tract of 70 acres abutting claimants' land was purchased in 1873, and construction was begun. After $50,000 had been expended in substantially completing the breast-high walls of the fortification, the work was suspended for lack of appropriations in 1876, and it was not resumed until funds were allotted out of the general appropriation made by the Act of May 7, 1898, c. 248, 30 Stat. 400, for fortifications and like purposes. Then, on the site of the old, uncompleted battery, there was constructed the battery now known as Ft. Foster, and in December, 1901, it was transferred to the Artillery. In June, 1902, the government fired two of the guns, and in September, 1902 another, for the purpose of testing guns and carriages off the coast, and in so doing it fired across complainants' land. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The amendment alleges:\n'And in so doing the United States have established the said fort and battery with the said guns as a part of the permanent establishment of the coast defense fortifications maintained by [it] ... without intending to fire, or being able to fire, the said guns to sea except over and across the said land. And the United States have used the said land of the said claimants for the establishment of a fire control station and service for the use of said fort. The United States have, since setting up the said guns as aforesaid, at frequent intervals in the use of said fort, raised the said guns and pointed them as aforesaid, over and across the said land, and have further, in the use of the said fort discharged all of the said guns as aforesaid, on or about the 8th day of December, 1920, over and across the said land.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRUDENTIAL INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. CHEEK(1922)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Holliday and Thomas W. White, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frederick H. Bacon, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Robert T. Cheek sued the Prudential Insurance Company of America in the circuit court of St. Louis to recover damages upon a cause of action set forth in two counts: First, that the company being a New Jersey corporation conducting a life insurance besiness in Missouri under license of the insurance department of that state, and plaintiff having been for more than 10 years continuously employed in its service, and having resigned said employment and left the company's service, plaintiff demanded of defendant's superintendent a letter setting forth the nature and character of the services rendered by him to said corporation and the duration thereof, and truly stating for what cause plaintiff had quit said service; that defendant, acting through its superintendent, without just cause refused to give to plaintiff such a letter, as provided by statute, and because of this plaintiff had been unable to secure employment and had suffered substantial damages. The second count was based upon an alleged unlawful agreement between defendant and two other companies, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, said companies having a monopoly of the industrial life insurance business in St. Louis, to the effect that \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n neither would, for a period of two years after his leaving the employ of either company, employ any man who for any reason had left the service of or had been discharged by either of the other companies, by which means plaintiff had been rendered unable to secure employment and had sustained substantial damages.\n The first count was based upon section 3020, Missouri Revised Statutes of 1909, which reads as follows:\n'Whenever any employe of any corporation doing business in this state shall be discharged or voluntarily quit the service of such corporation, it shall be the duty of the superintendent or manager of said corporation, upon the request of such employe (if such employe shall have been in the service of said corporation for a period of at least ninety days), to issue to such employe a letter, duly signed by such superintendent or manager, setting forth the nature and character of service rendered by such employe to such corporation and the duration thereof and truly stating for what cause, if any, such employe has quit such service; and if any such superintendent or manager shall fail or refuse to issue such letter to such employe when so requested by such employe, such superintendent or manager shall be deemed suilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.'\n\n A general demurrer interposed to each count was sustained by the trial court, and, plaintiff declining to plead further, judgment was rendered for defendant, from which plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of the state. That court, construing section 3020, held that it imposed a duty, not upon the superintendent or manager personally, but upon the corporation, acting through its superintendent or other proper officer, to issue the letter; that, the statute having imposed his duty for the public benefit \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n and also for the benefit of the employees of corporations, the public remedy by fine or other penalty was not exclusive, and the plaintiff as a party injured was entitled to recover his damages; overruled various constitutional objections raised by defendant to the validity of section 3020, among others that it deprived the corporation of liberty of contract without due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; held that the agreement or combination alleged in the second count gave the corporations a monopoly in their business, contrary to the law and public policy of the state, and, if it prevented plaintiff from obtaining employment, entitled him to recover his damages caused thereby; sustained both counts on all points; reversed the judgment; and remanded the cause for trial. Cheek v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 192 S. W. 387.\n Defendant thereupon answered the petition, reiterating in its plea to the first count the constitutional objections to section 3020, and in its plea to the second count averring that to permit a recovery against it by reason of the alleged agreement between the companies would deprive defendant of its property and its right to contract without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n On the issues so made up, the case went to trial and resulted in a verdict in favor of plaintiff upon both counts. Defendant having reserved its constitutional points, appealed from the resulting judgment to the Supreme Court, which, however, refused to take jurisdiction on the ground that all constitutional questions had been decided on the former appeal, and that the verdict, being for only $1,500, was less than the jurisdictional amount required by statute, and hence transferred the cause to the St. Louis Court of Appeals for final disposition. Cheek v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 209 S. W. 928. Defendant, treating this decision of the Supreme Court as a final judgment reviewable by writ of error from this court, sued out such a writ, and upon the ground that the judgment \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n was not final under the state law the cause was dismissed March 8, 1920, \n252 U.S. 567\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 343. Thereafter it was submitted to the St. Louis Court of Appeals, whih in conformity to the former opinion of the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment (Cheek v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 223 S. W. Rep. 754), overruled a motion for rehearing, and refused an application for certification of the case to the Supreme Court. A writ of error from this court to the St. Louis Court of Appeals followed, under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214).\n A motion to dismiss the latter writ, based upon the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeals, is not that of the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had, because the first decision of the Supreme Court rendered the constitutional questions res adjudicata, and that under the state Constitution the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to pass upon questions of that character, manifestly must be denied, and the case considered on its merits.\n The argument in support of the contention that the Service Letter Act is repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in brief, is that at common law an employer is under no obligation to give a testimonial of character or clearance card to his employee; that no man is compelled to enter into business relations with another, unless he desires to do so, and upon the dissolution of such relations no man can be compelled to divulge to the public his reasons for such dissolution; that it is a part of every man's civil rights that he be at liberty to refuse business relations with any other person, whether the refusal rests upon reason, or is the result of whim, caprice, or malice, and with his reasons neither the public nor third persons have any legal concern; and that in the absence of a contract either employer or employee may sever the relation existing between them for any reason, or without reason, and may not be compelled to divulge \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 535]\n\u00a0\n the reason without material interference with his fundamental rights. Assuming the rules of the common law to be as stated, it is obvious that to say they have an unqualified and universal application, unalterable by statute, begs the question at the outset.\n Section 3020 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, now a part of the general corporation laws of the state, was derived from an act of April 14, 1905 (Mo. Laws 1905, p. 178), entitled:\n'An act for the protection of laboring men by requiring employing corporations to give letter showing service of employe quitting service of such corporation, and providing penalty for violation of this act.'\n\n In giving its genesis the Supreme Court declared (Cheek v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 192 S. W. 389):\n'Prior to the enactment of this statute a custom had grown up in this state, among railroad and other corporations, not to employ any applicant for a position until he gave the name of his last employer, and upon receiving the name, it would write to said former employer, making inquiry as to the cause of the applicant's discharge, if discharged, or his cause for leaving the service of such former company. If the information furnished was not satisfactory, the applicant was refused employment. This custom became so sidespread and affected such vast numbers of laboring people it became a public evil, and worked great injustice and oppression upon large numbers of persons who earned their bread by the sweat of their faces. The statute quoted was enacted for the purpose of regulating that custom, not to destroy it (for it contained some good and useful elements, enabling the corporations of the state to ascertain the degree of the intelligence as well as the honesty, capacity, and efficiency of those whom they wished to employ, for whose conduct they are responsible to the public and their fellow employees), and thereby remedy the evil which flowed therefrom.'\n\n And again (192 S. W. 392):\n'The statute under consideration imposes no unjust burden or expense upon the respondent or other \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n corporations doing business in this state. It was designed to protect the public interests as well as the wage-earner, against an injurious custom given birth to and fostered by said corporations. That a foreign corporation has no inherent right to exist or to do business in this state is no longer an open question. It derives those rights from the state, impressed with such conditions and burdens as the state may deem proper to impose, and when such a corporation comes into this state to do business, it must conform to the laws of this state, and will not be heard to complain of the unconstitutionality of our police regulations.'\n\n That freedom in the making of contracts of personal employment, by which labor and other services are exchanged for money or other forms of property, is an elementary part of the rights of personal liberty and private property, not to be struck down directly or arbitrarily interfered with, consistently with the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, we are not disposed to question. This court has affirmed the principle in recent cases. Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 174\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764; Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960.\n But the right to conduct business in the form of a corporation, and as such to enter into relations of employment with individuals, is not a natural or fundamental right. It is a creature of the law; and a state, in authorizing its own corporations or those of other states to carry on business and employ men within its borders, may qualify the privilege by imposing such conditions and duties as reasonably may be deemed expedient, in order that the corporation's activities may not operate to the detriment of the rights of others with whom it may come in contact.\n The statute in question is of this character; in it the Legislature has recognized that, by reason of the systematic methods of engaging and dismissing employees that \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n employing corporations themselves established, 'letters of dismissal,' or something of the kind, are not only customary, but a matter of necessity, to those seeking employment, as well as to the corporations themselves, perhaps more necessary to those seeking employment, because of their want of organization, than to the corporations.\n Can it be called an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation that requires an employing corporation to furnish to an employee, who after having served it for a time is discharged or voluntarily quits the service, a letter, signed by the superintendent or manager, setting forth the nature, character, and duration of the service rendered, and for what cause, if any, he left the service? It does not prevent the corporation from employing whom it pleases on any terms that may be agreed upon. So far as construed and applied in this case, it does not debar a corporation from dismissing an employee without cause, if such would be its right otherwise, nor from stating that he is dismissed without cause if such be the fact. It does not require that it give a commendatory letter. There is nothing to interfere, even indirectly, with the liberty of the corporation in dealing with its employee, beyond giving him, instead of what formerly was called a 'reference' or 'character,' a brief statement of his service with the company according to the truth, a word of introduction, to be his credentials, where otherwise the opportunity of future employment easily might be barred or impeded.\n That statutes having the same general purpose, though sometimes less moderate provisions, have been adopted in other states, attests of widespread belief in the necessity for such legislation.

Texas: \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 538]\n\u00a0\n Rev. Civil Stat. 1911, art. 594. Fifty years ago, in an act for the protection of seamen, Congress established and still maintains a provision that, upon the discharge of any seaman or upon payment of his wages, the master shall sign and give him a certificate of discharge, specifying the period of his service and the time and place of discharge, in a prescribed form, which calls for numerous identifying particulars, and permits a statement of the seaman's character and capacity. Act June 7, 1872, c. 322 ,  24, 17 Stat. 262, 267, 280; Rev. Stat. U. S.  4551 (Comp. St.  8340); 17 Stat. table B, p. 896.\n Plaintiff in error places much reliance upon expressions of opinion contained in a number of cases in the state courts, chiefly the following:\n Wallace v. Georgia, etc., Ry. Co., 94 Ga. 732, 22 S. E. 579. Here the Supreme Court of Georgia held that 'An act to require certain corporations to give to their discharged employees or agents the causes of their removal or discharge, when discharged or removed,' was contrary to the fundamental law of the state, on the ground that the public, whether as a multitude or a sovereignty, had no interest to be protected or promoted by a correspondence between discharged agents or employees and their late employers, designed, not for public, but for private information as to the reasons for discharges and that the statute was violative of the general private right of silence enjoyed in that state by all persons, natural or artificial, from time immemorial; liberty of speech and of writing being secured by the state Constitution, 'and incident thereto is the correlative liberty of silence, not less important.' The case obviously is not in point, since the Constitution of the United States imposes upon the states no obligation to confer upon those within their jurisdiction either the right of free speech or the right of silence.\n Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Brown, 80 Kan. 312, 102 Pac. 459, 23 L. R. A. (N. S.) 247, 133 Am. St. Rep. 213, held that a service letter statute of that state (Laws 1897, c. 144; Gen. Stat. 1901,  2422) was repugnant \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 539]\n\u00a0\n to section 11 of the Bill of Rights of the state, and 'an interference with the personal liberty graranteed to every citizen by the state and federal Constitutions.' The section of the bill of rights relied on was:\n'All persons may freely speak, write or publish their sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right.'\n\n This of course has no present significance. The reference to the federal Constitution was to section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; but the opinion does not indicate what bearing, if any, the due process of law clause was deemed to have. It appears rather that the right to discharge a servant for any reason, or for no reason, was thought to be one of the 'privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.' But, as this court more than once has pointed out, the privileges or immunities of citizens, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by state laws, are not those fundamental privileges and immunities inherent in state citizenship, but only those which owe their existence to the federal government, its national character, its Constitution, or its laws. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 72-74, 77-80; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 570; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 538\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 2. The reasoning of the Supreme Court of Kansas in this case is not convincing. The case was cited in Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960, not, however, in approval of its views upon the question now presented, but in order to show that the court had recognized that under the law of the state an employer might discharge his employee for any reason or without reason, and could not be compelled to give a reason where one did not exist; a view inconsistent, as we thought, with the same court's decision in the Coppage Case, then under review.\n The Legislature of Texas placed upon the statute book an act aimed at 'blacklisting' (Rev. Civil Stats. 1911, art. 594), which required that any corporation or receiver of the same, doing business in the state, having discharged \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 540]\n\u00a0\n an employee, should furnish him with a true statement of the cause of discharge, or a statement in writing that he had left the service voluntarily, besides other provisions much more onerous and which were especially criticized by the Supreme Court of the state, when it came to pass upon the constitutionality of the act.\n This statute, having twice been sustained as constitutional by the Court of Civil Appeals (St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Hixon \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 1910]\n\u00a0\n 126 S. W. 338, reversed by the Supreme Court, without passing upon the constitutional question, 104 Tex. 267, 270, 137 S. W. 343; St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Griffin \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 1913]\n\u00a0\n 154 S. W. 583), was passed upon by the Supreme Court in the latter case, and the act declared invalid. 106 Tex. 477, 171 S. W. 703, L. R. A. 1917B, 1108 (1914). That court declared that the liberty of contract was a natural right of the citizen, beyond the power of the government to take from him; in effect that the same liberty pertained to a corporation employer as to an individual employee; by implication that the statutory provision requiring such an employer to furnish its discharged employee with a statement of the cause of his discharge amounted to a destruction of the corporation's right to discharge the employee without cause and 'a violation of the constitutional right of equal protection of the law as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment'; that to confer upon an employee the right to recover damages of the corporation upon his dismissal should fail to give him a statement of the true cause of his discharge was 'a violation of the natural right to speak or be silent, or the liberty of contract secured by the constitution of this State and of the United States'; besides much in criticism of certain so-called inquisitorial provisions not found or paralleled in the Missouri statute that we are considering.\n Opinion of the Justices, 220 Mass. 627, 108 N. E. 807, L. R. A. 1917B, 1119, is an advisory opinion to the Senate of the commonwealth upon a proposed \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 541]\n\u00a0\n measure of legislation, to the effect, that no employee of a railroad corporation shall be disciplined or discharged 'in consequence of information' affecting 'the employee's conduct until such employee shall have been given an opportunity to make a statement in the presence of the person or persons furnishing the information,' and that the corporation be prohibited from discharging an employee without compliance with the proposed provisions under a heavy penalty. The opinion appears to have been based upon the ground, among others, that the proposed bill would require the corporation to produce at a hearing the person from whom it had derived its information even though such person might be a stranger to the railroad and declined for any reason or was unable to confront the employee. After quoting views expressed by this court in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427, Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45, 53\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 539, 3 Ann. Cas. 1133, Adair v. United States, \n208 U.S. 161\n, 174-175, 28 Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764, Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960, the opinion proceeded:\n'It seems to us impossible to say that the right of an employer to discharge an employee because of information affecting his conduct in respect of efficiency, honesty, capacity, or in any other particular touching his general usefulness, without first providing a hearing, stands on a different footing or is less under the shield of the Constitution than the right held to be secured in the Adair and Coppage Cases. ... In the absence of a contract, conspiracy or other unlawful act, the right of the individual employee to leave the service of a railroad without cause, or for any cause, is absolute. The railroad has the correlative right under like circumstances to discharge an employee for any cause or without cause. It is an unreasonable interference with this liberty of contract to require a statement by the employer of the motive for his action in desiring to discharge an employee, as this statute in substance does, and to require him also as a prerequisite to the exercise of his right, to enable the employee to make \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 542]\n\u00a0\n a statement in the presence of some one else-a thing which may be beyond the power of the employer. His freedom of contract would be impaired to an unwarrantable degree by the enactment of the proposed statute. ...'\n\n For reasons thus outlined five of the seven justices expressed the view that the proposed bill would be invalid as an unreasonable interference with the liberty of contract, and for other reasons not necessary to be mentioned. It will be noted that the proposed bill had a direct effect upon the relations between employer and employee, pending the employment, which the Missouri statute has not.\n We have examined the opinions referred to with the care called for by the importance of the case before us, and are bound to say that beyond occasional manifestations of a disinclination to concede validity to acts of legislation having the general character of Service Letter Laws, we have found nothing of material weight; no well-considered judgment, much less a formidable body of opinion, worthy to be regarded as supporting the view that a statute which, like the Missouri statute, merely requires employing corporations to furnish a dismissed employee with a certificate setting forth the nature and character of the service rendered, its duration, and for what cause, if any, the employee has left such service, amounts to an interference with freedom of contract so serious and arbitrary as properly to be regarded a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The cases cited from Georgia, from Kansas, and from Texas place material dependence upon provisions of the several state Constitutions guaranteeing freedom of speech, from which is deduced as by contrast a right of privacy called the 'liberty of silence'; and it seems to be thought that the relations between a corporation and its employees and former employees are a matter of wholly private concern. \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 543]\n\u00a0\n But, as we have stated, neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution of the United States imposes upon the states any restrictions about 'freedom of speech' or the 'liberty of silence'; nor, we may add, does it confer any right of privacy upon either persons or corporations.\n Previous decisions of this court are far from furnishing support for the contentions of plaintiff in error. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427, related to legislation of a wholly different character and contains nothing that bears upon this. Lochner v. New York, \n198 U.S. 45\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 539, 3 Ann. Cas. 1133, dealt with a statute concededly valid, if enacted in the interest of the public health, and held it void on the ground that in truth it was not, within the fair meaning of the term, a health law, but was an illegal interference with the right of individuals to make contracts upon such terms as they might deem best. Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 174\n, 175 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960, dealt with statutes-the former with an act of Congress making it criminal for a common carrier in interstate commerce to discharge an employee because of his membership in a labor organization; the latter with a state law making it criminal to prescribe as a condition upon which one might secure or retain employment that the employee should agree not to become or remain a member of any labor organization while so employed and this in the absence of contract between the parties, coercion on the part of the employer, or incapacity or disability on the part of the employee. In accord with an almost unbroken current of authority in the state courts holding statutes of that character to be invalid, this court came to a like conclusion. In the latter case there was a direct interference with freedom in the making of contracts of employment not asserted to have relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare beyond a purpose to favor the employee at the expense of the employer, and \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 544]\n\u00a0\n to build up the labor organizations, which we held was not properly an exercise of the police power. This statute, in making it criminal, as it did upon the construction adopted and applied, for an employer to prescribe as a condition of employing or retaining a man competent and willing to assent to the condition, that he should agree not to become or remain a member of a labor organization while so employed, the employee being subject to no incapacity or disability, but, on the contrary, free to exercise a voluntary choice, in effect made it a compulsory and unwelcome term of the employment that the employee must be left free to join a labor union, membership in which reasonably might be expected to interfere materially with the member's fidelity to his employer.\n As has been shown, the Missouri statute interposes no obstacle or interference as to either the making or the termination of contracts of employment, and prescribes neither terms nor conditions. The Supreme Court of the State, having ample knowledge of the conditions which gave rise to the particular legislation, declares with an authority not to be denied that it was required in order to protect the laboring man from conditions that had arisen out of customs respecting employment and discharge of employees introduced by the corporations themselves. It sustains the act as an exercise of the police power, but in truth it requires no extraordinary aid, being but a regulation of corporations calling for on application of the familiar precept, 'Sic utere tuo,' etc., in a matter of general public concern. Except by consent of the state the corporation, foreign or domestic, would have no right to employ laborers within its borders. A foreign corporation does not, as intimated by the court below, waive any constitutional objection by coming in. See Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 U.S. 529\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 188, decided February 27, 1922. But it has no valid objection to such reasonable regulations as may be prescribed for domestic corporations similarly \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 545]\n\u00a0\n circumstanced. The state with good reason might regulate the terms and conditions of employment, including the methods of accepting and dismissing employees, so as to prevent the corporations from producing undue detriment to the individuals concerned, either while employed or when afterwards they are called upon to seek other employment. In our opinion, no danger of 'blacklisting' is necessary to justify legislation requiring that corporations dismissing employees furnish them with a certificate stating the period of the service, its nature and character, and the cause, if any, that led to its termination. It might be recognized that in the highly organized conditions of industry now prevailing-largely developed by the corporations themselves, and to which their success is greatly due-it is not to be expected that unemployed men can obtain responsible employment without some credentials proceeding from a former employer. The Legislature might believe it to be well understood that a period of employment by a corporation-notably so in the case of insurance companies-is a test of capacity, fidelity, and the other qualities that go to make efficiency; that such a corporation may operate as a training school, fitting employees not only for its own but for other lines of employment. Such a training may almost inevitably produce effects upon the individuals in forming both character and reputation-effects that cannot be brought to an end at the will of the employee or of the corporation, or both of them combined, although the employment may be terminated at the will of either, but may continue while the employee lives. His employment with the corporation remains a part of what is called his 'record,' by which he must be judged whenever afterwards he may be in search of employment. The reputation of the dismissed employee is an essential part of his personal rights-of his right of personal security. 1 Black. Com. 129; 3 Black. Com. 119. Even the common law regarded \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 546]\n\u00a0\n a man's public repute as a fact having a bearing upon his ability to earn a livelihood; looked upon a good reputation in a particular trade or calling as having special pecuniary value; regarded a prospective employer as privileged to make inquiries about what his would-be employee had done in a former place of employment; conferred upon the former employer a privilege to communicate the truth in reply. What more reasonable than for the Legislature of Missouri to deem that the public interest required it to treat corporations as having, in a peculiar degree, the reputation and well-being of their former employees in their keeping, and to convert what otherwise might be but a legal privilege, or under prevailing customs a 'moral duty,' into a legal duty, by requiring, as this statute does, that when an employee has been discharged, or has voluntarily left the service it shall give him, on his request, a letter setting forth the nature and character of his service and its duration, and truly stating what cause, if any, led him to quit suit service.\n It is not for us to point out the grounds upon which the state Legislature acted, or to indicate all the grounds that occur to us as being those upon which they may have acted. We have not attempted to do this, but merely to indicate sufficient grounds upon which they reasonable might have acted and possibly did act to show that it is not demonstrated that they acted arbitrarily, and hence that there is no sufficient reason for holding that the statute deprives the corporation of its liberty or property without due process of law.\n The argument under the 'equal protection' clause is unsubstantial. As we are assured by the opinion of the Supreme Court, the mischiefs to which the statute is directed are peculiarly an outgrowth of existing practices of corporations, and are susceptible of a corrective in their case not so readily applied in the case of individual employers, presumably less systematic in their methods of \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 547]\n\u00a0\n employment and dismissal. There is no difficulty, therefore, in sustaining the Legislature in placing corporations in one class and individuals in another. See Mallinckrodt Works v. State, \n238 U.S. 41\n, 55-56, 35 Sup. Ct. 671. And the act applies to all corporations doing business in the state, whether incorporated under its laws or not.\n It is assigned for error, aside from the statute, that the decision of the Missouri court sustaining the cause of action under the second count amounts to depriving plaintiff in error of property without due process of law. This point was set up properly in the state courts as a special claim of immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment; and although under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214), it could not have been made the basis of a writ of error from this court, but only a writ of certiorari, we think that, by the fair intendment of the act, since the record has been brought here properly under a writ of error because involving the constitutionality of a statute, plaintiff in error is at liberty to assign any other ground of error therein, based upon an adverse decision by the state court of last resort upon any right, title, privilege, or immunity especially set up or claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n The pith of the objection to the second count is that to permit a recovery against plaintiff in error on account of the agreement said to have been made between it and two other companies having a monopoly of the industrial life insurance business in the city of St. Louis, to the effect that neither of the three would within two years employ any man who had left the service of or been discharged by either of the others, was equivalent to depriving it of property without 'due process of law.' The Supreme Court held (Cheek v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 192 S. W. 393) that the corporations had no lawful right to enter into a combination or \n\n[259 U.S. 530, 548]\n\u00a0\n agreement the effect of which was to take from them the right to employ whomsoever they deemed proper, and at the same time deprive former employees of their constitutional right to seek employment. It seems to us clear that the state might, without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, enact through its legislative department a statute precisely to the same effect as the rule of law and public policy declared by its court of last resort. And for the purposes of our jurisdiction it makes no difference, under that amendment, through what department the state has acted. The decision is as valid as a statute would be. No question of 'equal protection' is raised here.\n The judgment under review must be and is\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN v. CHICAGO, B. & Q. R. CO.(1922)\nNo. 206\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding out of which this case has grown, known as the 'Wisconsin Passenger Fares,' began in an investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission, under paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 416 of the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 484), into alleged undue and unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce arising out of intrastate railroad rates in Wisconsin. The interstate carriers by steam railroad of the state were \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n made respondents, and the Governor and State Railroad Commission were duly notified. The Interstate Commerce Commission made its report and order November 27, 1920. Wisconsin Passenger Fares, 59 Interest. Com. Comn. R. 391.\n The Commission had investigated the interstate rates of carriers in the United States, in a proceeding known as Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 58 Interst. Com. Comn. R. 220, for the purpose of complying with section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 422 of the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 488). That section requires that the Commission so adjust rates that the revenues of the carriers shall enable them as a whole or by groups to earn a fixed net income on their railway property. The Commission ordered an increase for the carriers in the group of which the Wisconsin carriers were a part, of 35 per cent. in interstate freight tates, and 20 per cent. in interstate passenger fares and excess baggage charges, and a surcharge upon passengers in sleeping cars amounting to 50 per cent. of the charge for space in such cars to accrue to the rail carriers. Thereupon the carriers applied to the Wisconsin Railroad Commission for corresponding increases in intrastate rates. The state commission granted increases in intrastate freight rates of 35 per cent., but denied any in intrastate passenger fares and charges on the sole ground that a state statute prescribed a maximum for passengers of 2 cents a mile.\n In the Wisconsin Passenger Fares, the Interstate Commerce Commission found that all of the respondent carriers of Wisconsin transported both intrastate and interstate passengers on the same train, with the same service and accommodations; that the state passenger paying the lower rate rode on the same train, in the same car, and perhaps in the same seat with the interstate passenger who paid the higher rate; that the circumstances and conditions were substantially similar for interstate as for intrastate passenger service in Wisconsin; that travelers destined \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n to, or coming from, points outside the state, found it cheaper to pay the intrastate fare within Wisconsin and the interstate fare beyond the border than to pay the through interstate fare; that undue preference and prejudice were shown by the falling off of sales of tickets from border line points in Minnesota and Michigan to stations in Wisconsin, and by a marked increase in sales of local tickets from corresponding border line points in Wisconsin to stations in Wisconsin; that the evidence as to the practice with respect to passenger fares applied in like manner to the surcharge upon passengers in sleeping and parlor cars and to excess baggage charges.\n The Commission further found that the fare necessary to fulfill the requirement as to net income of this interstate railroad group under section 15a was 3.6 cents per mile, and that this was reasonable, that the direct revenue loss to the Wisconsin carriers, due to their failure to secure the 20 per cent. increase in intrastate fares, would approximate $2, 400,000 per year if the 3-cent fare fixed by the President under federal war control were continued, and $6,000,000 per year if the 2-cent fare named in the state statute should become effective.\n The Commission found that there was undue, unreasonable and unjust discrimination against persons traveling in interstate commerce and against interstate commerce as a whole; and ordered that the undue discrimination should be removed by increases in all intrastate passenger fares and excess baggage charges and by surcharges corresponding with the increases and surcharges ordered in interstate business.\n The order was made without prejudice to the right of the authorities of the state or of any other party in interest to apply in the proper manner for a modification of the order as to any specified intrastate fares or charges if the latter were not related to the interstate fares or charges in such a way as to contravene the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379). \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n The carriers filed bills in equity, of which the present is one, in the District Court to enjoin the State Railroad Commission and other state officials from interfering with the maintenance of the fares thus ordered and published.\n Application for interlocutory injunction was made to the District Court under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). After a hearing before three judges, they granted an interlocutory injunction from which this appeal was taken.\n Messrs. M. B. Olbrich and Ralph M. Hoyt, both of Madison, Wis., for appellants.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Bruce Scott, of Chicago, Ill., Alfred P. Thom, of Washington, D. C., and Kenneth F. Burgess, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 563, 578]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John E. Benton, of Washington, D. C., for 45 States, amici curiae.\n Mr. Patrick J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commission's order, interference with which was enjoined by the District Court, effects the removal of the unjust discrimination found to exist against persons in interstate commerce, and against interstate commerce by fixing a minimum for intrastate passenger fares in Wisconsin at 3.6 cents per mile per passenger. This is done under paragraph 4 of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920, which authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a prescribed investigation, to remove--\n'Any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 579]\n\u00a0\n or unjust discrimination against interstate commerce.'\n\n We have two questions to decide.\n First. Do the intrastate passenger fares work undue prejudice against persons in interstate commerce, such as to justify a horizontal increase of them all?\n Second. Are these intrastate fares an undue discrimination against interstate commerce as a whole which it is the duty of the Commission to remove?\n We shall consider these in their order.\n First. The report and findings of the Commission undoubtedly show that the intrastate fares work an undue discrimination against travelers in interstate commerce and against localities (Houston & Texas Ry. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 342\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 833) in typical instances numerous enough to justify a general finding against a large class of fares. In a general order thus supported, possible injustice can be avoided by a saving clause allowing any one to except himself from the order by proper showing. This practice is fully sustained by precedent in what was done as a sequence of the Shreveport Case (Houston & Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, supra). See Meredith v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., 34 Interst. Com. Comn. R. 472; Railroad Comn. of Louisiana v. Arkansas Harbor Terminal Railway Co., 41 Interst. Com. Comn. R. 83; Eastern Texas R. R. Co. v. R. R. Commission (D. C.) 242 Fed. 300; Looney v. R. R. Co., \n247 U.S. 214\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 460. In Illinois C. R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 508\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 170, this court indicated its approval of such practice which was adopted by the Commission. Business Men's League of St. Louis v. Atchison & S. F. R. Co., 49 Interst. Com. Comn. R. 713. Any rule which would require specific proof of discrimination as to each fare or rate and its effect would completely block the remedial purpose of the statute.\n The order in this case, however, is much wider than the orders made in the proceedings following the Shreveport and Illinois Central Cases. There, as here, the report of the Commission showed discrimination against persons \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 580]\n\u00a0\n and localities at border points, and the orders were extended to include all rates or fares from all points in the state to border points. But this order is not so restricted. It includes fares between all interior points although neither may be near the border and the fares between them may not work a discrimination against interstate travelers at all. Nothing in the precedents cited justifies an order affecting all rates of a general description when it is clear that this would include many rates not within the proper class or the reason of the order. In such a case, the saving clause by which exceptions are permitted cannot give the order validity. As said by this court in the Illinois Central R. R. Case:\n'It is obvious that an order of a subordinate agency, such as the Commission, should not be given precedence over a state rate statute otherwise valid, unless, and except so far as, it conforms to a high standard of certainty.'\n\n See, also, American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 627\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 656\n\n\n If, in view of the changes, made by federal authority, in a large class of discriminating state rates, it is necessary from a state point of view to change nondiscriminating state rates to harmonize with them, only the state authorities can produce such harmony. We cannot sustain the sweep of the order in this case on the showing of discriminations against persons or places alone.\n Second. The report of the Commission shows that if the intrastate passenger fares in Wisconsin are to be limited by the statute of that state to 2 cents per mile, and charges for extra baggage and sleeping car accommodations are to be reduced in a corresponding degree, the net income of the interstate carriers of the state will be cut six millions of dollars below what it would be under intrastate rates on the same level with interstate rates. Under paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 13 and section 15a as enacted in sections 416 and 422 respectively of the Transportation Act \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 581]\n\u00a0\n of 1920 (which are given in part in the margin1), are such reduction and disparity an 'undue, unreasonable or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce' which the Interstate Commerce Commission may remove by raising the intrastate fares? A short reference to the circumstances inducing the legislation and a summary of its relevant provisions will aid the answer to this question. \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 582]\n\u00a0\n The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 379, was enacted by Congress to prevent interstate railroad carriers from charging unreasonable rates and from unjustly discriminating between persons and localities. The railroads availed themselves of the weakness and cumbrous machinery of the original law to defeat its purpose, and this led to various amendments culminating in the amending Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 539, in which the authority of the Commission in dealing with the carriers was made summary and effectively complete. Whatever the causes, the fact was that the carrying capacity of the railroads did not thereafter develop proportionately with the growth of the country, and it became difficult for them\n'(4) Whenever in any such investigation the Commission, after full hearing, finds that any such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice causes any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful, it shall prescribe the rate, fare, or charge, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, thereafter to be charged, and the classification, regulation, or practice thereafter to be observed in such manner as, in its judgment, will remove such advantage, preference, prejudice, or discrimination. Such rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations, and practices shall be observed while in effect by the carriers parties to such proceeding affected thereby, the law of any state or the decision or order of any state authority to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n Section 422 of the Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. L. 488.\n The Interstate Commerce Act is further amended by inserting, after section 15, a new section to be known as section 15a and to read as follows:\n'Section 15a(1) ...\n\n'(2) In the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates, the Commission shall initiate, modify, establish or adjust such rates so that carriers as a whole (or as a whole in each of such rate groups or territories as the Commission may from time to time designate) will, under honest, efficient and economical management and reasonable expenditures for maintenance of way, structures and equipment, earn an aggregate annual net railway operating income equal, as nearly as may be, to fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation. ... \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 583]\n\u00a0\n to secure additional investment of capital on feasible terms. When the extraordinary demand for transportation arose in 1917, the Congress and the President concluded to take over all the railroads into the management of the Federal Government, and by joint use of facilities, which the Anti- Trust Law (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.) was thought to forbid under private management and by use of Government credit, to increase their effectiveness. This was done by appropriate legislation and executive action under the war power. From January 1, 1918, until March 1, 1920, when the Transportation Act went into effect, the common carriers by steam railroad of the country were operated by the Federal Government. Due to the rapid rise in the \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 584]\n\u00a0\n prices of material and labor in 1918 and 1919, the expense of their operation had enormously increased by the time it was proposed to return the railroads to their owners. The owners insisted that their properties could not be turned back to them by the Government for useful operation without provision to aid them to meet a situation in which they were likely to face a demoralizing lack of credit and income. Congress acquiesced in this view. The Transportation Act of 1920 was the result. It was adopted after elaborate investigations by the Interstate Commerce Committees of the two Houses.\n\n Under title 2 it made provision for the termination of federal control March 1, 1920, for the refunding of the carriers' indebtedness to the United States, and for a guaranty for six months to the carriers of an income equal to the war-time rental for their properties, and directed that for two years following the termination of federal control, the Secretary of the Treasury, upon certificate of the Commission might make loans to the carriers not exceeding the maximum amount recommended in the certificate, out of a revolving fund of $300,000,000.\n Under title 4, amendments were made to the Interstate Commerce Act which included section 13, paragraphs 3 and 4, and section 15a, already quoted in the margin. The former for the first time authoirzes the Commission to deal directly with intrastate rates where they are unduly discriminating against interstate commerce-a power already indirectly exercised as to persons and localities, with approval of this court in the Shreveport and other cases. The latter, the most novel and most important feature of the act, requires the Commission so to prescribe rates as to enable the carriers as a whole or in groups selected by the Commission, to earn an aggregate annual net railway operating income equal to a fair return on the aggregate value of the railway property used in transportation. For two years, the return is to be \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 585]\n\u00a0\n 5 1\/2 per cent., with 1\/2 per cent. for improvements, and thereafter is to be fixed by the Commission.\n The act sought to avoid excessive incomes accruing, under the operation of section 15a, to the carriers better circumstanced by using the excess for loans to the others and for other purposes. The act further put under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission, first, the issuing of future railroad securities by the interstate carriers; second, the regulation of their car supply and distribution and the joint use of terminals; and, third, their construction of new lines, and their abandonment of old lines. The validity of some of these provisions has been questioned. Upon that we express no opinion. We only refer to them to show the scope of the congressional purpose in the act.\n It is manifest from this very condensed recital that the act made a new departure. Theretofore the control which Congress through the Interstate Commerce Commission exercised was primarily for the purpose of preventing injustice by unreasonable or discriminatory rates against persons and localities, and the only provisions of the law that inured to the benefit of the carriers were the requirement that the rates should be reasonable in the sense of furnishing an adequate compensation for the particular service rendered and the abolition of rebates. The new measure imposed an affirmative duty on the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix rates and to take other important steps to maintain an adequate railway service for the people of the United States. This is expressly declared in section 15a to be one of the purposes of the bill.\n Intrastate rates and the income from them must play a most important part in maintaining an adequate national railway system. Twenty per cent. of the gross freight receipts of the railroads of the country are from intrastate traffic, and 50 per cent. of the passenger receipts. The ratio of the gross intrastate revenue to the \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 586]\n\u00a0\n interstate revenue is a little less than one to three. If the rates, on which such receipts are based, are to be fixed at a substantially lower level than in interstate traffic, the share which the intrastate traffic will contribute will be proportionately less. If the railways are to earn a fixed net percentage of income, the lower the intrastate rates, the higher the interstate rates may have to be. The effective operation of the act will reasonably and justly require that intrastate traffic should pay a fair proportionate share of the cost of maintaining an adequate railway system. Section 15a confers no power on the Commission to deal with intrastate rates. What is done under that section is to be done by the Commission 'in the exercise of its powers to prescribe just and reasonable rates,' i. e., powers derived from previous amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act, which have never been construed or used to embrace the prescribing of intrastate rates. When we turn to paragraph 4,  13, however, and find the Commission for the first time vested with a direct power to remove 'any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce,' it is impossible to escape the dovetail relation between that provision and the purpose of section 15a. If that purpose is interfered with by a disparity of intrastate rates, the Commission is authorized to end the disparity by directly removing it, because it is plainly an 'undue, unreasonable, and unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce,' within the ordinary meaning of those words.\n Counsel for appellants, not able to satisfy their meaning by the suggestion of any other discrimination to which they apply, are forced to the position that the words are tautological and a mere repetition of 'any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference or prejudice as between persons and localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand,' which precede them. In view of their apt application \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 587]\n\u00a0\n to the most not at liberty to take such a view. If 'undue, not at liaberty to take such a view. It 'undue, unreasonable and unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce' are tautological, why are they followed by the phrase 'which is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful'? To accompany a meaningless phrase with words of such special emphasis would be unusual.\n It is urged that in previous decisions notably the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18, the Shreveport Case, supra, and the Illinois Central Case, supra, the expression 'unjust discrimination against interstate commerce' was often used when, as the law then was, it could only mean discrimination as between persons and localities, and therefore that it is to be given the same limited meaning here. But, here, the general words are used after discrimination against persons and localities have been specifically mentioned. The natural inference is that even if they include what has gone before, they mean something more. When we find that they aptly include a kind of discrimination against interstate commerce which the operation of the new act for the first time makes important and which would seriously obstruct its chief purpose, we cannot ignore their necessary effect.\n Counsel for appellants are driven by the logic of their position to maintain that the valuation required for the purposes of section 15a to be ascertained pursuant to section 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act (37 Stat. L. 701; amended 41 Stat. L. 493) is to be only of that part of the property and equipment of the interstate carriers which is used in commerce among the states and must be segregated from that used in intrastate commerce. This is contrary to the construction which since the enactment of section 19a, March 1, 1913, the Commission has put upon that section in carrying out its injunction. It is inadmissible. The language of section 15a refutes such interpretation. The percentage \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 588]\n\u00a0\n is to be calculated on 'the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation.' To impose on the Commission the duty of separating property used in the two services when so much of it is used in both, and to do this in a reasonably short time for practical use, as contemplated by the statute, would be to assign it a well-nigh impossible task. This, of itself, prevents our giving the words such a construction unless they clearly require it. They certainly do not.\n It is objected here, as it was in the Shreveport Case, that orders of the Commission which raise the intrastate rates to a level of the interstate structure, violate the specific proviso of the original Interstate Commerce Act repeated in the amending acts, that the Commission is not to regulate traffic wholly within a state. To this, the same answer must be made as was made in the Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 358\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 833, that such orders as to intrastate traffic are merely incidental to the regulation of interstate commerce and necessary to its efficiency. Effective control of the one must embrace some control over the other in view of the blending of both in actual operation. The same rails and the same cars carry both. The same men conduct them. Commerce is a unit and does not regard state lines, and while under the Constitution, interstate and intrastate commerce are ordinarily subject to regulation by different sovereignties, yet when they are so mingled together that the supreme authority, the Nation, cannot exercise complete effective control over interstate commerce without incidental regulation of intrastate commerce, such incidental regulation is not an invasion of state authority of a violation of the proviso.\n Great stress is put on the legislative history of the Transportation Act to show that the bill was not intended to confer on the Commission power to remove any discrimination against interstate commerce involved in a \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 589]\n\u00a0\n general disparity between interstate and intrastate rates. Committee reports and explanatory statements of members in charge made in presenting a bill for passage have been held to be a legitimate aid to the interpretation of a statute where its language is doubtful or obscure. Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 475\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172. But when taking the act as a whole, the effect of the language used is clear to the court, extraneous aid like this cannot control the interpretation. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 198\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 490\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 1168. Such aids are only admissible to solve doubt and not to create it. For the reasons given, we have no doubt in this case.\n Counsel for the appellants have not contested the constitutional validity of the statute construed as we have construed it, although the counsel for the state commissions whom we permitted to file briefs as amici curiae have done so. The principles laid down by this court in the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 432\n, 433 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18, the Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 833, and the Illinois Central Case, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 506\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 170, Which are rates cases, and in the analogous cases of Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commision, \n221 \nU.S. 612, 618\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 621; Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 27 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 2; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 51 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44, we think, leave no room for discussion on this point. Congress in its control of its interstate commerce system is seeking in the Transportation Act to make the system adequate to the needs of the country by securing for it a reasonable compensatory return for all the work it does. The states are seeking to use that same system for intrastate traffic. That entails large duties and expenditures on the interstate commerce system which may burden it unless compensation is received for the intrastate business reasonably proportionate to that for the \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 590]\n\u00a0\n interstate business. Congress as the dominant controller of interstate commerce may, therefore, restrain undue limitation of the earning power of the interstate commerce system in doing state work. The affirmative power of Congress in developing interstate commerce agencies is clear. Wilson v. Shaw, \n204 U.S. 24\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 233; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., \n153 U.S. 525\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 891; California v. Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1, 39\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1073. In such development, it can impose any reasonable condition on a state's use of interstate carriers for intrastate commerce, it deems necessary or desirable. This is because of the supremacy of the national power in this field.\n In Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 399\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 739, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18, where relevant cases were carefully reviewed, it was said:\n'The authority of Congress extends to every part of interstate commerce, and to every instrumentality or agency by which it is carried on; and the full control by Congress of the subjects committed to its regulation is not to be denied or thwarted by the commingling of interstate and intrastate operations. This is not to say that the Nation may deal with the internal concerns of the state, as such, but that the execution by Congress of its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce is not limited by the fact that intrastate transactions may have become so interwoven therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter. This conclusion necessarily results from the supremacy of the national power within its appointed sphere.'\n\n It is said that our conclusion gives the Commission unified control of interstate and intrastate commerce. It is only unified to the extent of maintaining efficient regulation of interstate commerce under the paramount power of Congress. It does not involve general regulation of intrastate commerce. Action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this regard should be directed to substantial disparity which operates as a real discrimination \n\n[257 U.S. 563, 591]\n\u00a0\n against, and obstruction to, interstate commerce, and must leave appropriate discretion to the state authorities to deal with intrastate rates as between themselves on the general level which the Interstate Commerce Commission has found to be fair to interstate commerce.\n It may well turn out that the effect of a general order increasing all rates, like the one at bar, will, in particular localities, reduce income instead of increasing it, by discouraging patronage. Such cases would be within the saving clause of the order herein, and make proper, an application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for appropriate exception. So, too, in practice when the state commissions shall recognize their obligation to maintain a proportionate and equitable share of the income of the carriers from intrastate rates, conference between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state commissions may dispense with the necessity for any rigid federal order as to the intrastate rates, and leave to the state commissions power to deal with them and increase them or reduce them in their discretion.\n The order of the District Court granting the interlocutory injunction is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 13 of section 416 and section 15a of section 422 of the same act are as follows:\n'(3) Whenever in any investigation under the provisions of this act, or in any investigation instituted upon petition of the carrier concerned, which petition is hereby authorized to be filed, there shall be brought in issue any rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice, made or imposed by authority of any state, or initiated by the President during the period of Federal control, the Commission, before proceeding to hear and dispose of such issue, shall cause the state or states interested to be notified of the proceeding. The Commission may confer with the authorities of any state having regulatory jurisdiction over the class of persons and corporations subject to this act with respect to the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such state bodies and of the Commission; and to that end is authorized and empowered, under rules to be prescribed by it, and which may be modified from time to time, to hold joint hearings with any such state regulating bodies on any matters wherein the Commission is empowered to act and where the rate-making authority of a state is or may be affected by the action taken by the Commission. The Commission is also authorized to avail itself of the cooperation, services, records, and facilities of such state authorities in the enforcement of any provision of this act. \n\n'(3) The Commission shall from time to time determine and make public what percentage of such aggregate property value constitutes a fair return thereon, and such percentage shall be uniform for all rate groups or territories which may be designated by the Commission. In making such determination, it shall give due consideration, among other things, to the transportation needs of the country and the necessity (under honest, efficient and economical management of existing transportation facilities) of enlarging such facilities in order to provide the people of the United States with adequate transportation. Provided that during two years beginning March 1, 1920, the Commission shall take as such fair return a sum equal to 5 1\/2 per centum of such aggregate value, but may, in its discretion, add thereto a sum not exceeding one-half of one per centum of such aggregage value to make provision in whole or in part for improvements, betterments or equipment, which, according to the accounting system prescribed by the Commission, are chargeable to capital account.\n\n'(4) For the purposes of this section, such aggregate value of the property of the carriers shall be determined by the Commission from time to time and as often as may be necessary. The Commission may utilize the results of its investigation under section 19a of this act, in so far as deemed by it available, and shall give due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate-making purposes, and shall give to the property investment account of the carriers only that consideration which under such law it is entitled to in establishing values for rate-making purposes. Whenever pursuant to section 19a of this act, the value of the railway property of any carrier held for and used in the service of transportation has been finally ascertained, the value so ascertained shall be deemed by the Commission to be the value thereof for the purpose of determining such aggregate value.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAINIER BREWING CO. v. GREAT NORTHERN PAC. S. S. CO.(1922)\nNo. 267\nArgued: April 21, 1922Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 150, 151]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. J. Wettrick, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles A. Hart, of Portland, Or., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1917 the plaintiff in error shipped two carloads of beer from San Francisco, consigned to the American Transfer & Drayage Company at Seattle, Wash., which contained 2,565 separate packages or cases addressed to separate individuals. The shipment moved by water to Flavel, Or., thence by a line of railway to Portland, Ore., and thence by the Northern Pacific Railroad to Seattle. It was billed in carload lots, and was given a through carload rate at point of origin, which was paid.\n When the cars reached Portland the Northern Pacific Company refused to accept them, claiming that it could not lawfully carry intoxicating liquors in carload lots into the state of Washington, under the laws of the United States and of that state. Thereupon the liquor \n\n[259 U.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n was rebilled, each package or case separately, and the railroad company carried it to Seattle and delivered it to the individual consignees.\n This suit is by the railroad company to recover the difference between the carload and the less than carload rate for the shipment. The case was tried on stipulated facts, and, a jury being waived, the District Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The parties agree that only one question is presented for decision, viz.: Could the railroad company have lawfully transported the beer to Seattle and have delivered it to the transfer company, the consignee named in the bill of lading, in carload lots?\n To answer this question involves the construction and application of section 240 of the federal Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10410) of the Webb- Kenyon Act (37 Stat. 699, c. 90 [Comp. St.  8739]), and of several sections of Chapter 1-A of Title 47 of the Laws of Washington entitled 'Prohibition and Regulation' (Remington's Codes and Statutes of Washington 1915, vol. 2,  6262-1 to 6262-22, inclusive).\n Section 240 of the federal Criminal Code provides:\n'Whoever shall knowingly ship ... from one state ... into any other state ... any package of or package containing any ... intoxicating liquor of any kind, unless such package be so labeled on the outside cover as to plainly show the name of the consignee, the nature of its contents, and the quantity contained therein, shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars. ...'\n\n The Webb-Kenyon Act prohibited the 'shipment or transportation, in any manner or by any means whatsoever,' of any intoxicating liquors of any kind from one state to another state to be received or in any manner used in violation of any law of any such latter state (37 Stat. p. 699, c. 80). With these laws in force at the time, the railroad company could carry the beer into Washington only when labeled as required by section 240, supra, and in \n\n[259 U.S. 150, 153]\n\u00a0\n the manner allowed by the laws of that state (Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Railway Co., \n242 U.S. 311\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845), which we shall briefly consider.\n Section 6262-29 of the state law, cited supra, limited the amount of liquor which any person, other than a common carrier, could bring into the state at one time to not more than 12 quarts of beer or one-half gallon of other liquor, and even this amount could lawfully be imported only under a permit issued by a county auditor. Only one such permit could be issued to any one person in any 20-day period. Section 6262-16.\n'Any person desiring to ship or transport any intoxicating liquor' in the state must secure a permit which could be obtained only by an application to the county auditor, in which must be given under oath the name and age of the applicant, the name of the person (or corporation) from whom and the places from and to which the shipment was to be made. Section 6262-15. 'Such permit shall be printed upon some shade of red paper,' read the law, and must be substantially in the following form:\n\n'State of Washington, County of ..... ss.\n\n'....., residing at ....., is hereby permitted to ship or transport from ....., in the state of ....., to ....., in the county of ....., state of Washington, intoxicating liquor, to wit: ..... (insert kind and quantity, not exceeding in quantity one-half gallon of intoxicating liquor other than beer, or twelve quarts of beer or twenty-four pints of beer). This permit can only be used for one shipment and will be void after thirty days from the date of issue.\n\n'Dated this ... day of ..... 19 ..\n\n'........, County Auditor.'\n\n The law further required that the permit should be conspicuously affixed to each package or parcel containing \n\n[259 U.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n liquor brought into the state, and when so affixed it authorized any railroad company to transport not to exceed in one package or parcel the limited amount specified. It was further declared to be unlawful for any railroad company to knowingly transport such liquor in the state without having the required permit conspicuously attached to each parcel containing it, and the carrier was required to so cancel the permit that it could not be used again. It was made unlawful for any person to receive such liquor which did not have the required permit attached thereto and properly canceled. See  6262-15 and 6262-18. Each package must be 'clearly and plainly marked in large letters: 'This Package Contains Intoxicating Liquors.\"\n This statement of the applicable law shows that the purpose of the legislation was to make the transportation of intoxicating liquors in the state of Washington as difficult, conspicuous and expensive as possible. Only an individual could qualify to ship or receive it and it was intended that it should move only in a single package of strictly limited quantity, with a permit attached, showing its origin, destination and the name of the shipper who must also be the ultimate consignee. A carrier could lawfully receive it for transportation only when the required permit was attached and it was made its legal duty to deface and cancel such permit before delivery so that it could not again be used. It is stipulated that all of the statutory requirements as to packing, permits and markings were complied with as to the packages here involved, but it is argued that when so prepared for shipment the statute permitted the beer to be carried, not only by a railroad company, but also by 'any person, firm or corporation operating any vehicle for transportation of goods' and that, therefore, the railroad company could have discharged all of its obligations under the law by making bulk delivery of the carload lots to the transfer company for distribution and delivery to the permittees, \n\n[259 U.S. 150, 155]\n\u00a0\n who were the ultimate and real consignees, trusting to that company to make only legal deliveries and to cancel all permits as required by the statute.\n With this contention we cannot agree.\n The line of the railroad company extended to Seattle, the destination of the beer, and the state statute rendered the permittee the ultimate and real consignee. Under the general law of carriers, it was the duty of the railroad company to make delivery to the consignees, either at its station or at their residences or places of business, conformably to local custom, and the requirement of the statute that the delivering carrier must deface and cancel the permit on each package, added to the imperative character of this obligation. Delivery under the terms of the original bill of lading would have been to the Transfer Company, not as a carrier authorized by law to transport the beer on its way to destination, but to it as a terminal consignee and as such it could not possibly have qualified under the state law. No further transportation was required, only delivery remained.\n The markings of the packages, required by both the federal and state law, advised the railroad company of the character of their contents and as to the real consignees and that they resided in Seattle and we think, therefore, that it was clearly its duty to refuse to carry the beer in carload bulk shipments for delivery to the transfer company, and that it was within its legal rights in insisting that the traffic be billed in a form which would render convenient such inspection as was necessary to insure conformity to the law in the markings of packages, and such as would render it possible for the company to make delivery to consignees with the permits canceled as the statute required.\n It results that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREED v. DIRECTOR GENERAL OF RAILROADS(1922)\nNo. 78\nArgued: January 13, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. John J. McDevitt, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., and Frederick S. Tyler, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. Clarke Mason, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[258 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas at Philadelphia, alleged that her husband was negligently killed while employed in interstate commerce by the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad, and demanded damages. She claimed under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665). Verdict and judgment having been entered for her, an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the state, and reversal sought upon several grounds. That court considered only one question-Did decedent's death result from a risk which he assumed as the result of his employment? And, concluding that he had assumed such risk, it reversed the judgment of the trial court, and entered one for respondent non obstante veredicto. 267 Pa. 86, 110 Atl. 254. As found and stated by the Supreme Court, the facts are these: \n\n[258 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n 'Decedent was a member of a crew which had brought a train from Philadelphia to South Bethlehem. Some of the cars contained goods shipped in interstate commerce. When all the cars were released at their appropriate places, the engine went back to get the caboose for the purpose of taking it to the point where it was to stay until wanted for further traffic, and then itself go to the roundhouse where it was to remain until again needed. This movement was through defendant's yard, where there were a number of tracks upon which cars and locomotives were being shifted constantly. Through the yard ran also the main passenger tracks of defendant, and, at the points where other tracks crossed over or connected therewith, derailing devices had been wisely installed for the purpose of preventing locomotives and cars using the other tracks from running on to or over the passenger tracks, at a time when passenger trains were standing or traveling thereon, and thereby possibly causing collision and serious loss of life.\n'The engine and caboose which had reached South Bethlehem were moving over a track which had one of those derailing devices where it connected with the passenger tracks. The caboose being in front of the locomotive the engineer could not see the device when operating the engine from his cab and hence decedent was directed to and did locate himself on the front of the caboose, with a duty to signal the engineer in time for him to safely stop if the derailing device was set against further passage. It was so set on this occasion, but either through the negligence of decedent himself, or of the engineer in failing to notice or heed the signaling of decedent, the locomotive did not stop in time, the caboose was derailed and decedent was crushed to death between it and cars on an adjoining track.'\n\n Accepting the view that the engineer's negligence was the proximate cause of the fatal injury, the court below \n\n[258 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n held the decedent had assumed the risk of such negligence and the master was not liable, citing among other cases Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475. This we think was error.\n Seaboard Air Line v. Horton-often followed-ruled that the federal Employers' Liability Act did not wholly abolish the defense of assumption of risk as recognized and applied at common law. But the opinion distinctly states that the first section--\n'has the effect of abolishing in this class of cases the common-law rule that exempted the employer from responsibility for the negligence of a fellow employee of the plaintiff.'\n\n The Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 175 (56 L. Ed. 327, 38 L. R. A [N. S.] 44), declared that--\n'The rule that the negligence of one employee resulting in injury to another was not to be attributed to their common employer, is displaced by a rule imposing upon the employer responsibility for such an injury, as was done at common law when the injured person was not an employee.'\n\n And in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Ward, \n252 U.S. 18\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 275, we said:\n'The federal Employers' Liability Act places a coemployee's negligence, when the ground of the action, in the same relation as that of the employer as regards assumption of risk.'\n\n See New York Central R. R. v. Carr, \n238 U.S. 260\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 780; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. DeAtley, \n241 \nU.S. 310, 313\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 564\n\n\n In actions under the federal act the doctrine of assumption of risk certainly has no application when the negligence of a fellow servant which the injured party could not have foreseen or expected, is the sole, direct, and immediate cause of the injury. To hold otherwise would conflict with the declaration of Congress that every common carrier by railroad while engaging in interstate commerce shall be liable to the personal representative of any employee killed while employed therein when death results from the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carriers. \n\n[258 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n For the reasons indicated, the judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREGAL DRUG CORPOATION v. WARDELL(1922)\nNo. 108\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. John W. Preston, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, Mrs. Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, and Mr. Robert P. Reeder, all of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case involves the legality of taxes. assessments or penalties under the revenue law or the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305), upon certain distilled spirits and liquors of the Regal Drug Corporation ( herein called complainant), and the distraint of its store and the property contained therein.\n The remedy sought is by injunction against respondent Wardell, as collector of internal revenue, from taking or continuing in possession of the store and its property, \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n or from conducting any action or proceeding to enforce the collection of the taxes, assessments or penalties.\n Complainant presented the grounds of its prayer in a bill of complaint filed in the Southern Division of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n The United States demurred to the bill on the ground, among others, that complainant had a 'plain, speedy, adequate and complete remedy at law.' The District Court sustained the demurrer and decreed the dismissal of the suit. The ruling and decree were affirmed upon appeal of complainant by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n The bill of complaint is an amended one. A summary of its allegations is all that is necessary and the facts alleged may be assumed to be true. They are as follows: The complainant is a corporation under the laws of California and the defendant (respondent here) is the United States collector of internal revenue for the First district of California. On the 28th day of October, 1919, complainant was the holder of a permit duly issued to it to sell intoxicating liquor and distilled spirits for nonbeverage purposes, and continued to be the holder thereof until some time in June, 1920, during which time it was in force.\n During that time complainant purchased and withdrew from the bonded warehouses distilled spirits and intoxicating liquors to the amount of 17, 900 gallons, and also 450 gallons of sweet wines containing not over 21 per cent. of alcohol, and purchased about 20 gallons of dry wines containing not over 14 per cent. of alcohol. All taxes and assessments against the spirits and liquors that were levied or could be levied were paid by the complainant in advance, and during the time the permit was in force complainant sold and disposed of the spirits and liquors under the permit, 'and under and in accordance with the provisions of the National Prohibition Act.' Complainant also complied \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n with the law in regard to filing a bond in the sum of $100,000.\n Complainant had in its drug store during the time mentioned, a stock of drugs, medicines and sundries of the value of about $15,000.\n That in or about the month of June, 1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue levied against complainant a so-called assessment or tax at the rate of $6.40 per gallon, amounting in the aggregate to $115,092.50 upon all distilled liquors that had been withdrawn by complainant from the bonded warehouses between October 28, 1919, and the time when complainant's permit to sell and dispose of the spirits was revoked, to wit, in the month of June, 1920\n\n\n The Commissioner also levied arbitrarily a so-called tax or assessment against complainant at the rate of 40 cents a gallon on the sweet wines purchased and disposed of by complainant, and 16 cents a gallon on the dry wines.\n None of the levies were either taxes or assessments but were fines and penalties imposed on complainant without notice or a hearing.\n Complainant had already paid taxes on all of the articles amounting to the sum of $39,656.89. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue claimed and claims there is due the further sum of $75,592.61.\n The Commissioner also levied against complainant a penalty of $500 for selling spirits in violation of law, and a penalty of $93.75 for conducting the business of a rectifier, in violation of law, and a penalty of $1,000 a month for having manufactured distilled spirits or intoxicating liquors in violation of law.\n The levies of the taxes and assessments were without notice or hearing, or that the same were proposed, and complainant was therefore, without knowledge or information of the proposed action or the basis or grounds of it. No evidence was taken or received by the Commissioner in regard thereto prior to the attempted levy. \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n On the 19th day of July, 1920, the Commissioner took possession of complainant's drug store and of the entire stock of drugs and goods therein, excluding complainant therefrom, and is proceeding to and threatening to sell the same in order to satisfy the so-called assessments or taxes and penalties, and that the damage done to complainant will be irreparable.\n The District Court, comparing the inconvenience and loss to the parties from a preliminary injunction, said it would grant one but for section 32241 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  5947), which the court considered applied, and forbade relief by injunction. The court also expressed a doubt of the validity of the tax, but was of the view that the fact did not preclude the application of the statute. For this conclusion the court cited Snyder v. Marks, \n109 U.S. 189\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 157; Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 U.S. 118\n, 36 Sup Ct. 275, and other cases.\n The court decreed the dismissal of the suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, citing the same cases, and expressed the view that they conclusively determined against relief by injunction, even if the tax could be considered 'in the nature of a penalty.'\n Since the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals we have decided a case which is a necessary factor to be considered. In Lipke v. Lederer, Collector, \n259 U.S. 557\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 549, decided June 5, 1922, the power of a collector of internal revenue under circumstances such as are presented by this record was passed upon, the limitations upon it, and the rights of one against whom it is attempted to be exercised.\n The case originated in the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was brought, as the case at bar is, to restrain the enforcement of a tax on the ground that it was the imposition of a penalty, not a tax, and was not preceded by a hearing. The bill was dismissed \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n by the District Court upon the authority of Ketterer v. Lederer, 269 Fed. 153, that case deciding that an injunction could not be issued to restrain the collection of a tax.\n The facts of the case were these: Lipke paid all revenue taxes required by the laws for the year ending June 30, 1920. He held a retail liquor license under the laws of the state. On December 29, 1920, he was arrested for selling liquor under the National Prohibition Act, and gave bail to appear and answer in the United States District Court.\n On March 18, 1921, he was notified that there was assessed against him a tax (its amount was stated), and, if not paid within 10 days, a penalty would be added to the tax. On March 31st, he received a second demand, and was advised that, if the tax and penalty were not paid within 10 days, collection of the same with accrued interest and costs would 'be made by seizure and sale of all property.'\n To restrain the execution of the threat, the suit was brought; Lipke alleging that he was 'wholly without adequate remedy at law to prevent such seizure of his property.'\n Passing on section 3224 of the Revised Statutes, which was urged against the suit, it was decided that the section had no application, and that section 35 of title 2 of the Prohibition Act did not confer the power the collector threatened to exercise. Describing the power, we said that the collector was undertaking to punish Lipke 'by fine and penalty for an alleged criminal offense without hearing, information, indictment or trial by jury, contrary to the federal constitution.' And we said further that if the 'section has the meaning ascribed to it by the defendant [the collector], it is unconstitutional.\n The distinction between a tax and a penalty was emphasized. The function of a tax, it was said, \"is to provide \n\n[260 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n for the support of the government\"; the function of a penalty clearly involves the 'idea of punishment for infringement of the law,' and that a condition of its imposition is notice and hearing. O'Sullivan v. Felix, \n233 \nU.S. 318, 324\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 596. And even if the imposition may be considered a tax, if it have punitive purpose, it must be preceded by opportunity to contest its validity. Central of Georgia Railway v. Wright, \n207 U.S. 127\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 47, 12 Ann. Cas. 463.\n We took pains to say that 'evidence of crime (section 29, tit. 2) is essential to assessment under section 35,' and that we could not 'concede, in the absence of language admitting of no other construction, that Congress intended that penalties for crime should be enforced through the secret findings and summary action of executive officers. The guaranties of due process of law and trial by jury are not to be forgotten or disregarded. See Fontenot v. Accardo (C. C. A.) 278 Fed. 871. A preliminary injunction should have been granted.'\n The comment and decision are applicable here, and decisive. The government concedes that the case is conclusive against the 'penalties and double taxes,' but contends that under tax laws which antedated the National Prohibition Act, only inconsistent laws are repealed, and that taxes in this case were levied under a law not inconsistent. For this section 35 is adduced. Lipke v. Lederer manifestly precludes the contention.\n The contention encounters, besides, the averments of the bill. They assert that all taxes that were or could be levied were paid by complainant, and that those against which the bill is directed were imposed without notice or hearing as penalties for criminal violations of the law. The facts are not denied. They impel the application of Lipke v. Lederer and the reversal of the action of the District Court and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 3224. No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court. \n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROAD DISTRICT v. ST. LOUIS SOUTHWESTERN RY. CO(1922)\nNo. 141\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n Co \n257 U.S. 547\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[257 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry Moore, Jr., of Texarkana, Ark., for petitioner. \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. R. Turney, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether a proceeding in a state county court to assess benefits and damages growing out of a road improvement was properly removed to the federal District Court.\n The assessors appointed by the county court of Lafayette county, Ark., for road improvement district No. 2, imposed an assessment on lands within the district, belonging to the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, a corporation of Missouri, of $49,706, for benefits from the projected improvement. The book of assessments for the district was filed by the district commissioners in the office of the county clerk and the day for \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n hearing objections by the landowners before the county court was duly advertised. On the day before the hearing, the railway company filed a petition for removal to the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, with the necessary bond. That court denied a motion to remand, tried the controversy between the commissioners of the road district and the railway company, reduced the assessment to $10,485.48, entered judgment therefor and certified the same to the county court. On error, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, and the case is here on certiorari.\n Under section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1010), a suit at common law or in equity between citizens of different states involving more than $3,000, may be removed by the nonresident party to the proper federal District Court. Under section 29 (Comp. St.  1011) the petition for removal must be filed on or before the day when defendant is required to answer. The petition herein was filed the day before the hearing as advertised, upon which day the landowner is required by state law to file his written objections. Thus the requisites of the removal statute were fulfilled, if the proceeding was a suit at common law in a state court.\n Road district improvements are provided for in chapter 81, title 7, Crawford & Moses' Statutes of Arkansas. A district is formed upon a petition of a majority of the landowners by the county court's approval of the district and the projected improvement. C. & M. Dig.  5399. The district then becomes a corporation, with a seal and capable of contracting and suing and being sued. C. & M. Dig.  5402, 5404. The court appoints three commissioners, who are the governing body of the corporation. C. & M. Dig.  5405 and 5407. After appointment, they cannot be removed by the county court, but are independent. Taylor v. Wallace, 143 Ark. 67, 219 S. W. 314. They submit to the county court a plan for the improvement and estimate its cost. C. & M. Dig.  5409-5419. The county court \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n then appoints three assessors, whose duty it is to assess the enhanced value which the improvement will give to the various lots of real estate ( C. & M. Dig.  5419, 5421), as well as the damages, if any, 'by reason of right of way taken or other damage sustained' (C. & M. Dig.  5419, 5421, 5422). The damages 'may be paid out of the funds of the district, or by a reduction in the assessment of benefits in proportion to the amount of damages sustained.' C. & M. Dig.  5422. The assessments of benefits and damages are noted by the assessors in a permanent book. C. & M. Dig.  5421. The subsequent proceedings as to hearing and judgment are set forth in C. & M. Dig.  5423 and 5424, given below in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Appeals from the judgment of the county court as to assessments of benefits and damages may be taken to the circuit court, the court of general jurisdiction, either by the owner or the commissioners of the district 'by filing an affidavit for appeal and stating therein the special matter appealed from, but such appeal shall affect only the particular tract of land ... concerning which said appeal is taken.' C. & M. Dig. pars. 5425, 5427; Wapponocca Outing Club v. Road Imp. District, 135 Ark. 196, 204 S. W. 840. The circuit court tries all such appeals \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n denovo as if originally brought in that court (C. & M. Dig. par. 2236), and the judgment is in the same form as in the inferior court (Wilson v. Hinton, 63 Ark. 145, 38 S. W. 338).\n Just as soon as the assessment book is filed in the office of the county clerk who is ex officio clerk of the county court, and the commissioners submit the estimate of cost of the improvement, the county court, pending its hearing of objections to assessments, levies an assessment against all the real property in the district, adding 10 per cent. to the estimated cost for contingencies, to be collected against the properties in proportion to the benefits then to be adjudged. C. & M. Dig .  5432. The assessments thus determined and confirmed become liens on the property affected, and, unless paid, are collected through equitable proceedings brought by the commissioners of the road district to sell in the chancery court. C. & M. Dig. par. 5437\n\n\n This review shows that the proceedings for the making of this road improvement are in the main legislative and administrative. There is, however, one step in them that fulfills the definition of a judicial inquiry, if made by a court. That is the determination of the issue between \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n the road district on the one part and the landowners on the other, as to the respective benefits which the improvement confers on their lands, and the damages they each suffer from rights of way taken and other injury.\n The distinction between a proceeding which is the exercise of legislative power and of administrative character and a judicial suit is not always clear. An administrative proceeding transferred to a court usually becomes judicial, although not necessarily so. In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 225\n, 226 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 67, 69 (53 L. Ed. 150), this court said:\n'We shall assume that when, as here, a state Constitution sees fit to unite legislative and judicial powers in a single hand, there is nothing to hinder so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned. ... A judicial inquiry investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. That is its purpose and end. Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter.'\n\n The inquiry before the county court is a proceeding to declare and enforce a liability of lands and their owners as it stands on present and past facts under a law and rules already made by the Legislature and the administrative officers.\n The determination of benefits in such cases it quite like the valuation of property under condemnation proceedings.\n'The true inquiry is: What will the effect of the proposed improvement be upon the market value of the real property including the building thereon? The board may consider what the property is then fairly worth on the market and what will be the value when the improvement is made.' Kirst v. Street Imp. Dist., 86 Ark. 1, 109 S. W. 526; Rogers v. Imp. Dist., 139 Ark. 322, 213 S. W. 749.\n\n Assessments for benefits and damages are different \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 555]\n\u00a0\n in their essential characteristics from those for general taxation. Paving District v. Sisters of Mercy, 86 Ark. 109, 109 S. W. 1165, 15 Ann. Cas. 347. Though due process of law does not necessarily require judicial machinery to fix values in condemnation, still, because of the direct invasion of private right, courts will treat it as a common-law suit whenever it is brought before a court, and it becomes removable as such to the federal court. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n; Searl v. School District No. 2, \n124 U.S. 197\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 460; Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., \n196 U.S. 239\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 251. Speaking of the power of eminent domain, Mr. Justice Field, in Boom Co. v. Patterson, supra, said:\n'But, notwithstanding the right is one that appertains to sovereignty, when the sovereign power attaches conditions to its exercise, the inquiry whether the conditions have been observed is a proper matter for judicial cognizance. If that inquiry takes the form of a proceeding before the courts between parties, the owners of the land on the one side, and the company seeking the appropriation on the other, there is a controversy which is subject to the ordinary incidents of a civil suit, and its determination derogates in no respect from the sovereignty of the state.'\n\n This principle has been extended by this court to benefits set off against damages in Pacific Removal Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 5 S. Sup. St. 1113. In that case the proceeding was for widening a street running through the grounds of a railway company. Under the statute, the hearing was, first, before the mayor and a jury, who were to determine the actual damage done to each person in consequence of the taking of his property, without reference to the proposed improvement; and, second, to determine the actual benefits conferred upon the city and upon such private property. This court held that the proceeding before the mayor and common council was only a preliminary inquisition, but that the distinct and separable issues in the \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 556]\n\u00a0\n state circuit court between the city and the private owner as to the value of his property taken for the street, and the amount of benefit his remaining property received from the improvements, constituted 'a suit' which might be removed to the federal court, even though their determination might delay the state court proceedings. The case rules the one before us so far as the character of the controversy is concerned. We have the same issues here, and they are just as separable from benefits and damages of the other owners.\n The county court, in hearing this controversy, was a judicial tribunal from the time the commissioners filed the book of assessments in its clerk's office and asked its confirmation. The Constitution of 1874 of Arkansas, now in force declares in section 1, article 7, entitled the 'Judicial Department,' that--\n'The judicial power of the state shall be vested in one Supreme Court, in circuit courts, in county and probate courts and in justices of the peace.'\n\n Section 28 of the same article provides that--\n'The county courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all matters relating to county taxes, roads, bridges, ferries, paupers, bastardy, vagrants, the apprenticeship of minors, the disbursement of money for county purposes, and in every other case that may be necessary to the internal improvement and local concerns of the respective counties. The county court shall be held by one judge, except in cases otherwise herein provided.'\n\n The exclusive jurisdiction of the county court, conferred by section 28, concerns matters which are primarily of an administrative character, but which often involve judicial inquiry and action inter partes. The county court may act therein as an administrative body or as a court. The Supreme Court of Arkansas has held the county court to be a court, and capable of rendering judgment in a \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 557]\n\u00a0\n proceeding whose judicial character is much more questionable than here. In Nevada v. Hicks, 50 Ark. 416, 8 S. W. 180, it decided that every allowance of a claim by the county court against the county was a judicial order. See Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 532\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 695; Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co., \n133 U.S. 473\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 399.\n C. & M. Dig.  5424, quoted above in the margin, directs that, after the hearing, the county court shall make its findings, either confirming the assessments of benefits and damages, increasing or diminishing them, and that the order made by the county court shall have 'all the force and effect of a judgment against all real property in said district and it shall be deemed final, conclusive, binding and incontestable except by direct attack on appeal.' The form of the order of the county court in this case, made after removal, was:\n'It is further considered, ordered, and adjudged by the court that the assessment of benefits made against the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company ... by the assessors for said district be approved and confirmed by the court.'\n\n Of course, the statutory designation of the action of a body as a judgment, or the phrasing of its finding and conclusion in the usual formula of a judicial order, is not conclusive of the character in which it is acting. When we find, however, that the proceeding before it has all the elements of a judicial controversy (Gaines v. Fuentes, \n92 U.S. 10\n, 20), to wit, adversary parties and an issue in which the claim of one of the parties against the other, capable of pecuniary estimation, is stated and answered in some form of pleading, and is to be determined, we must conclude that this constitutional court is functioning as such.\n But it is said that the state Supreme Court has held otherwise and that such a decision is binding on us. The question of removal under the federal statute is one for the consideration of the federal court. It is not concluded \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 558]\n\u00a0\n by the view of a state court as to what is a suit within the statute. Upshur County v. Rich, \n135 \nU.S. 467, 477\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 651; Mason City R. R. Co. v. Boynton, \n204 U.S. 570\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 321; Madisonville Traction Co. v. Mining Co., \n196 U.S. 239\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 251. While the decision of the state court as to the nature of a proceeding under state statutes sought to be removed is, of course, very persuasive, it is not controlling, because involved in the application of a federal statute and the exercise of a federal constitutional right. The issue as to removal is akin to the question, which sometimes arises in enforcing the inhibition against state laws impairing the obligation of a contract, whether there is a contract under state law. This court decides that for itself. University v. People, \n99 U.S. 309\n; Jefferson Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436; Bridge Proprietors v. Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 116; Delmas v. Merchants' Ins. Co., 14 Wall. 661.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, relied on, is Mo. Pacific R. R. Co. v. Izard Co. Imp. Dist. No. 1, 143 Ark. 261, 220 S. W. 452, in which it was held that a proceeding like the one before us in the county court could not be removed to the federal court, because 'the duties which this statute devolves upon the county court, as already stated, are administrative and not judicial, although the line of demarcation is very close.'\n The court further said:\n'It will be observed that the power conferred by our statute upon the county court is not to determine whether there should be any assessment, but to equalize and adjust the assessment that has been made by the commissioners. There is nothing in the nature of an adversary proceeding, inter parties, in the assessment made by the commissioners and equalized and adjusted by the county court under the authority of the statute.'\n\n Our examination of the question leads us to a different conclusion. The book of assessments made by the assessors, \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 559]\n\u00a0\n as already noted, is presented by the commissioners of the district as an independent body, representing a fully equipped municipal corporation, capable of contracting, and of suing and being sued, to the county court. They are plaintiffs and petitioners, asking the court to give them a judgment confirming the assessments. The court's record in this case shows them present in person and by counsel, praying confirmation.\n The statute does not define how the hearing before the county court is to be conducted, except that the objections of the landowners are to be in writing, as the book of assessment is. These two documents make the pleadings. It is to be inferred, in the absence of any restriction, that oral evidence is to be heard on the issues raised by the objections, and that the commissioners in person or by attorney may take part in the hearing. Indeed, it was admitted by counsel at the hearing that this is the practice. The proceeding is said to be only equalization; but we have already seen that each lot is to be separately considered as to benefits and damages, on appeal. If so, why not on removal? We conclude that the proceeding is adversary and inter partes.\n The state court really decides that the issue as to the correctness of assessments of benefits and damages is always legislative and administrative. It relies chiefly on two federal authorities, Upshur v. Rich, \n135 U.S. 467\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 651, and In re City of Chicago (C. C.) 64 Fed. 897. In the former, the county assessors of a county in West Virginia had valued for general taxation a large tract of wild land at a figure its owners deemed excessive. They filed a petition in the county court asking a reduction, and immediately filed another petition for removal of the proceeding to the federal court on the ground of diverse citizenship. This court held, on appeal from the Circuit Court, which had denied a motion to remand, that the removal could not be sustained. It said that such assessment of a \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 560]\n\u00a0\n general tax was an administrative act, that the county court in considering the appeal from the assessors was not a court, and that the proceeding was not adversary or a suit, 'though approaching very near the line of demarcation.' \n135 U.S. 472\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 653. The county court in West Virginia had no judicial jurisdiction under the Constitution of the state, except that of probate. It had had in the past other judicial jurisdiction, but an amendment of the Constitution had taken this away, and it was empowered only to exercise duties 'not of a judicial nature.'\n Mr. Justice Bradley, who spoke for the court in the Pacific Removal Cases, supra, also delivered the opinion in the Upshur Case and summed up the conclusion as follows:\n'The principle to be deduced from these cases is that a proceeding, not in a court of justice, but carried on by executive officers in the exercise of their proper functions, as in the valuation of property for the just distribution of taxes or assessments, is purely administrative in its character, and can not, in any just sense, be called a suit; and that an appeal in such a case, to a board of assessors or commissioners having no judicial powers, and only authorized to determine questions of quantity, proportion and value, is not a suit; but that such an appeal may become a suit, if made to a court or tribunal having power to determine questions of law and fact, either with or without a jury, and there are parties litigant to contest the case on the one side and the other.'\n\n The manifest distinctions between the Upshur Case and this are, first, that the question here is not one of general taxation, the difference between which and assessments for benefits and damages we have already pointed out; second, that the county court of Arkansas, differing from the West Virginia county court, is a court, and by the Constitution of the state may exercise judicial \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 561]\n\u00a0\n functions in such subjects-matter; and, third, that the proceeding is inter partes.\n The other federal case upon which the state Supreme Court relies, In re Chicago, supra, was a decision of the Circuit Court in a sewer assessment case involving the fixing of benefits which were to be equalized over a district which the assessors found to be fair. The court held it could not be removed from the county court, first, because such an assessment was a mere administrative act, an exercise of the taxing power; and, second, because the benefits could only be fixed with reference to the benefits to all other lots, and the whole case must be removed, if removed at all. The court with difficulty distinguished the Pacific Removal Case on the ground that that was a separate investigation as to each lot and that it was mingled with the fixing of damages. These are features which distinguish this proceeding also. Moreover, the case has been criticized and its authority shaken. In re Stutsman (C. C.) 88 Fed. 337, 341; In re Jarnecke Ditch (C. C.) 69 Fed. 161; Drainage Dist. v. Chic ., M. & St. Paul (D. C.) 198 Fed. 253, 260.\n The next objection is that the road district commissioners could not file their assessment book in the federal court, assuming the necessary diverse citizenship against any lot or lot owner, and so that the inquiry cannot be removed, because, under section 28 of the Judicial Code, removal is limited to cases within the original jurisdiction of the District Court under section 24 (Comp. St.  991). This limitation is not intended to exclude from the right of removal defendants in cases in the state court which, because of their peculiar form would be awkward as an original suit in a federal court, or would require therein a reframing of the complaint and different procedure. Sheffield Furnace Co. v. Witherow, \n149 \nU.S. 574, 579\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 936; Fleitas v. Richardson, No. 1, \n147 \nU.S. 538, 544\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 429. The limitation is that only those \n\n[257 U.S. 547, 562]\n\u00a0\n proceedings can be removed which have the same essentials as original suits permissible in District Courts; that is that they can be readily assimilated to suits at common law or equity, and that there must be diverse citizenship of the parties and the requisite pecuniary amount involved. In re Stutsman County (C. C.) 88 Fed. 337; Madison Traction Co. v. Mining Co., \n196 \nU.S. 239, 246\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 251; Searl v. School District No. 2, \n124 U.S. 197\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 460; Colorado Midland Ry. Co. v. Jones (C. C.) 29 Fed. 193.\n It is finally contended that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, because it withdrew the case from the jury and then proceeded to make findings. No objection was taken by either party to this course and no exception was taken. Section 649, R. S. (Comp. St.  1587), provides that a civil case in the District Court may be tried without the intervention of a jury on a written stipulation of the parties or their attorneys filed with the clerk, in which case the finding of the court on the facts, either general or special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury, and by section 700, R. S. (Comp. St.  1668), bills of exceptions may bring such findings before the Circuit Court of Appeals for review on the evidence. But, if there be no written stipulation of waiver of a jury, then no questions can arise on writ of error, except those which arise on the process, pleadings or judgment. Bond v. Dustin, \n112 U.S. 604\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 296; Ladd & Tilton Bk. v. Hicks Co., 218 Fed. 310, 134 C. C. A. 106; Ford v. United States, 260 Fed. 657, 171 C. C. A. 421. The Circuit Court of Appeals, therefore, rightly held that no error could be predicated on the action of the District Judge in withdrawing the case from the jury and making findings, without objection or exception by the parties.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] C. & M.

U S(1922)\nNo. 64\nArgued: October 16, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. E. Russell, of New York City, and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ryan, the claimant and appellant, by his amended petition in the Court of Claims, sought to recover from the United States $3,465, being $1 per diem from April 16, 1910, to and including October 10, 1919. He was during that period a customs inspector at New York, and received $4 per day. He says that by law he was entitled to $5 per day, and he brings suit to recover the difference. The Court of Claims gave judgment for the government. The question for our decision is what was \n\n[260 U.S. 90, 91]\n\u00a0\n Ryan's lawful compensation during this period of 9 1\/2 years.\n Ryan entered the customs service as a probationary junior clerk, class C, in 1899, after passing a civil service examination. He was promoted from one place to another in the service until as the result of a promotion examination he became inspector class 2 at $4 a day, and executed an oath as such on April 16, 1910. This appointment was made in pursuance of authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the collector at New York to appoint three inspectors of customs at $4 a day, class 2. By the same authority 22 more inspectors of the same class were appointed before July 1, 1910. On that day, the collector at New York, with the approval of the Secretary, effected a reorganization by which 72 inspectors were appointed to class 2 at $4 a day, 396 to class 4 at $5 per day, and 52 to class 5 at $6 per day. The appointment of the claimant and others in April, 1910, as inspectors of class 2, $4 per day, marked their entrance into the service, and they were not reappointed under the reorganization, but remained as inspectors of class 2 under their original appointments.\n Was this appointment of Ryan at $4 a day authorized by law? Section 2733, R. S., provides that each inspector of customs shall receive for every day he shall be actually employed in aid of customs $3. Section 2737 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may increase the compensation of inspectors of customs in such ports as he may think it advisable so to do, and may designate, by adding to the present compensation of such officers, a sum not exceeding $1 a day. By Act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 429), the Secretary was given authority to appoint inspectors of customs at a compensation less than $3 per day when in his judgment the public service would permit. There is certainly nothing in the foregoing provisions, still in force, which prevented \n\n[260 U.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary from appointing inspectors in New York at $4 a day. By virtue of this authority, before 1902, he had increased the pay of all inspectors at New York to $4.\n By Act of December 16, 1902 (32 Stat. 753), the Secretary was authorized to increase the compensation of inspectors of customs at the port of New York as he might think advisable and proper by adding to their then compensation a sum not exceeding $1 per day, such additional compensation to be for work performed at unusual hours for which no compensation was then allowed, and as reimbursement of expenses for meals and transportation while in the performance of official duties. Under the foregoing, in 1903, the Secretary increased the pay of inspectors then in office in New York to $5 per day, class 4. The act of 1902 is wholly permissive in its language. It does not require an increase of $1 a day, or any part of it, to inspectors in New York. It only authorizes it.\n It is contended, however, that the act of 1902 has been construed by Congress in two deficiency appropriation acts to be mandatory, and to require that all inspectors appointed in New York shall receive $5 a day. The acts relied on are that of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 634, 636), and that of March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. 1371, 1373). In substantially the same language they appropriated money to pay inspectors of the port of New York 'the difference between the per diem salary of $4.00 per diem paid them during the months of October, November and December, 1905, and their proper salary for the same period ($5.00 per diem) in accordance with the act of Congress, approved December 16, 1902.' These deficiency appropriations related to 331 inspectors at New York whose pay had been fixed at $5 a day under the act of 1902, prior to October 1, 1905, and which on that \n\n[260 U.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n date was reduced by the Secretary of the Treasury to $4. On January 1, 1906, their pay was increased again to $5.\n It would be straining provisions of a deficiency act applying to special instances to hold that it was intended to change a plainly permissive statute into a mandatory one. The much more natural interpretation of the language used is that Congress thought that the pay of these inspectors which had been increased to $5 a day under the act of 1902 by the Secretary, had thus become fixed by law, and so that the Secretary had no power to reduce them. This fully satisfies the words relied on, without amending the statute or making it mean what it plainly does not mean.\n Counsel for appellant presses upon the court also, its decision in Cochnower v. United States, \n248 U.S. 405\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 137, as a basis for recovery here. In that case, the claimant, a customs inspector in New York, had been, with all his fellows, advanced to $5 a day (class 4), under the act of 1902. The Secretary had, thereafter, reduced him and his fellows to $4 a day (class 2), and counsel for the government asserted authority to do this under the act of 1909 (35 Stat. 1065), by which the Secretary was empowered to 'increase and fix the compensation of inspectors of customs as he might think advisable, not to exceed in any case $6.00 per diem.' The court held that authority to increase did not give authority to decrease, and that as the pay of the inspectors in that case had been fixed at $5, it was the legal pay and they could recover the balance due. The court took the same view which before the act of 1909 Congress seemed to have taken in the deficiency acts we have just discussed. Neither the language of Congress in the deficiency acts nor the Cochnower Case has any application to the one before us, because here the claimant entered the service as a new appointee at $4 a day \n\n[260 U.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n (class 2), which, as we have seen, the Secretary had full authority to fix, and his pay was not increased during the period for which he seeks recovery.\n This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider any other question in the record.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANTA FE PAC R. CO. v. PAYNE(1922)\nNo. 108\nArgued: January 24, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Francis W. Clements, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for appellee. \n\n[259 U.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two bills in equity brought in respect of different parcels of land but seeking the same kind of relief against the Secretary of the Interior, and raising the same question of law. The facts are simple. Under the land grant to its predecessor, the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company was the owner of coal lands in New Mexico. By the Act of April 28, 1904, c. 1810,  1, 33 Stat. 556, the first named road and its successors 'may, when requested by the Secretary of the Interior so to do, relinquish or deed, as may be proper, to the United States,' any sections of their land grant in New Mexico any portion of which was and had been occupied by a settler as a homestead for not less than 25 years, 'and shall then be entitled to select in lieu thereof, and to have patented other sections of vacant public land of equal uqality in said Territory, as may be agreed upon with the Secretary of the Interior.' Under this Act at the request of the Secretary of the Interior the Railroad Company relinquished specified tracts of coal land, and on May 1, 1911, selected other tracts also of coal land. After the selections questions were raised as to the value of the selected lands, and ultimately after some years, the selections were rejected on the ground of the greater value of the latter lands as shown by investigations since the choice. Thereupon the Railroad Company brought these bills to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior from cancelling its selections and from taking further action except to issue patents to the Company for the selected lands. The bills were dismissed on motion by the Courts below. 50 App. D. C. 95, 267 Fed. 653.\n The Government argues that there was no jurisdiction over the bills because the question whether the lands selected were of the same quality as those relinquished rested wholly in the judgment of the Secretary. But the \n\n[259 U.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n position of the Railroad Company is that the Secretary went beyond the powers conferred upon him by the statute when he took into account facts not known at the time of the selection, and we are of opinion that the Company is entitled to bring that question into court.\n We are of opinion also that the Company's position is right. At first sight the words of the statute entitling the Company to have patented other sections of equal quality 'as may be agreed upon with the Secretary of the Interior' might be taken to sustain the decision below, but upon consideration they seem to us not to have that effect. The moment that lands were relinquished at the request of the Secretary a contract was made and the Government was bound to convey to the Company such vacant lands within the Territory as the Company should select provided only that they were of equal quality. In theory of law the obligation was immediate when the selection was made, if it complied with the condition. It is true that the Secretary had to be satisfied upon that point, but his discretion was not arbitrary; it went only to the quality of the lands. If, as Chief Justice Shaw put it, a piepoudre Court could have been summoned and the matter determined forthwith, the Secretary would have been bound to act on the facts as they then appeared and could not have elected to wait for better days. At that time, May 1, 1911, the only relevant classification in the statutes, we believe, was of coal lands within 15 miles of a railroad, valued at not less than $20 per acre, and those more than 15 miles from one, valued at not less than $10 per acre. Rev. Stats.  2347 ( Comp. St.  4659). The Department through the Geological Survey had classified further and had valued the products in all the lands concerned at not less than $20 per acre. These were all the elements for decision when the selection was made and if the Secretary had been required to proceed at once, as the statute evidently contemplated \n\n[259 U.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n that he would, section 2, he would have been bound to agree to the Company's choice. Indeed in the first case he did agree to it, and did not attempt to revoke his decision until more than two years later on the ground of subsequently discovered facts. It is established in the parallel cases of Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 U.S. 228\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 314; Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 U.S. 367\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 333, and Wyoming v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 489, 496\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 393, that the validity of the selection must be determined according to the conditions existing at the time when it was made. These decisions were later than that in the Court below and show without the need of further argument that the decrees must be reversed.\n Decrees reversed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHAFF v. J C FAMECHON CO(1922)\nNo. 91\nArgued: January 16, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. W. Bunn, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles Burke Elliott, of Minneapolis, Minn., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, as receiver of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, suit against J. C. Famechon Company brought suit against J. C. Famechon Company in the municipal court of the city of Minneapolis to recover for charges for rental of refrigerator \n\n[258 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n cars used in shipping potatoes in 1914 and 1915 from various points in Minnesota over connecting lines to points in Oklahoma and Texas. The initial carriers were the Northern Pacific and Great Norhern Railways, and the terminal carrier the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, for which plaintiff in error was receiver. The terminal carrier received the potatoes, delivered them at their destinations, and collected from the shipper in excess of the regular line haul rate the sum of $5 for the use of each refrigerator car in four shipments in 1915. Upon one refrigerator car, shipped in 1914, the excess was not collected. Famechon Company made claim against the railway company for an overcharge of $5 on each of the four shipments so made in 1915. The railway company refunded $20 to Famechon Company, for which sum the receiver brought suit, claiming the refund was made by mistake and through a misunderstanding of the tariff and schedles; he also brought suit to recover $5 rental for the refrigerator car shipped in 1914\n\n\n Famechon Company, in its answer, put in issue the allegations of the complaint, and pleaded a counterclaim for the rental paid on two cars shipped in 1916. In the municipal court of Minneapolis defendant in error had judgment for $10, with interest and costs, and the receiver for the railway company appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota, which affirmed the judgment, 145 Minn. 108, 176 N. W. 197. A writ of error was allowed bringing the case to this court.\n From the facts found by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and shown by evidence and stipulation, it appears that the established freight rate on potatoes in carloads from points of origin to points of desination, named in the pleadings, was contained in tariffs known as 'Southwestern Lines' Tariffs.' These tariffs were subject to the 'Southwestern Lines' Classifications, Exceptions and \n\n[258 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n Rules Circulars.' Neither such circular nor the Southwestern Lines' Tariffs was on file or published at any of the stations of origin of shipment, but they were on file in certain designated offices of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and at various points in other states. At the time the shipments were made Western Trunk Line Circular No. 12, specifically referred to in Southwestern Lines' Classifications, Exceptions and Rules, was on file at the points of origin of shipment and destination; and it was the only tariff issued by any of the carriers participating in the transportation of the shipments in question which contained a $5 rental provision for refrigerator cars; that circular was printed and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and contained a rule to the effect that when the shipper ordered a refrigerator or other insulated car to be heated by him or to move without heat, a charge of $5 per car per trip would be made for use of car, which would accrue to the owner thereof.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota recited the provisions of section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 34 Stat. 586 (Comp. St.  requiring the filing of rates and charges with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the posting thereof at stations, and the rule of the Interstate Commerce Commission adopted June 2, 1908, requiring the filing of rates and schedules, and held that the additional charges could not be collected under that statute and rule because neither the Southwestern Lines' Tariffs, nor the Southwestern Lines' Classification, Exceptions and Rules Circulars making reference to Circular No. 12 were on file at the point of origin of shipment, and that there were no tariffs on file at such point to which shippers could refer to ascertain the rates of transportation.\n The case is brought here by writ of error. We are of opinion that we cannot acquire jurisdiction by that \n\n[258 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n method under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214). Counsel for plaintiff in error contends that a writ of error is the proper method of review because there was drawn in question the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, and that the effect of the state Supreme Court decision was to deny such validity. The argument is that the Interstate Commerce Act confers on carriers the right to receive the revenues defined in the tariffs, and is a command with penalties that carriers collect those revenues, and that as the decision turns on the issue directly raised, and necessarily involved, whether the tariff was or was not valid, there was drawn in question the validity of an authority exercised under the United States; that the question really decided by the Supreme Court of Minnesota was not the interpretation of the tariff, nor the extent or nature of the rights claimed under it, but the validity of a tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. But we cannot accept this contention.\n We have recently had occasion to consider the meaning of the phrase 'validity of an authority' as used in section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended September 6, 1916. Jett Brothers Distilling Co. v. City of Carrollton, \n252 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 255, and cases cited. We held that the validity of an authority was drawn in question when the power to create it is fairly open to denial, and is denied. In that case we cited with approval the same conclusion reached by this court in its opinion rendered by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in Baltimore & Potomac Railway Co. v. Hopkins, \n130 U.S. 210\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 503. We see no occasion to depart from that definition of the phrase.\n In the instant case the Supreme Court of Minnesota did not question the federal power to enact the statute as to rates with its requirements concerning the filing and posting thereof, nor the authority of the Interstate Commerce \n\n[258 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n Commission to make the rule quoted in its opinion. What the court did was to so interpret the statute and rule as to render essential the filing of the tariffs at stations at the points of origin of shipment. Such interpretation, whether right or wrong, did not involve the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, and the review in this court should have been sought by a petition for writ of certiorari.\n The writ of error must be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHWAB v. DOYLE(1922)\nNo. 200\nArgued: April 17, 1922Decided: May 1, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. F. Keeney, of Grand Rapids, Mich, and John J. Bertrees, of Nashville, Tenn., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 530]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 529, 531]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Augusta Dickel by a deed dated April 21, 1915, assigned and delivered to the Detroit Trust Company, stocks, bonds or securities of the declared value of $1,000,000, with all their unmatured coupons, and the proceeds to be derived therefrom, both principal and income, in trust to invest and reinvest and to pay the net income for life to \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 532]\n\u00a0\n Victor E. Shwab or on his written order. After his death the net income was directed to be paid to six beneficiaries, his children. A power of delegating and selling or exchanging all securities was given to Shwab, and of reinvestment. During the life of Shwab the net income was to be paid to him or his order. After his death the trust was to continue during the lives of the beneficiaries and the net income was to be paid to them during their respective lives in equal shares.\n There were other rights and powers given to plaintiff and the beneficiaries not necessary to mention.\n The trust deed was accepted by the Detroit Trust Company on or before June 3, 1915\n\n\n Augusta Dickel died September 16, 1916, possessed of an estate of $ 800,000. Seven days before her death Congress passed an act, entitled 'Estate Tax Act' (39 Stat. 777-780 [Comp. St.  6336 1\/2 a-6336 1\/2 m]). The act provided that according to certain percentages of the value of the net estate, a tax was to be imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of the act-\n'to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title. ...'\n\n Under the assumption that the act was applicable to the deed made by Augusta Dickel to the Detroit Trust Company a tax was assessed and exacted from plaintiff in error (here called plaintiff) in the sum of $56,548.41. \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 533]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff paid it under protest and then to recover it brought this action in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Michigan, Southern Division.\n A jury being impaneled to try the case, the plaintiff presented his contentions in requests for charges. These were: (1) To find for plaintiff . (2) Upon refusal of the court to so charge, but not otherwise, that the deed of Mrs. Dickel to the Detroit Trust Company took effect more than a year before the enactment of the Act of September 8, 1916; that is, took effect immediately, not in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of Mrs. Dickel. (3) The words 'in contemplation of death' do not refer to that general expectation of death which every mortal entertains, but rather the apprehension which arises from some existing condition of body or some impending peril. (4) If Mrs. Dickel, when she made the trust deed, was not in that apprehension arising from that condition of body or of an impending peril, it was not made in contemplation of death within the meaning of the act of Congress. (5) Mrs. Dickel having made the deed before the act of Congress was passed, her purpose was not to defeat or evade the federal Revenue Law.\n There were other requests for instructions to the jury not material to be considered, except that the act of Congress was not retrospective in character, and therefore did not impose a tax on the deed from Mrs. Dickel to the Trust Company, and that, if it could be considered to have that character and effect, it would be unconstitutional and void as a denial of due process of law, and the taking of private property for public use without just compensation, contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The court ruled against all of the requests so far as the court considered them as presenting questions of law, but considered that whether the trust deed was made in contemplation \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 534]\n\u00a0\n of death was a question for the jury and submitted it to them, with aiding and defining explanations, and concluded by declaring:\n'The whole question is the question whether the transfer was made in contemplation of death; that is all there is to it.'\n\n The verdict of the jury was in favor of the defendant, upon which judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals ( 269 Fed. 321), to the action of which this writ of error is directed.\n Plaintiff urges against the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals all of the contentions presented in his requests made to the District Court for instructions to the jury, but so diverse and extensive consideration is only necessary if the act of Congress be of retrospective operation. To that proposition we shall therefore address our attention.\n The initial admonition is that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage unless that intention be clearly declared. 1 Kent, 455; Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 U.S. 578\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 515; White v. United States, \n191 U.S. 545\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 171; Gould v. Gould, \n245 U.S. 151\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 53; Story, Const.  1398. The comment of Story is:\n'Retrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust, and, as has been forcibly said, neither accord with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles of the social compact.'\n\n There is absolute prohibition against them when their purpose is punitive; they then being denominated ex post facto laws. It is the sense of the situation that that which impels prohibition in such case exacts clearness of declaration when burdens are imposed upon completed and remote transactions, or consequences given to them of which there could have been no foresight or contemplation when they were designed and consummated.\n The Act of September 8, 1916, is within the condemnation. \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 535]\n\u00a0\n There is certainly in it no declaration of retroactivity, 'clear, strong, and imperative,' which is the condition expressed in United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch, 399, 413 (2 L. Ed. 479); also United States v. Burr, \n159 \nU.S. 78, 82\n, 83 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 1002.\n If the absence of such determining declaration leaves to the statute a double sense, it is the command of the cases that that which rejects retroactive operation must be selected.\n The circumstances of this case impel to such selection. If retroactivity be accepted what shall mark its limit? The Circuit Court of Appeals found the interrogation not troublesome. It said:\n'Congress would, we think, scarcely be impressed with a practical likelihood that a transfer made many years before a grantor's death ( say 25 years, to use plaintiff's suggestion) would be judicially found to be made in contemplation of death under the legal definition applicable thereto, and without the aid of the two years prima facie provision.'\n\n In other words, the sense of courts and juries, good or otherwise, might, against the words of the statute, and against what might be the evidence in the case, unhelped by the presumption declared, fix the years of its retrospect. This would seem to make the difficulty or ease of proof a substitute for the condition which the statute makes necessary to the imposition of the tax; that is, the disposition with which the transfer is made, and certainly, whether that disposition exist at an instant before death or years before death, it is a condition of the tax.\n The construction of the government is more tenable though more unrestrained. It accepted in bold consistency, at the oral argument, the challenge of 25 years, and a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in bolder confidence, extends the statute to 'transfers of any kind made in contemplation of death at any time whatsoever (italics ours) prior to September 8, 1916.' The sole test in the opinion of that officer is \n\n[258 U.S. 529, 536]\n\u00a0\n 'the date of the death of the decedent.' He fixes no period to the retrospect he declares, but reserves, if he be taken at his word, the transfers of all times to the demands of revenue. In this there is much to allure an administrative officer. Indeed, its simplicity attracts any one. It removes puzzle from construction and perplexity and pertinence on account of the distance of death from the transfer, risking no chances of courts or juries, in repugnance or revolt, taking liberties with the act to relieve from its exactions to satisfy the demands of revenue.\n If Congress, however, had the purpose assigned by the Commissioner, it should have declared it; when it had that purpose, it did declare it. In the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 c) it reenacted section 202 of the Act of September 8, 1916, and provided that the transfer or trust should be taxed, whether 'made or created before or after the passage of' the act. And we cannot accept the explanation that this was an elucidation of the act of 1916, and not an addition to it, as averred by defendant, but regard the act of 1918 rather as a declaration of a new purpose; not the explanation of an old one. But, granting the contention of the defendant has plausibility, it is to be remembered that we are dealing with a tax measure, and whatever doubts exist must be resolved against it.\n This we have seen is the declaration of the cases, and this the basis of our decision; that is, has determined our judgment against the retroactive operation of the statute. There are adverse considerations, and the government has urged them all. To enter into a detail of them, or of the cases cited to sustain them, and of those cited to oppose them, either directly or in tendency, and the examples of the states for and against them, would extend this opinion to repellent length.

The facts material at this stage can be told in a few words. The Shipping Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451; 39 Stat. 728 (Comp. St.  8146a et seq.) passed no doubt in contemplation of the possibility of war, to create a naval reserve and merchant marine, established the United States Shipping Board and gave it power to form a corporation under the laws of the District of Columbia for the purchase, construction and operation of merchant vessels-the corporation to be dissolved 'at the expiration of five years from the conclusion of the present European war.' The stock was not to exceed $50,000,000, and the Board was authorized to purchase not less than a majority of such stock. War was declared on April 6, 1917, and the corporation was formed on the 16th of the same month. \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 565]\n\u00a0\n The first case is a bill brought by the Sloan Shipyards Corporation, the Capital City Iron Works and Anacortes Shipbuilding Company. According to the allegations, on May 18, 1917, the new corporation made an elaborate contract with the Sloan Shipyards Corporation for the building by the latter of sixteen wooden vessels. At that time the Emergency Fleet Corporation had only the powers given by the incorporation laws of the District. The work was begun by the Sloan Shipyards Corporation and by the two other complainants, which were subsidary companies organized for the purpose of carrying out that contract, and went on until December 1, 1917, at which time the Fleet Corporation refused to make further payments required by the contract, unlawfully took possession of all the property of the three companies named, has retained it ever since and has done a series of acts causing them great loss. It is alleged that the defendant having thus got the Sloan Shipyards Corporation wholly within its power compelled it to execute another contract set forth. The bill seeks to have this contract set aside, to have an accounting on the footing of the original contract of May 18, to have the defendant charged with all indebtedness incurred since December 1, 1917, and required to restore the properties described in the bill. The bill was dismissed by the District Court on the ground that as the claim was for more than $10,000 the suit must be brought in the Court of Claims. 268 Fed. 624; 272 Fed. 132.\n The Shipping Act contemplated a corporation in which private persons might be stockholders and which was to be formed like any business corporation under the laws of the District, with capacity to sue and be sued. The United States took all the stock but that did not affect the legal position of the company. United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165. At that stage the original contract was made. Subsequently the powers of the corporation \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 566]\n\u00a0\n were greatly enlarged. On July 11, 1917, the President delegated to it the powers that had been conferred upon him by the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, applicable to the construction, purchase and requisitioning of vessels in process of construction and of materials for ship construction, and delegated to the Shipping Board his powers to take by purchase or requisition constructed vessels and the operation of all vessels acquired by the United States, with authority to exercise these powers either directly or through the Fleet Corporation. Whether the Fleet Corporation did or could rely upon this delegation in its alleged acts of December, 1917, or whether it purported to be acting under powers conferred upon it by the contract does not appear from the allegations of the bill. Subsequently the Fleet Corporation by successive acts and proclamations was authorized to condemn various forms of property. Act of March 1, 1918, c. 19, 40 Stat. 438; Act of April 22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535; Act of July 9, 1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 845, 888; Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020, 1026; Executive Order of December 3, 1918, delegating all powers as to ship or plant construction and ratifying previous acts. Perhaps it is enough to add a reference to the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988, 993, continuing the existence of the Fleet Corporation and its authority to operate vessels until all vessels are sold as directed by the act (section 12), but transferring the title to the Shipping Board (section 4.)\n These provisions sufficiently indicate the enormous powers ultimately given to the Fleet Corporation. They have suggested the argument that it was so far put in place of the sovereign as to share the immunity of the sovereign from suit otherwise than as the sovereign allows. But such a notion is a very dangerous departure from one of the first principles of our system of law. The soverign properly so called is superior to suit for reasons that often have been explained. But the general rule is that any \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 567]\n\u00a0\n person within the jurisdiction always is amenable to the law. If he is sued for conduct harmful to the plaintiff his only shield is a constitutional rule of law that exonerates him. Supposing the powers of the Fleet Corporation to have been given to a single man we doubt if any one would contend that the acts of Congress and the delegations of authority from the President left him any less liable than other grantees of the power of eminent domain to be called upon to defend himself in court. An instrumentality of Government he might be and for the greatest ends, but the agent, because he is agent, does not cease to be answerable for his acts. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 842, 843; United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 213\n, 221 S., 1 Sup. Ct. 240. The opposite notion left some traces in the law (1 Roll. Abr. 95, Action sur Case, T.), but for the most part long has disappeared.\n If what we have said is correct it cannot matter that the agent is a corporation rather than a single man. The meaning of incorporation is that you have a person, and as a person one that presumably is subject to the general rules of law. The only serious question is whether special remedies have been provided by statute that displace those that otherwise would be at the plaintiff's command. The Acts of April 22, 1918, c. 62,  3, 40 Stat. 535, and the Act of July 18, 1918, c. 157,  13, 40 Stat. 913, 916, give compensation for a plant taken by the President under the powers conferred by the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, and otherwise, with a resort for claims exceeding $10,000 to the Court of Claims; in the later act, by a suit against the United States. But the taking possession of the plaintiffs' plants on December 1, 1917, is alleged to have been unlawful and it cannot be assumed at this stage that the act of the Fleet Corporation was in pursuance of any powers then delegated to it or was within the ratification of December 3, 1918. The plaintiffs are not suing the United States but the Fleet Corporation, and if its act \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 568]\n\u00a0\n was unlawful, even if they might have sued the United States, they are not cut off from a remedy against the agent that did the wrongful act. In general the United States cannot be sued for a tort, but its immunity does not extend to those that acted in its name. It is not impossible that the Fleet Corporation purported to act under the contract giving it the right to take possession in certain events, but that the plaintiffs can show that the events had not occurred. The District Judge gave weight to the phrase in the general incorporation law of the District that corporations formed under it shall be capable of suing and being sued in any Court in the District. Code D. C.  607. But we do not read those words as putting District corporations upon a different footing from those formed under the laws of the states.\n We attach no importance to the fact that the second contract, alleged to have been illegally extorted, was made with the Fleet Corporation 'representing the United States of America.' The Fleet Corporation was the contractor, even if the added words had any secondary effect. But the bill alleges that it was brought about by the wrongful act of the Fleet Corporation. The conclusion that we reach is that the District Court erred in dismissing the bill and we regard it as led up to and almost required by the decisions heretofore reached in The Lake Monroe, \n250 U.S. 246\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 460, and United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165. See, further, Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163, 177\n, 178 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 507, 4 A. L. R. 1623; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 135, 152\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 502. The transfer of the property of the Fleet Corporation to the Shipping Board by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250,  4, 41 Stat. 988, 990, may affect the value of the remedy afforded by the present suit but not the jurisdiction of the Court.\n It is suggested that there will be lack of uniformity if suits can be brought in state courts. This consideration cannot control our conclusion from the statutes. But it \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 569]\n\u00a0\n is not very serious since such suits against this corporation can be removed to the Courts of the United States, Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 U.S. 1\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1113, and afterwards are subject to review here. Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 258\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 822; Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n245 U.S. 359\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 130; Id., \n248 U.S. 562\n, 38 Sup Ct. 203. The change in the law by the Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22,  5, 38 Stat. 803, 804 (Comp. St.  1233a), extends only to railroads. The decree of the District Court must be reversed.\n In the next case the Astoria Marine Iron Works sued in a state court for breach of a contract set forth. The suit was removed to the District Court and there dismissed upon demurrer on the same ground as the last- that the only remedy was in the Court of Claims. Astoria Marine Iron Works v. U. S. Shipping Board E. F. Corp., 270 Fed. 635. This contract was made on February 1, 1919, when the character of the Fleet Corporation had been more fully developed and determined than in the previous case, and purported to be made with the Fleet Corporation, 'a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the District of Columbia (herein called the 'Corporation') representing the United States of America, party of the second part.' Throughout the contract the undertakings of the party of the second part are expressed to be undertakings of the corporation and it is this corporation and its officers that are to be satisfied in regard to what is required from the Iron Works. It is recognized that it may be necessary for the United States to exercise complete control over the furnishing of supplies to the Iron Works and it is agreed that if required by the Corporation 'and\/or the United States' the Iron Works will furnish schedules, etc. The whole frame of the instrument seems to us plainly to recognize the Corporation as the immediate party to the contract. The distinction between it and the United States is marked in the phrase last quoted. If we are right in this, further reasoning seems to us unnecessary to show that there was jurisdiction \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 570]\n\u00a0\n of the suit. The fact that the corporation was formed under the general laws of the District of Columbia is persuasive, even standing alone, that it was expected to contract and to stand suit in its own person, whatever indemnities might be furnished by the United States. The judgment in this case also must be reversed.\n The third case, as we have said, is a claim of priority in bankruptcy. It was asserted against the estate of the Eastern Shore Shipbuilding Corporation, in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, under a contract similar to that last described, made by that company with the Fleet Corporation 'representing the United States of America' to construct six harbor tugs. The claim was presented by the Fleet Corporation in its own name, but was put forward by it as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States. It was denied successively by the referee, the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the Fleet Corporation was a distinct entity, and that, whatever might be the law as to a direct claim of the United States, the Fleet Corporation stood like other creditors and was not to be preferred. In re Eastern Shore Shipbuilding Corp., 274 Fed. 983. The considerations that have been stated apply even more obviously to this case. The order is affirmed.\n 308. Decree reversed.\n 376. Judgment reversed.\n 526. Order affirmed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, dissenting.\n I differ with the majority in the first two of these three cases. The question presented is one of the interpretation of the will of Congress. No one can contend that Congress in using the Fleet Corporation for its purposes might not have given it express immunity from suit as a \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 571]\n\u00a0\n representative of the United States. What we have to decide is whether in the mass of urgent legislation in respect to the government's construction and operation of shipping made indispensable by the peculiar exigencies of the great war, Congress intended that this corporate agent should be subject to suit only as its principal is. I concede that the legislation originally creating this corporation, without express immunity from suit, naturally gives rise to the inference that Congress concluded that the greater freedom of action secured by carrying on business in corporate form was desirable and that in the absence of express provision for it, and in respect to what the corporation was originally intended to do, immunity cannot be reasonably implied from the relation of the government to the corporation and its interest in its business. As I read the record, however, the transactions in the two cases I am discussing, and which we have to consider, took place after the situation prompting the creation of this corporation had greatly changed and after much additional legislation. The power to do the things which were here done, and which are the subjects of these suits, is not to be found in the act creating the Fleet Corporation or in legislation expanding its original faculties. It was power vested directly in the President himself, the exercise of which he was given express authority to delegate to an agent, who might be the Fleet Corporation. The act conferring this presidential power provided a specific remedy for compensation to those whose property rights were invaded by its exercise through award by the President and immediate payment of part due thereunder, with the right to the claimant to litigate the justice of the whole award in the Court of Claims. The Fleet Corporation in the arrangements which it forced upon the claimants in these two cases to their detriment expressly declared that it acted as a representative of the United States. I think the proper construction to be put upon \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 572]\n\u00a0\n the facts and the law is that these suits are in fact against the United States and cannot be brought except in the manner and under the procedure provided by the statute for claims for compensation for acts done by authority of the President under the act vesting him with it.\n The opinion of the Court is carefully drawn and if its conclusion is to rest merely on the nice distinction that it does not clearly appear from a proper construction of the pleadings that the acts here complained of were acts done under authority delegated by the President to the Fleet Corporation, as his agent, then the question I have been discussing and which seems to me to be in these cases is not here decided, and will only arise on answer and evidence.\n I do not think that either the case of The Lake Monroe, \n250 U.S. 246\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 460, or that of United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165, requires the conclusion reached herein by the majority of the Court, and, indeed, their opinion is not clear and unqualified in reference to the effect of those cases.\n I should not think it necessary to record a difference with my brethren of the majority but for considerations of high public expediency which may properly weigh with us in construing a doubtful statute of Congress because they must have been in the mind of Congress in the enactment of the legislation. We are made aware of the very great number of suits pending and likely to arise out of the work of the Fleet Corporation and the enormous total involved in them. This was to be expected. Can Congress be supposed to have intended that these suits might be brought in 48 different states and in courts of first instance of those states with the lack of uniformity in the findings of fact and the conclusions of law likely to be encountered where trials are had by courts and by courts and juries in so many varying jurisdiction? Did it propose to allow the United States to be made liable in litigation anywhere or under any form of procedure \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 573]\n\u00a0\n without any regulation on its part to secure a reasonable limitation of its own as to the time within which such suits shall be brought? The Court suggests that judgments thus obtained will be good only against the Fleet Corporation and the claimants must run the risk of getting a judgment against a debtor which cannot pay. Congress has taken over all the assets of the Fleet Corporation so that such judgments will be valueless except as Congress shall conclude to pay them. If, in the judgments obtained in the various courts of the country Congress shall find such variety of view as not to commend them to its sense of fairness, it will be slow to recognize its obligation to pay them, and we shall have a repetition of the history of the French spoliation claims which for many decades occupied the attention of appropriation committees of Congress and wore out their patience with results that have put in the hearts of claimants a deep sense of the injustice of governments. On the other hand, a construction which will bring into one tribunal, the Court of Claims, the hearing and decision of this class of cases, will secure uniformity and dispatch and these two elements will make for justice and peace, because Congress pays the judgments of the Court of Claims against the United States in due course. The result reached by the Court if it is to go as far as I fear it must, even with the careful limitation of the language of the judgment, will make the existing confusion as to the claims against the Fleet Corporation worse confounded. It is to be hoped that if the ultimate view of the Court of the effect of the statutes under discussion is to spread this litigation all over the country with ineffective and doubtful results dependent on future approval of Congress, that Congress itself may by further remedial legislation avoid such an undesirable condition, unfavorable both to the United States and the litigants. \n\n[258 U.S. 549, 574]\n\u00a0\n As to the preference claimed against a bankrupt in No. 526 by the Fleet Corporation, I concur in the conclusion of the Court that it can not be allowed under the statute as to preferences in bankruptcy because I do not think it extends to claims of the United States except those for taxes.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in these views. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMIETANKA v. FIRST TRUST & SAV BANK(1922)\nNo. 540\nArgued: January 19, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 602, 603]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for petitioner.\n Mr. John P. Wilson, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented for decision is whether, under the Income Tax Law of 1913, income held and accumulated by a trustee for the benefit of unborn and unascertained persons was taxable. The accumulations of income were $789,905.65 for the years 1913, 1914, and 1915, and the tax collected by the petitioner as collector, and paid under protest by the trustee, the respondent, amounted to $36,638.69. Respondent brought suit for this sum against the petitioner in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and judgment was rendered against it on demurrer to the declaration. The \n\n[257 U.S. 602, 604]\n\u00a0\n judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. First Trust & Savings Bank v. Smietanka, 268 Fed. 230. The District Court then overruled the demurrer and, the petitioner electing not to plead further, rendered a judgment against him, which was affirmed by the court below on a second appeal. As this case arises under the revenue laws and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is final (section 128 of the Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1120]), certiorari issued under section 240 of the Code (Comp. St.  1217).\n The income tax here in question was provided for in 'an act to reduce tariff duties and to provide revenue for the government and for other purposes,' enacted October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. 114), and is embodied in section II of that act (page 166 et seq.). The tax is imposed by paragraph A, subd. 1. It levies a normal tax of 1 per cent. upon the entire yearly net income arising from all sources accruing to every citizen of the United States and to every person in the United States residing there. In subdivision 2, an additional or surtax is levied on the net income of every individual. Under paragraph G, the normal tax imposed on individuals is extended to corporations. Paragraph B defines the net income of individuals and specifies the deductions. Paragraph D makes provision for returns by persons and then says:\n'Guardians, trustees, executors, administrators, agents, receivers, conservators, and all persons, ... or associations acting in a fiduciary capacity, shall make and render a return of the net income of the person for whom they act, subject to this tax, coming into their custody or control and management, and be subject to all the provisions of this section which apply to individuals.'\n\n Paragraph E provides that, among others, all lessees or mortgagors of real or personal property, trustees acting in any trust capacity, executors, administrators, agents, receivers, conservators, having control, receipt, custody, disposal or payment of annual gains, profits and income \n\n[257 U.S. 602, 605]\n\u00a0\n of another person, exceeding $3,000 for any taxable year, who are required to make return in behalf of another, shall deduct the normal tax on the income and pay it to the United States, and they are each made personally liable for such tax. It is further declared that these payments of the tax at the source shall only apply to the normal tax thereinbefore imposed on individuals.\n It is obvious from a reading of the statute, the relevant provisions of which we have summarized, that Congress was seeking to require fiduciaries to make return and pay the normal tax due from persons subject to the tax on such income as the fiduciaries were receiving for such persons. There was nowhere in the act a payment required of the fiduciary of a tax upon the income of the estate or trust property, the income from which he collects, except as it is to inure to the benefit of a person or an individual from whose income he is authorized and required to deduct the normal tax thereon. There must have been a taxable person for whom the fiduciary was acting to make the provisions relied upon by the government applicable. There was no provision for the payment 'at the source' by the fiduciary of anything but the normal tax. It was intended that the additional or surtax should be paid by the cestui que trust. Here there was no cestui que trust to pay a surtax.\n No language in the act included a tax on income received by a trustee by him to be accumulated for unborn or unascertained beneticiaries. There was indicated in the taxing paragraph A the congressional intention to tax citizens everywhere, and noncitizens, resident in the United States, including persons, natural and corporate, on incom from every source less allowed deductions. But nowhere were words used which can be stretched to include unborn beneficiaries for whom income may be accumulating. It may be that Congress had a general \n\n[257 U.S. 602, 606]\n\u00a0\n intention to tax all incomes whether for the benefit of persons living or unborn, but a general intention of this kind must be carried into language which can be reasonably construed to effect it. Otherwise the intention cannot be enforced by the courts. The provisions of such acts are not to be extended by implication. Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 267\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 611; United States v. Field, \n255 U.S. 257\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 256; Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 53.\n The Treasury Department did not attempt, for two years, to collect tax on income of this character. This was in accord with the ruling of Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue Speer, dated February 9, 1915, published by the Department (Corporation Trust Co. Income Tax service 1915, p. 426). He held that--\n'The income tax can be levied only on such income as is payable to some natural or artificial person subject to the provisions of the law.'\n\n Subsequently this ruling was changed and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that--\n'when the beneficiary is not in esse and the income of the estate is retained by the fiduciary, such income will be taxable to the estate as for an individual, and the fiduciary will pay the tax both normal and additional.'\n\n This seems to us to graft something on the statute that is not there. It is an amendment, and not a construction, and such an amendment was made in subsequent income tax laws as we shall see.\n Counsel for the government cite the case of Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. V. Smietanka, \n255 U.S. 509\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305, to support their contention. It does not do so because it deals with an amendment of the provision here under discussion. The issue there was the legality of an income tax levied against a trustee for income received by him under a testamentary trust to pay the net income to the widow for life and afterwards to the children. \n\n[257 U.S. 602, 607]\n\u00a0\n It was held that the trustee was a taxable person under the Act of October 2, 1917, 40 Stat. 331 (Comp. St. 1918,  6336h), which required trustees to render a return of the income for the person, trust or estate for whom or which they act.\n The Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 757 (Comp. St. 1918,  6336b) specifically declared that the income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons should be taxed and assessed to the trustee. It is obvious that in the acts subsequent to that of 1913, Congress sought to make specific provision for the casus omissus in the earlier act.\n This case is not unlike that of United States v. Field, \n255 U.S. 257\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 256. The Revenue Act of 1916 imposed a tax on the estate of a decedent at the time of his death. The government sought to tax property passing under a decedent's testamentary execution of a general power of appointment. It was held that while in equity property passing under such a power might be treated as assets of the donee for the use of his creditors if executed in favor of a volunteer, it was not subject to distribution as part of the estate of the donee and was not taxable. In the latter act, such property was expressly included. This was thought by the court to show at least a legislative doubt whether the earlier act included such property. This court said (\n255 U.S. 264\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 256) that it would have been easy for Congress to express a purpose to tax such property but it had not done so. In the Act of 1913, it would have been easy to require a trustee to pay an income tax on income received by him for unborn beneficiaries or for the trust or the estate. But Congress did not do so. In the next act, it did so.

The cause comes here by direct appeal, and only the question of jurisdiction is before us.\n Where, as here, the jurisdiction of a District Court has been invoked on the sole ground that the cause involves a federal question, and this is duly challenged, the issue must be determined by considering the allegations of the bill. If they distinctly disclose a real, substantial question of that nature, there is jurisdiction; otherwise there is none. City Ry. Co. v. Citizens' St. R. Co., \n166 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 17 S. Sup.

The bill did not, therefore, present a substantial federal question, and for that reason jurisdiction did not exist.\n Here it is affirmatively alleged that the city intends forcibly to remove and destroy appellants' property and thereby violate their constitutional rights.

OLYMPIAN DREDGING CO(1922)\nNo. 78\nArgued: October 19, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. R. Harr, of Washington, D. C., and E. J. Foulds and Elmer Westlake, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners. \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas E. Haven, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1895 the California Pacific Railroad Company, one of the petitioners, was authorized by the Legislature of the state of California to construct, and did construct, a railroad bridge across the Sacramento river. For some years prior to that time this company had owned and both petitioners had used another bridge situated in the near vicinity. Upon the construction of the new bridge in 1895 the old bridge was abandoned and demolished. The plans and location of the new bridge, so authorized by the Legislature, received the formal approval of the Secretary of War, in conformity with section 7 of the Act of September 19, 1890 (26 Stat. 454), as amended by section 3 of the Act of Congress of July 13, 1892 (27 Stat. 110), subject to the following condition:\n'That said railway company, within 90 days after the completion of the new bridge, shall remove every portion of the present existing bridge, the old piers to be removed from the bed of the river to a depth of seven (7) feet below the level of the lowest low water, being a reading of 7.5 feet on the K street gauge, Sacramento, California.'\n\n The new bridge was finished in 1895 and the destruction of the old bridge was completed early in the following year. The condition imposed by the Secretary of War was fully complied with. Indeed it appears that the piles constituting the piers of the old bridge were cut down 3 or 4 feet lower than was required, to a level with or below the then existing bed of the river.\n Subsequent to the removal of the piles the government of the United States constructed a wing dam above and \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n carried on dredging operations immediately below the bridge, so that the bed of the river was gradually lowered until, in 1918, when the injury in question occurred, the surface of the water was about 7 feet lower than at the time the piles were destroyed, although the depth of the water remained approximately the same with the result that the old stumps protruded several feet above the then existing bed of the river.\n There is nothing to indicate that either of the petitioners had actual knowledge of the changed conditions which brought about the protrusion of the old piles above the bed of the river, or any knowledge that these piles were a menace to navigation.\n On July 13, 1918, the dredger Thor, owned by respondent, on her way down the river, drifting with the current, struck on one or more protruding stumps, the upper portion of which had been destroyed, with the result that her hull was pierced and she sank.\n The respondent filed a libel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against petitioners, asking damages for collision, and, after hearing that court dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, held that petitioners were liable for this injury, notwithstanding their full compliance with the condition imposed by the Secretary of War, upon the ground that it was reasonably probable in 1895 that the channel of the river would shift and the conditions ensue which brought about the lowering of the river bed, and that, consequently, it was their duty to anticipate and to guard against the effect of these conditions upon the piles and their failure to do so was actionable negligence.\n We are unable to agree with this conclusion. By the Act of September, 1890 (26 Stat. 453, 454), Congress inaugurated a new policy of general, direct control over the navigable waters of the United States. The act provided \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n for the alteration of existing bridges which interfered with free navigation (sections 4 and 5); prohibited the dumping of waste material in such waters so as to obstruct navigation (section 6); made it unlawful to build wharves, piers, and other structures named, without the permission of the Secretary of War, in such manner as to obstruct or impair navigation; or to commence the construction of any bridge over any such waters under any act of a state Legislature until the location and plans therefore had been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of War; or to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition or capacity of the channel of said navigable water of the United States, unless approved and authorized by the Secretary of War ( section 7). The amendment of 1892 did not alter section 7 in any respect material to this inquiry.\n By this legislation Congress assumed jurisdiction of the subject of obstructions to navigation and committed to the Secretary of War administrative power in so far as administration was necessary. Under section 7, it was not enough for the California Pacific Railroad Company to secure the authority of the California Legislature to build the new bridge; it was necessary in addition to have the location and plans approved by the Secretary of War before the bridge could be lawfully constructed. That the Secretary of War was authorized to impose the condition heretofore quoted does not admit of doubt. The power to approve implies the power to disapprove and the power to disapprove necessarily includes the lesser power to condition an approval. In the light of this general assumption by Congress of control over the subject and of the large powers delegated to the Secretary, the condition imposed by that officer cannot be considered otherwise than as an authoritative determination of what was reasonably necessary to be done to insure free and safe navigation so far as the obstruction in question was concerned. \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 209]\n\u00a0\n To hold, as did the Circuit Court of Appeals, that this determination afforded no protection to petitioners, but that they relied upon it only at their peril, we think is a conclusion without warrant. Having complied with the direction of the Secretary, and having no further interest in anything at that point on the river, it seems altogether unreasonable to hold them to an indefinite and speculative responsibility for future changed conditions. The piles had been removed early in 1896, with an overgenerous observance of the directions of the Secretary. As matters then stood, the removal of the piles, so far as they constituted any obstruction or menace to navigation was complete; that they afterwards became an obstruction was due to changes of a most radical character in the channel of the river, brought about, in the main, by the dredging operations of the government itself. Was the petitioner guilty of negligence in not anticipating the effect of these changes, which did not culminate in the conditions complained of until 22 years later? The question must be answered in the negative.\n The order of the Secretary of War, directing the removal of the old piles from the bed of the river to the depth there specified was a valid order, since it was the condition upon which his approval of the location and plans of the new bridge was made. The new bridge was in the near vicinity of the old bridge, for which it was, in fact, a substitute. The effect which the continued maintenance of the latter after the completion of the former might have had upon the navigability of the river at that point is not disclosed. The Secretary of War evidently concluded that the situation was such as to require the removal of the old bridge and piles, but not such as to require the removal of the latter beyond the depth fixed by his order. Whether the limitation in this respect was grounded alone upon what the Secretary considered would be sufficient to secure the safety of navigation, or upon the \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n fact that to leave the stumps in the bed of the river would be of some positive service in stabilizing the shifting bed of the stream, or useful in some other way, does not appear. It was not for the petitioners, however, to question either his reasons or his conclusions. They were justified in proceeding upon the assumption that what the Secretary, in the exercise of his lawful powers, declared to be no obstruction to navigation was in fact no obstruction. The language which this Court employed in Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177, 195\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 356, 361 (54 L. Ed. 435) is pertinent:\n'... Congress intended by its legislation to give the same force and effect to the decision of the Secretary of War that would have been accorded to direct action by it on the subject. It is for Congress, under the Constitution, to regulate the right of navigation by all appropriate means, to declare what is necessary to be done in order to free navigation from obstruction, and to prescribe the way in which the question of obstruction shall be determined. Its action in the premises cannot be revised or ignored by the courts or by juries, except that when it provides for an investigation of the facts, upon notice and after hearing, before final action is taken, the courts can see to it that executive officers conform their action to the mode prescribed by Congress.'\n\n See, also, Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 385\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 367; The Douglas, 7 Probate Division (1882) 157; Frost v. Railroad Co., 96 Me. 76, 51 Atl. 806, 59 L. R. A. 68; Maine Water Co. v. Knickerbocker Steam Towage Co., 99 Me. 473, 59 Atl. 953; The Plymouth, 225 Fed. 483, 140 C. C. A. 1.\n Even if we leave out a consideration altogether the order of the Secretary of War, it is still difficult to see upon what just ground petitioners could be held liable.\n The changes which occurred in the bed of the river were not due to natural causes, whose effect could reasonably have been anticipated, but were due to the artificial \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n operations of the Government the effect of which appeared only after the lapse of a long period of years.\n We agree with what was said by the District Court, in deciding the instand case, upon that subject:\n'While the railroad company was perhaps required to take notice of the changes in the course of the channel or stream from natural causes and provide against any injury that might result from such changes, it could not, in my opinion, be required to take notice of such radical changes as occurred here by the acts of the government over which it had no control and which it had no reason to anticipate or provide against.'\n\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals is that the question of liability was not affected by the fact that the conditions imposed by the Secretary of War were complied with, holding that these conditions or restrictions did not define the measure of liability to third persons rightfully navigating the river, and Maxon v. Chicago & North Western Railway Co. (D. C.) 122 Fed. 555, is relied upon in support of this view. That was a case, however, where a railroad company had constructed a bridge in conformity with the license granted by the War Department. The obstruction which caused the injury complained of consisted of stone and other material thrown into the river by the railroad company at the foot of and about one of the bridge abutments, and extending out into the channel; but it was no part of the bridge structure and was entirely unauthorized. The court held that the tug which collided with the obstruction had a right to the use of the channel to its full width and having no knowledge or warning of the presence of the obstruction was entitled to recover for the resulting injury. The stone and other material were unlawfully thrown into the stream and constituted from the beginning an unlawful obstruction. In the instant case the piles forming part of the old bridge were lawfully placed and lawfully maintained until they were \n\n[260 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n ordered removed by the Secretary of War. His order for their removal was complied with, and the channel was left by petitioners wholly unobstructed, in law and in fact. The obstruction did not develop until years afterward and was due to causes which they were not bound to anticipate and provide against and for which they were in no degree responsible.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC R.

Solicitor General Beck, Assistant Attorney General Riter, and H. L. Underwood, all of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office from going beyond what the plaintiff insists is the limit of their power and duty in dealing with a selection of indemnity land under the Act of July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 292, which made a land grant in aid of the construction of a railroad in California.\n The grantee constructed and put in operation the greater part of the road-495.52 miles-and thereby earned the right to have the grant fulfilled as to that part. \n\n[257 U.S. 460, 461]\n\u00a0\n As to the part not constructed-84 miles-the grant was forfeited. Act Sept. 29, 1890, c. 1040, 26 Stat. 496. The plaintiff long since succeeded to the rights of the grantee, and so much of the grant as was not forfeited is still in process of administration.\n The grant (section 3 and 18) included all the odd-numbered sections within prescribed place limits on either side of the road, save as some of the sections or parts of sections fell within excepting clauses in the grant, and in lieu of the lands excepted others were to be selected by the grantee, or its successor, 'under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,' in odd-numbered sections within prescribed indemnity limits.\n Among the excepted lands, usually called 'losses' or 'bases for indemnity,' was section 15 in a particular township. That section contained 640 acres, and each quarter quarter therein contained 40 acres. In presenting an extended list of indemnity selections, the plaintiff sought to use 15 acres of one of these quarter quarters as the base for a particular selection, without then using the remaining 28 acres, and that selection was rejected on the ground that under an existing regulation prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior it was not admissible to use a part of a minor legal subdivision as the base for a selection unless the remaining part was similarly used in the same list. Another base had been specified in the beginning, but on examination in the land office it was found to be a tract outside the place limits and the plaintiff then sought to use the present base in its stead.\n In the courts below the plaintiff took the position that the regulation operated as an arbitrary curtailment of its right of selection and was not within the scope of the power and duty of the Secretary, or of the Commissioner, in administering the indemnity provisions of the grant, and on that ground the plaintiff sought a mandatory injunction requiring those officers to deal with the selection \n\n[257 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n regardless of the regulation. Both courts held the plaintiff's position untenable and refused the injunction. 49 App. D. C. 241, 263 Fed. 637.\n To determine the question presented it is necessary to have in mind the situation which prompted the adopted of the regulation and also to understand how it is applied in actual practice.\n The public lands are surveyed and platted, as nearly as may be, into rectangular tracts, known as sections, half sections, quarter sections, half quarter sections, and quarter quarter sections, and where the lines of the survey are interrupted by lakes, public reservations, Spanish or Mexican grants, state or territorial lines, etc., the irregular tracts at the point of interruption are platted and known as fractional sections,, etc., or as lots having particular numbers. After the survey the land officers dispose of the lands only according to these legal subdivisions- that is, as sections, half sections, etc.-and regard the minor subdivisions, quarter quarter sections and lots, as not subject to further division, save in exceptional instances, where Congress has specially provided otherwise. Under this practice a right to purchase or enter 40 acres may be exercised by taking a full quarter quarter section, but not by taking a part only of each of two or more minor subdivisions. And the same rule is applied to relinquishments and lieu selections; that is to say, a right to relinquish land to which title has been acquired and to take other land in its stead may not be exercised by exchanging less than a legal subdivision at a time. In short, where Congress has not specially provided otherwise, the practice has been, and is, to conform all sales, entries, and other transactions to the subdivisions established by the survey, and to treat the minor subdivisions as indivisible for all administrative purposes.\n While the existence and scope of this practice are shown in many decisions of the Secretary of the Interior, it suf fices \n\n[257 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n here to refer to two. In one it is said to be well settled in the Land Department 'that, in the absence of a statute making special provision to the contrary, public lands can be disposed of only according to the legal subdivisions of the public survey,' Melder v. White, 28 Land Dec. 412, 420; and in the other it is said to be 'an established rule' of that department 'that parts of minor legal subdivisions of surveyed public lands cannot be entered, selected, relinquished, or surrendered, under the public land laws, except in entries of particular kinds,' Southern Pacific Railway Co., 46 Land Dec. 279, 281.\n In the exceptional instances in which Congress has directed otherwise the principle of the practice was not disturbed. All that was done was to provide a special mode of segregating and identifying particular lands which were being subjected to special forms of disposal which could not well be adjusted to the lines of the usual survey. The most conspicuous example of this is found in the laws regulating the disposal of mineral lands.\n The manner of keeping the land office records-which is according to a system of 'tract books'-and the mode of checking up and tracing the various land transactions have long been adjusted to this practice, and in the judgment of the land officers adherence to it is of much importance.\n The regulation in question adapts and applies this general practice to the selection of indemnity lands under railroad land grants by requiring (a) that the selections be accompanied by a specification, tract for tract, of the losses on which they are based; (b) that the selections be made by legal subdivisions; and (c) that in specifying the losses minor legal subdivisions be used in entireties and not in fragments.\n The last part of the regulation is what is challenged here. As applied and enforced by the land officers it is not directed against using parts of a minor subdivision as \n\n[257 U.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n bases for two or more selections where the entire subdivision is used in the same selection list, but only against using it in fragments to sustain distinct selections in different lists. To illustrate: Parts of a lost quarter quarter containing 40 acres may be specified as the bases for selecting two or more fractional subdivisions aggregating 40 acres where the selections are all included in a single list, but not otherwise. And conversely, the loss of two or more fractional subdivisions aggregating 40 acres may be made the base for selecting a quarter quarter of 40 acres where the selection is not made piecemeal in different lists. Southern Pacific Ry. Co., supra. It, however, is not required that the losses and selections be exactly matched in quantity, but only that they correspond 'as nearly as legal subdivisions will permit.' In other words, reasonable approximation is deemed sufficient and such minor differences as are practically unavoidable are disregarded. Florida Central and Peninsular R. R. Co., 15 Land Dec. 529; Bull v. Northern Pacific R. R. Co., 26 Land Dec. 693; Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 43 Land Dec. 534; Southern Pacific Ry. Co., supra.\n Thus understood, the regulation is merely an administrative measure designed to facilitate the examination and disposal of the selection lists and to be fair alike to the claimant and the government. It neither abridges the right of selection nor unreasonably obstructs its exercise, but, on the contrary, leaves the claimant free to select and obtain indemnity for all losses, if only the lands available in the indemnity limits are sufficient for the purpose.\n When the manifold losses to be indemnified under these extensive grants are considered it is apparent that some regulation of the mode of selection is essential. This is recognized in the several granting acts, all of which in substance, or in express terms, as here, provide that the selections shall be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. These provisions of course cannot \n\n[257 U.S. 460, 465]\n\u00a0\n be taken as investing the Secretary with authority to abridge the right to indemnity or to interpose any unreasonable obstruction to its exercise, Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 236\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 314; but in our opinion they do enable him, in the interest of an orderly and efficient administration, to prescribe and enforce reasonable regulations respecting the mode in which the selections shall be made and brought to the attention of the land officers.\n The regulation in question is of that character. Its evident purpose, as also its material tendency, is to simplify the task of examining and passing on the selections when presented; to avoid repeated searches to ascertain the status of the same minor subdivision, such as would be essential if it were used in fragments as bases for distinct selections made at different times; to guard against the mistakes incident to such a practice; and to conform the mode of selection to the usual procedure in public land transactions.\n There is nothing in this granting act with which the regulation conflicts. The grant is of sections and parts of sections to be identified by the usual survey and is accompanied by a provision, section 6, for a full survey of all lands within its exterior limits. The lands excepted are to be identified in the same way as those passing under the grant, and so of the lands which may be taken as indemnity. Thus the survey is made an element of every part of the grant. Nowhere in the granting act is there any suggestion of an intention that the grant or any part of it shall be administered otherwise than by legal subdivisions.\n For these reasons we hold that the regulation is within the scope of the power and duty of the Secretary of the Interior.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY.

Morton McDonald, of Princeton, Ind., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is concerned with a statute of Indiana under which judgment was obtained against the railway company upon a claim for damage to property which it received for transportation within the state.\n A motion is made by defendant in error to dismiss the writ of error; this court, it is contended, being without jurisdiction. The grounds of the motion are specified as follows: (1) The judgment, at the time the transcript was filed, had not become final. (2) It did not decide any federal question.\n To sustain the first ground, it is said, that under the law of the state, within 60 days after the termination of the case by the Supreme Court, 'either party may file a \n\n[260 U.S. 316, 319]\n\u00a0\n petition for a rehearing.' From this it is deduced and contended that the successful as well as the unsuccessful party in the action may file a petition for rehearing, and that until the expiration of the time for the exercise of the right the judgment does not become final. The contention is curious. Legal procedure is a facility of rights, and rights achieved, its purpose is done. A successful litigant does not need the delay and provision of a rehearing. He has more efficient and enduring relief. His affiction may be solaced by not enforcing the victory which is the cause of it. The contention of defendant in error is so obviously untenable that further comment upon it would be the veriest supererogation.\n In support of the second ground it is pointed out that the judgment to which the writ of error is directed was rendered on a second appeal and that the court decided that the decision 'on the first appeal is the law of the case.' It is hence asserted that it was res adjudicata and precluded dispute, and that therefore the decision rested upon an independent ground, not involving a federal question, and broad enough to maintain the judgment. For this Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Ellis, \n144 \nU.S. 458, 464\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 724, is cited. That case does not determine this one. That case was constrained by the law of the state; such constraint does not exist in the present case. The constitutional question involved was considered and decided. The prior ruling may have been followed as the law of the case, but there is a difference between such adherence and res adjudicata. One directs discretion: the other supersedes it and compels judgment. In other words, in one it is a question of power, in the other of submission. Remington v. Central Pacific Railroad Co., \n198 \nU.S. 95, 99\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 577; Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 739. The court in the present case, as we have said, considered the constitutional question presented and decided against it, and to \n\n[260 U.S. 316, 320]\n\u00a0\n review its decision is the purpose of this writ of error. The motion to dismiss is denied.\n The merits of the case are concerned with the validity of a statute of the state of Indiana passed in 1911 (Acts 1911, c. 183), providing for the presentation of claims for loss or damage to freight transported wholly within the state.\n A section of the act requires the claimant to present his claim within four months, and another section (section 3) prescribes the action and the time of action of the railroad company. It is as follows:\n'That every claim for loss of or damage to freight transported wholly between points within the state of Indiana may be presented to the agent of the carrier who issued the receipt or bill of lading therefor or to the freight agent or representative of such carrier at the point of destination, or to any freight agent of any carrier in whose possession such freight was when lost or damaged, and when so presented shall be paid or rejected by such carrier within ninety days therefrom, and if neither paid nor rejected in whole or in part within such time, such claim shall stand admitted as a liability due and payable to the full amount thereof against any such carrier, and may be recovered in any court having competent jurisdiction.'\n\n The assignments of error assail the quoted section as offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and in specification it is contended that the judgment of the court in sustaining the statute and in rendering judgment against the company for the full amount of the claim presented, together with interest, upon the pleading in the case denied to the company the right to defend the case on the merits as to the amount defendant in error was damaged and whether he was damaged at all.\n The invocation of the company is of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is admitted the \n\n[260 U.S. 316, 321]\n\u00a0\n effect of the decisions of this court is that the relation of carriers and shippers is 'a relation so peculiar as to render valid a classification based upon it.' If there may be class assignment, there may be class legislation. In other words, under the concession and the decisions that compel it, railroads have special characteristics and duties, and the legislation that is considerate of and appropriate to those characteristics and duties is due process of law. And this obviously. The service of a railroad is in the public interest; it is compulsory, and its purpose and duty are the transportation of persons and things promptly and safely, and the purpose and duty are fortified by responsibility for neglect of them or violation of them. And legislation may make an element of responsibility an early payment of loss or notification of controversy that responsibility may be enforced if it exist. In the legislation under review there is no impediment to investigation. Considering the facilities of the railroad company there is time for investigation and what can be discovered by it, and if controversy is resolved upon, the procedure of the law and the principles which direct the decisions of the law are available against the claim in whole or in part. Counsel is therefore in error, in the statement that the statute prohibits the railroad 'from contesting the justice of the claim which has been presented to it, and from showing, even though the claim is justified to a certain amount, it is not just to the extent claimed.'\n The company cites cases to sustain its contention that the statute of the state is unconstitutional. We do not review them, because we consider that they are not analogous or pertinent. They were not concerned with the time of the presentation of claims simply and suit upon them as in the Indiana statute. They were concerned with elements or conditions of liability in addition to the claims. Other cases which, in candor, the company has cited oppose its contention. In Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. \n\n[260 U.S. 316, 322]\n\u00a0\n Seegers, \n207 U.S. 77\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 28, a statute of South Carolina was held valid imposing a penalty of $50 on all common carriers for failure to adjust damage claims within 40 days from the time of demand. The statute was considered as not one of the mere refusal to pay a claim, nor was it decided to have that objection because a penalty of $50 could be imposed in case of recovery in court. The penalty was considered a legal deterrent upon the carrier in refusing the settlement of just claims and as compensation for the trouble and expense of suit. In Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 U.S. 217\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 40, the penalty prescribed was decided to be a reasonable incentive for the prompt settlement, without suit, of just demands of a class admitting of special legislative treatment. To the same effect is Kansas City Railway Co. v. Anderson, \n233 U.S. 326\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 599, Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Cade, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 678, and Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Nye- Schneider-Fowler Co., \n260 U.S. 35\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 55, 67 L. Ed. --, decided November 13, 1922\n\n\n In attempting to minimize these cases, or exclude them from authority, it seems to be contended, certainly implied, that by the statute, in case of suit by a claimant, he is excused from establishing his claim. The contention is untenable. The statute is clear and direct in its requirements. If the claim is just there is no injustice in requiring its payment; if the claim is deemed by the company to be unjust, the statute requires a declaration of the fact by its rejection. Upon rejection, suit, of course, must be brought for it, and it must be established. No penalty is imposed for its rejection, nor increase of its amount in consequence of rejection.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS COTTON COMPRESS CO. v. STATE OF ARKANSAS(1922)\nNo. 120\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. B. Rose, of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Wm. T. Hammock and F. G. Lindsey, both of Little Rock, Ark., for the State of Arkansas.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is a suit by the State of Arkansas against a corporation of Missouri authorized to do business in Arkansas. It is brought to recover five per cent. on the gross premiums paid by the defendant, the plaintiff in error, for insurance upon its property in Arkansas, to companies not authorized to do business in the State. A statute of the state purports to impose a liability for this amount as a tax. Crawford & Moses' Digest ( 1921)  9967. The answer alleged that the policies were contracted for, delivered and paid for in St. Louis, Missouri, the domicil of the corporation, because the rates were less than those charged by companies authorized to do business in Arkansas. It also alleged that long before the taxing act was passed the \n\n[260 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n defendant had made large investments in Arkansas in real and personal property essential to the conduct of its business, which it had held and operated over since. The plaintiff demurred. The low Court overruled the demurrer, but the Supreme Court sustained it, holding that the statute denied to the defendant no rights guaranteed to it by the Fourteenth Amendment. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff and the case was brought by writ of error to this Court.\n The Supreme Court justified the imposition as an occupation tax-that is, as we understand it, a tax upon the occupation of the defendant. But this Court although bound by the construction that the Supreme Court may put upon the statute is not bound by the characterization of it so far as that characterization may bear upon the question of its constitutional effect. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99. The short question is whether this so-called tax is saved because of the name given to it by the statute when it has been decided in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427, that the imposition of a round sum, called a fine, for doing the same thing, called an offence, is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is argued that there is a distinction because the Louisiana statute prohibits (by implication) what this statute permits. But that distinction, apart from some relatively insignificant collateral consequences, is merely in the amount of the detriment imposed upon doing the act. The name given by the State to the imposition is not conclusive. Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n259 U.S. 20\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 449, May 15, 1922, Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 U.S. 557\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 549, June 5, 1922. In Louisiana the detriment was $1000. Here it is 5 per cent. upon the premiums-which is 3 per cent. more than is charged for insuring in authorized companies. Each is a prohibition to the extent of the payment required. The Arkansas tax manifests no less plainly than the Louisiana fine a purpose to discourage insuring in companies that \n\n[260 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n do not pay tribute to the State. This case is stronger than that of Allgeyer in that here no act was done within the State, whereas there a letter constituting a step in the contract was posted within the jurisdiction. It is true that the State may regulate the activities of foreign corporations within the State but it cannot regulate or interfere with what they do outside. The other limit upon the State's power due to its having permitted the plaintiff in error to establish itself as alleged, need not be considered here. Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 414\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 157\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 295; Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.

WALLACE(1922)\nNo. 687\nArgued: Decided: May 1, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 495, 497]\u00a0\n These cases involve the constitutionality of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, approved August 15, 1921, so far as that act provides for the supervision by federal authority of the business of the commission men and of the live stock dealers in the great stockyards of the country. They are appeals from the orders of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois refusing to grant interlocutory injunctions as prayed. The bills sought to restrain enforcement of orders of the Secretary of Agriculture in carrying out the act, directed against the appellants in No. 687, as the commission men in the Union Stockyards of Chicago, and against the appellants in No. 691, as dealers in the same yards. The ground upon which the prayers for relief are based is that the Secretary's orders are void, because made under an act invalid as to each class of appellants. The bill in No. 687 makes defendants the Secretary of Agriculture and the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, averring that the latter is charged with the duty of enforcing the severe penalties imposed by the act for failure to comply with orders of the Secretary thereunder. The bill in No. 691 makes the United States attorney the only defendant, with the same averment.\n\n The two bills in substance allege that the Union Stockyards & Transit Company was incorporated by the state of Illinois in 1865, and given authority to acquire, construct, and maintain inclosures, structures, and railway lines for the reception, safe-keeping feeding, watering, and for weighing, delivery, and transfer, of cattle and live stock of every description, and to carry on a public live stock \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 498]\u00a0\n market, with all the necessary appurtenances and facilities; that it is the largest stockyards in the world, and in 1920 handled 15,000,000 head of live stock of all descriptions, including cattle, calves, hogs, and sheep, shipped mainly from outside the state of Illinois; that the live stock are loaded at the point of origin and shipped under a shipping contract which is a straight bill of lading, consigning them to the commission merchants at the yard; that on arrival the live stock are at once driven from the cars by the commission merchant, who is the consignee, to the pens assigned by the stockyards company to such merchant for his use; that they are then in the exclusive possession of the commission merchant, and are watered and fed by the stockyards company at his request; that with the delivery to the commission merchant the transportation is completely ended; that all the live stock consigned to commission merchants are sold by them for a commission or brokerage, and not on their own account; that they are sold at the stockyards, and nowhere else; that the commissions are fixed at an established rate per head; that the commission men remit to the owners and shippers the proceeds of sale, less their commission and the freight and yard charges paid by them; that the live stock are sold (1) to purchasers, who buy the same for slaughter at packing houses, located at the stockyards or adjacent thereto; (2) to purchasers, who buy to ship to packing houses outside the state of Illinois for slaughter; (3) to purchasers, who buy to feed and fatten the same; and (4) to dealers or traders; that about on-third of all the live stock received are sold to the dealers; that not until after the delivery of the live stock to the commission merchants and the transportation has completely ceased, does the business of the dealers begin; that they do not buy or sell on commission, but buy and sell for cash exclusively for their own profit; that the greater part of live stock received by commission men at \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 499]\u00a0\n the yards are in carload or trainload lots, and a substantial part are not graded or conditioned to meet the specific requirements of the buyers; that the dealers, after purchase, put the live stock in pens assigned to them by the stockyards owner and do the sorting and classification; that the dealers buy in open market in competition with each other; that they pay the expense of the custody, care, and feeding and watering the stock while they hold them; that they sell promptly, and have nothing to do with the shipment of the live stock they sell from the yards to points outside.\n\n In the bill in No. 691, the appellants aver that they are members of the Chicago Live Stock Exchange and of the National Live Stock Exchange, the members of which are dealers in all the stockyards of the country, numbering 2,000, and that they bring their bill for all of them who may choose to join and take the benefit of the litigation.\n\n The chairman of the Committee of Agriculture, in reporting to the House of Representatives the bill, which became the act here in question ( May 18, 1921, 67th Congress, 1st Session, Report No. 77, to accompany H. R. 6320), referred to the testimony printed in the House Committee Hearings of the 66th Congress, 2d Session, Committee on Agriculture, vols. 220-2 and 220-3, as furnishing the contemporaneous history and information of the evils to be remedied upon which the bill was framed.\n\n It appeared from the data before the committee that for more than two decades it had been charged that the five great packing establishments of Swift, Armour, Cudahy, Wilson, and Morris, called the 'Big Five,' were engaged in a conspiracy in violation of the Anti-Trust Law (Comp St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), to control the business of the purchase of the live stock, their preparation for use in meat products, and the distribution and sale thereof in this country and abroad. In 1903 a bill in equity was filed by the United States to enjoin further conduct of this alleged conspiracy, as a \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 500]\u00a0\n violation of the Anti-Trust Law, and an injunction issued. United States v. Swift (C. C.) 122 Fed. 529. The case was taken on appeal to this court, which sustained the injunction. Swift v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375, 25 Sup. Ct. 276. In 1912, these same defendants, or their successors in business, were indicted and tried for such violation of the Anti-Trust Law, and acquitted. See House Committee Hearings before Committee on Agriculture, 1820, vol. 220-2, subject, Meat Packer Legislation, 718. It further appeared that on February 7, 1917, the President directed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and report the facts relating to this industry and kindred subjects. The Commission reported that the 'Big Five' packing firms, had complete control of the trade from the producer to the consumer, had eliminated competition, and that one of the essential means by which this was made possible was their ownership of a controlling part of the stock in the stockyards companies of the country. The Commission stated its conclusions as follows:\n\n'The big packers' control of these markets is much greater than these statistics indicate. In the first place, they are the largest and in some cases practically the only buyers at these various markets, and as such hold a whip hand over the commission men who act as the intermediaries in the sale of live stock.\n\n'The packers' power is increased by the fact that they control all the facilities through which live stock is sold to themselves. Control of stockyards comprehends control of live stock exchange buildings, where commission men have their offices; control of assignment of pens to commission men; control of banks and cattle loan companies; control of terminal and switching pacilities; control of yardage services and charges; control of weighing facilities; control of the disposition of dead animals and other profitable yard monopolies; and in most cases control of all packing house and other business sites. Packer-owned \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 501]\u00a0\n stockyards give these interests access to records containing confidential shipping information, which is used to the disadvantage of shippers who have attempted to forward their live stock to a second market.'\n\n Summary of Report of the Federal Trade Commission on Meat-Packing Industry, July 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Following the report of the Federal Trade Commission, and before the passage of this act, a bill in equity for injunction was filed in 1920, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, in which, on February 27th of that year, was entered a decree against the same Big Five packers, consented to by them, with the saving clause that it should not be considered as an admission that they had been guilty of violations of law. The decree enjoined the packers from doing many acts in pursuance of a combination to monopolize the purchase and control the price of live stock, and the sale and distribution of meat products and of many by-products in preparation of meats and in unrelated lines, not here relevant, and from continuing to own or control, directly or indirectly, any interest in any public stockyard market company in the United States, or in any stockyard market journal, or in any stockyard terminal railroad or in any public cold storage warehouse. House Committee Hearings, Committee on Agriculture, 1920, vol. 220-2, p. 720, 'Meat Packer Legislation.'\n\n It appears from these committee hearings that the dealers do not buy fat cattle generally, or largely compete with packers in such purchases. They buy either the thin cattle, known as 'stockers and feeders,' which they dispose of to farmers and stock feeders, to be taken to the country for farm use and fattening, or they buy mixed lots, and cull out of them the fat cattle. These they dispose of to packers, either directly or through commission men. The proportion of all the hogs passing through the yards in 1919 handled by these traders, speculators, or scalpers, as they are indifferently called. was 30 per cent. Of all \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 502]\u00a0\n the butcher cattle they handled 20 per cent., of the beef cattle 10 per cent., and of 'the stockers and feeders' 80 per cent. At Kansas City, this last figure was higher, reaching 95 per cent. Committee Hearings, p. 2140.\n\n It was conceded that, of all the live stock coming into the Chicago stockyards and going out, only a small percentage, less than 10 per cent., is shipped from or to Illinois.\n\n The complaints of the shippers of live stock against the charges and practices, working to their prejudice in the conduct of the stockyards, the commission men, and the dealers, were: First, suppression of competition in purchases through agreement, by which one packer would buy a carload or trainload of cattle and turn over half of it to the only other packer buying in the local market. Second, 'wiring on.' A shipper would send a carload or trainload of stock to one stockyard. Finding the market unsatisfactory, he would ship them further east. The packers' agents were promptly advised at the second stockyards and, controlling the price there, they made it the same as at the first stockyards, though the shipper had paid the freight, and had to stand the 'shrink' of the cattle from the journey. Third, the charges in the stockyards for hay and other facilities were excessive. Fourth, the duplication of commissions through the collusion of the commission men and the dealers, by which commission men would sell at a lower price to dealers than to outside buyers, and drive the latter to buying from dealers through commission men, forcing two commissions. Fifth, the monopoly conferred by the stockyards owner on a company in which packers were largely interested, of buying at a fixed price of $5 a head all dead cattle for rendering purposes, when they were worth more. Sixth, the frequency with which commission men reported to shippers that live stock had been crippled and had to be sold in that condition at a lower price, arousing suspicion as to the fact \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 503]\u00a0\n and if it was a fact, as to the cause of the crippling.

The latter act gives a right to a direct appeal to this court from the granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction. Hence the appeals herein are properly prosecuted.\n\n In each bill the averments are sufficient, if the act be invalid, to show equitable grounds for injunction in the severe penalties incurred for failure to comply with the act before opportunity can be given to test its validity. Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123, 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764.\n\n We have framed the statement of the case, not for the purpose of deciding the issues of fact mooted between the packers and their accusers before the Federal Trade Commission or the Committees of Agriculture in Congress, but only to enable us to consider and discuss the act whose validity is here in question in the light of the environment \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 513]\u00a0\n in which Congress passed it. It was for Congress to decide from its general information and from such special evidence as was brought before it, the nature of the evils actually present or threatening, and to take such steps by legislation within its power as it deemed proper to remedy them. It is helpful for us in interpreting the effect and scope of the act in order to determine its validity to know the conditions under which Congress acted. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 242; Danciger v. Cooley, \n248 \nU.S. 319, 322, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 119.\n\n The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 seeks to regulate the business of the packers done in interstate commerce and forbids them to engage in unfair, discriminatory, or deceptive practices in such commerce, or to subject any person to unreasonable prejudice therein, or to do any of a number of acts to control prices or establish a monopoly in the business. It constitutes the Secretary of Agriculture a tribunal to hear complaints and make findings thereon, and to order the packers to cease any forbidden practice. An appeal is given to the Circuit Court of Appeals from these findings and orders. They are to be enforced by the District Court by penalty if not appealed from and if disobeyed. Title 3 concerns the stockyards and provides for the supervision and control of the facilities furnished therein in connection with the receipt, purchase, sale on commission basis, or otherwise, of live stock, and its care, shipment, weighing, or handling in interstate commerce. A stockyards is defined to be a place conducted for profit as a public market, with pens in which live stock are received and kept for sale or shipment in interstate commerce. Yards with a superficial area less than 20,000 square feet are not within the act. Stockyard owners, commission men, and dealers are recognized and defined, and the two latter are required to register. The act requires that all rates and charges for services and facilities in the stockyards and all practices in \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 514]\u00a0\n connection with the live stock passing through the yards shall be just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and nondeceptive, and that a schedule of such charges shall be kept open for public inspection, and only be changed after 10 days' notice to the Secretary of Agriculture, who is made a tribunal to inquire as to the justice, reasonableness, and nondiscriminatory or nondeceptive character of every charge and practice, and to order that it cease, if found to offend, with the same provisions for appeal and enforcement in court as in the case of offending packers. The Secretary is given power to make rules and regulations to carry out the provisions, to fix rates, or a minimum or maximum thereof, and to prescribe how every packer, stockyard owner, commission man, and dealer shall keep accounts.\n\n The bills aver that the Secretary has given the notice which requires appellants to register, and has announced proposed rules and regulations, prescribing the form of rate schedules, the required reports, including daily accounts of receipts, sales, and shipments, forbidding misleading reports to depress or enhance prices, prescribing proper feed and care of live stock, and forbidding a commission man to sell live stock to another in whose business he is interested, without disclosing such interest to his principal.\n\n The object to be secured by the act is the free and unburdened flow of live stock from the ranges and farms of the West and the Southwest through the great stockyards and slaughtering centers on the borders of that region, and thence in the form of meat products to the consuming cities of the country in the Middle West and East, or, still, as live stock, to the feeding places and fattening farms in the Middle West or East for further preparation for the market.\n\n The chief evil feared is the monopoly of the packers, enabling them unduly and arbitrarily to lower prices to \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 515]\u00a0\n the shipper, who sells, and unduly and arbitrarily to increase the price to the consumer, who buys. Congress thought that the power to maintain this monopoly was aided by control of the stockyards. Another evil, which it sought to provide against by the act, was exorbitant charges, duplication of commissions, deceptive practices in respect of prices, in the passage of the live stock through the stockyards, all made possible by collusion between the stockyards management and the commission men, on the one hand, and the packers and dealers, on the other. Expenses incurred in the passage through the stockyards necessarily reduce the price received by the shipper, and increase the price to be paid by the consumer. If they be exorbitant or unreasonable, they are an undue burden on the commerce which the stockyards are intended to facilitate. Any unjust or deceptive practice or combination that unduly and directly enhances them is an unjust obstruction to that commerce. The shipper, whose live stock are being cared for and sold in the stockyards market, is ordinarily not present at the sale, but is far away in the West. He is wholly dependent on the commission men. The packers and their agents and the dealers, who are the buyers, are at the elbow of the commission men, and their relations are constant and close. The control that the packers have had in the stockyards by reason of ownership and constant use, the relation of landlord and tenant between the stockyards owner, on the one hand, and the commission men and the dealers, on the other, the power of assignment of pens and other facilities by that owner to commission men and dealers, all create a situation full of opportunity and temptation, to the prejudice of the absent shipper and owner in the neglect of the live stock, in the mala fides of the sale, in the exorbitant prices obtained, and in the unreasonableness of the charges for services rendered.\n\n The stockyards are not a place of rest or final destination. Thousands of head of live stock arrive daily by \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 516]\u00a0\n carload and trainload lots, and must be promptly sold and disposed of and moved out, to give place to the constantly flowing traffic that presses behind. The stockyards are but a throat through which the current flows, and the transactions which occur therein are only incident to this current from the West to the East, and from one state to another. Such transactions cannot be separated from the movement to which they contribute and necessarily take on its character. The commission men are essential in making the sales, without which the flow of the current would be obstructed, and this, whether they are made to packers or dealers. The dealers are essential to the sales to the stock farmers and feeders. The sales are not in this aspect merely local transactions. They create a local change of title, it is true, but they do not stop the flow; they merely change the private interests in the subject of the current, not interfering with, but, on the contrary, being indispensable to, its continuity. The origin of the live stock is in the West; its ultimate destination, known to, and intended by, all engaged in the business, is in the Middle West and East, either as meat products or stock for feeding and fattening. This is the definite and well-understood course of business. The stockyards and the sales are necessary factors in the middle of this current of commerce.\n\n The act, therefore, treats the various stockyards of the country as great national public utilities to promote the flow of commerce from the ranges and farms of the West to the consumers in the East. It assumes that they conduct a business affected by a public use of a national character and subject to national regulation. That it is a business within the power of regulation by legislative action needs no discussion. That has been settled since the case of Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113. Nor is there any doubt that in the receipt of live stock by rail and in their delivery by rail the stockyards are an interstate commerce \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 517]\u00a0\n agency. United States v. Union Stock Yards Co., \n226 U.S. 286, 33 Sup. Ct. 83. The only questior here is whether the business done in the stockyards, between the receipt of the live stock in the yards and the shipment of them therefrom, is a part of interstate commerce, or is so associated with it as to bring it within the power of national regulation. A similar question has been before this court and had great consideration in Swift v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375, 25 Sup. Ct. 276. The judgment in that case gives a clear and comprehensive exposition, which leaves to us in this case little but the obvious application of the principles there declared.\n\n The Swift Case presented to this court the sufficiency of a bill in equity brought against substantially the same packing firms as those against whom this legislation is chiefly directed, charging them as a combination of a dominant proportion of the dealers in fresh meat throughout the United States not to bid against each other in the live stock markets of the different states, to bid up prices for a few days, in order to induce the cattle men to send their stock to the stockyards, to fix prices at which they would sell, and to that end to restrict shipments of meat when necessary, to establish a uniform credit to dealers, and to keep a black list, to make uniform and improper charges for cartage, and finally to get less than lawful rates from the railroads, to the exclusion of competitors, and all this in a conspiracy and single connected scheme to monopolize the supply and distribution of fresh meats throughout the United States. In holding the bill good, this court said (\n196 U.S. 396, 25 Sup. Ct. 279):\n\n'The scheme as a whole seems to us to be within reach of the law. The constituent elements, as we have stated them, are enough to give to the scheme a body and, for all that we can say, to accomplish it . ... It is suggested that the several acts charged are lawful and that intent can make no difference. But they are bound to gether \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 518]\u00a0\n as the parts of a single plan. The plan may make the parts unlawful. Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 U.S. 194, 206. The statute gives this proceeding against combinations in restraint of commerce among the states and against attempts to monopolize the same. Intent is almost essential to such a combination and is essential to such an attempt.'\n\n Again (\n196 \nU.S. 396, 397, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 279):\n\n'Although the combination alleged embraces restraint and monopoly of trade within a single state, its effect upon commerce among the states is not accidental, secondary, remote, or merely probable. ... Here the subjectmatter is sales, and the very point of the combination is to restrain and monopolize commerce among the states in respect of such sales.'\n\n Again (\n196 \nU.S. 398, 399, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 280), in answer to the objection that what was charged did not constitute a case involving commerce among the states, the court said:\n\n'Commerce among the states is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business. When cattle are sent for sale from a place in one state, with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase, in another, and when in effect they do so, with only the interruption necessary to find a purchaser at the stockyards, and when this is a typical, constantly recurring course, the current thus existing is a current of commerce among the states, and the purchase of the cattle is a part and incident of such commerce. What we say is true at least of such a purchase by residents in another state from that of the seller and of the cattle. ...'\n\n The application of the commerce clause of the Constitution in the Swift Case was the result of the natural development of interstate commerce under modern conditions. It was the inevitable recognition of the great \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 519]\u00a0\n central fact that such streams of commerce from one part of the country to another, which are ever flowing, are in their very essence the commerce among the states and with foreign nations, which historically it was one of the chief purposes of the Constitution to bring under national protection and control. This court declined to defeat this purpose in respect of such a stream and take it out of complete national regulation by a nice and technical inquiry into the noninterstate character of some of its necessary incidents and facilities, when considered alone and without reference to their association with the movement of which they were an essential but subordinate part.\n\n The principles of the Swift Case have become a fixed rule of this court in the construction and application of the commerce clause. It latest expression on the subject is found in Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 U.S. 50, 42 Sup. Ct. 244, 66 L. Ed. --, decided at this term, February 27, 1922. In that case it was held, on the authority of the Swift Case, that the delivery and sale of wheat by farmers to local grain elevators in North Dakota, to be shipped to Minneapolis, when practically all the wheat purchased by such elevators was so shipped, and the price was fixed by that in the Minneapolis market, less profit and freight, constituted a course of business, and determined the interstate character of the transaction. Accordingly a state statute, which sought to regulate the price and profit of such sales, and was found to interfere with the free flow of interstate commerce, was declared invalid as a violation of the commerce clause. Similar confirmation of the principle of the Swift Case is to be found in Dahnke v. Bondurant, \n257 U.S. 282, 42 Sup. Ct. 106, in Eureka Pipe Line v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 265, 42 Sup. Ct. 101, and in United Fuel Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 277, 42 Sup. Ct. 105, all decided December 12, 1921; in Western Union Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 113, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; United States v. \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 520]\u00a0\n Reading, \n226 \nU.S. 324, 367, 368 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 90; Ohio R. R. Co. v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 108, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 653, and Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 301, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815.\n\n It is manifest that Congress framed the Packers and Stockyards Act in keeping with the principles announced and applied in the opinion in the Swift Case. The recital in section 2, par. b, of title 1 of the act, quoted in the margin, leaves no doubt of this. \n1 The act deals with the same current of business, and the same practical conception of interstate commerce.\n\n Of course, what we are considering here is not a bill in equity or an indictment charging conspiracy to obstruct interstate commerce, but a law. The language of the law shows that what Congress had in mind primarily was to prevent such conspiracies by supervision of the agencies which would be likely to be employed in it. If Congress could provide for punishment or restraint of such conspiracies after their formation through the Anti- Trust Law as in the Swift Case, certainly it may provide regulation to prevent their formation. The reasonable fear by Congress that such acts, usually lawful and affecting only intrastate commerce when considered alone, will probably \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 521]\u00a0\n and more or less constantly be used in conspiracies against interstate commerce or constitute a direct and undue burden on it, expressed in this remedial legislation, serves the same purpose as the intent charged in the Swift indictment to bring acts of a similar character into the current of interstate commerce for federal restraint. Whatever amounts to more or less constant practice, and threatens to obstruct or unduly to burden the freedom of interstate commerce is within the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause, and it is primarily for Congress to consider and decide the fact of the danger and meet it. This court will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress in such a matter unless the relation of the subject to interstate commerce and its effect upon it are clearly nonexistent.\n\n In United States v. Ferger et al., \n250 U.S. 199, 39 Sup. Ct. 445, the validity of an act of Congress punishing forgery and utterance of bills of lading for fictitious shipments in interstate commerce was in question. It was contended that there was and could be no commerce in a fraudulent and fictitious bill of lading, and therefore that the power of Congress could not embrace such pretended bill. In upholding the act, this court, speaking through Chief Justice White, answered the objection by saying:\n\n'But this mistakenly assumes that the power of Congress is to be necessarily tested by the intrinsic existence of commerce in the particular subject dealt with, instead of by the relation of that subject to commerce and its effect upon it. We say mistakenly assumes, because we think it clear that if the proposition were sustained, it would destroy the power of Congress to regulate, as obviously that power, if it is to exist, must include the authority to deal with obstructions to interstate commerce (In re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564), and with a host of other acts which, because of their relation to and influence upon interstate \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 522]\u00a0\n commerce, come within the power of Congress to regulate, although they are not interstate commerce in and of themselves.'\n\n The Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456) presents a close analogy to this case. It authorizes supervision by the Interstate Commerce Commission of intrastate commerce, where it is so carried on as to work undue, unreasonable advantage or preference in favor of persons or localities in intrastate commerce, as against those in interstate commerce, or any undue, unjust, or unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce itself. Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., \n257 U.S. 563, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, decided February 27, 1922. That case followed the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 432, 433 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Houston & Texas Ry. v. U. S., \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 833; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 U.S. 493, 38 Sup. Ct. 170; B. & O. Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612, 618, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 621; Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26, 27 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 2; Second Employers' Liability Case, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 48, 51 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. The principle of these cases is thus clearly stated by the court in Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 399, 33 Sup. Ct. 739, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18:\n\n'The authority of Congress extends to every part of interstate commerce, and to every instrumentality and agency by which it is carried on; and the full control by Congress of the subjects committed to its regulation is not to be denied or thwarted by the commingling of interstate and intrastate operations. This is not to say that the nation may deal with the internal concerns of the state as such, but that the execution by Congress of its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce is not limited by the fact that intrastate transactions may have become so interwoven therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter. This conclusion necessarily results from the supremacy of the national power within its appointed sphere.' \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 523]\u00a0\n In section 311 of the act, quoted in the margin,2 Congress gives to the Secretary of Agriculture in respect to intrastate transactions that affect prejudicially interstate commerce under his protection, the same powers given to the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to intrastate commerce which affects prejudicially interstate railroad commerce in paragraph 4, section 13, as amended in section 416 of the Transportation Act of 1920. This was the paragraph and section which were enforced in Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., supra, and the validity of which was upheld by this Court.\n\n Counsel for appellants cite cases to show that transactions like those of the commission men or dealers here are not interstate commerce or within the power of Congress to regulate. The chief of these are Hopkins v. \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 524]\n United States, \n171 U.S. 578, 19 Sup. Ct. 40, and Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604, 19 Sup. Ct. 50. These cases were considered in the Swift Case and disposed of by the court as follows (\n196 U.S. 397, 25 Sup. Ct. 280):\n\n'So, again, the line is distinct between this case and Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578. All that was decided there was that the local business of commission merchants was not commerce among the states, even if what the brokers were employed to sell was an object of such commerce. The brokers were not like the defendants before us, themselves the buyers and sellers. They only furnish certain facilities for the sales. Therefore, there again the effects of the combination of brokers upon the commerce was only indirect and not within the act. Whether the case would have been different if the combination had resulted in exorbitant charges, was left open. In Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604, the defendants were buyers and sellers at the stockyards, but their agreement was merely not to employ brokers, or to recognize yard traders, who were not members of their association. Any yard trader could become a member of the association on complying with the conditions, and there was said to be no feature of monopoly in the case. It was held that the combination did not directly regulate commerce between the states, and, being formed with a different intent, was not within the act. The present case is more like Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38.'\n\n It is clear from this that if the bill in the Swift Case had averred that control of the stockyards and the commission men was one of the means used by the packers to make arbitrary prices in their plan of monopolizing the interstate commerce, the acts of the stockyards owners and commission men would have been regarded as directly affecting interstate commerce and within the Anti-Trust Act. Congress has found as an evil to be apprehended and to be prevented by the act here in question, in the \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 525]\u00a0\n use and control of stockyards and the commission men to promote a packers' monopoly of interstate commerce. The act finds and imports this injurious direct effect of such agencies upon interstate commerce, just as the intent of the conspiracy charged in the indictment in the Swift Case tied together the parts of the scheme there attacked and imported their direct effect upon interstate commerce.\n\n Again, if the result of the combination of commission men in the Hopkins Case had been to impose exorbitant charges on the passage of the live stock through the stockyards from one state to another, the case would have been different, as the court suggests. The effect on interstate commerce in such a case would have been direct. Similarly, in the Anderson Case, if the combination of dealers had been directed to collusion with the commission men to secure sales at unduly low prices to the dealers and to double commissions, or to practice any other fraud or oppression calculated to decrease the price received by the shipper and increase the price to the purchaser in the passage of live stock through the stockyards in interstate commerce, this would have been a direct burden on such commerce and within the Anti-Trust Act.\n\n The other cases relied on by appellants are less relevant to this discussion than the Anderson and Hopkins Cases. Some of them are tax cases. As to them it is well to bear in mind the words of the Court in the Swift Case, \n196 U.S. 400, 25 Sup. Ct. 281:\n\n'But we do not mean to imply that the rule which marks the point at which state taxation or regulation becomes permissible necessarily is beyond the scope of interference by Congress ... where such interference is deemed necessary for the protection of commerce among the states.'\n\n Thus take the case of Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504, 33 Sup. Ct. 299. Bacon had purchased grain in transit from a western state to the east. He exercised the power under his contract \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 526]\u00a0\n to stop the grain in Illinois and put it in a grain elevator there. He intended to send it on to some other state for sale. He might have changed his mind. He did, however, after a time, send it out of the state. The grain was taxed while it was in Illinois. The question was whether it was immune from taxation because in transit in interstate commerce. Following the cases of Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123; Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517, 6 Sup. Ct. 475; Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091; Pittsburg & Southern Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 U.S. 577, 15 Sup. Ct. 415; Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 \nU.S. 82, 93, 96 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 266; Kelley v. Rhoads, \n188 \nU.S. 1, 5, 7 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 259; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 U.S. 211, 28 Sup. Ct. 475; and American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500, 24 Sup. Ct. 365, it was held that property in a state which its owner intends to transport to some other state, but which is not in actual transit and in respect to the disposition of which he may change his mind is not in interstate commerce just because of the intention of its owner, and may, therefore, be taxed by the state where it is. The court brought out the distinction between such cases and this in the remark (\n227 U.S. 516, 33 Sup. Ct. 303):\n\n'The question, it should be observed, is not with respect to the extent of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, but whether a particular exercise of state power in view of its nature and operation must be deemed to be in conflict with this paramount authority.'\n\n Moreover, it will be noted that even in tax cases where the tax is directed against a commodity in an actual flowing and constant stream out of a state from which the owner may withdraw part of it for use or sale in the state before it reaches the state border, we have held that a tax on the flow is a burden on interstate commerce which the state may not impose because such flow in interstate commerce is an established course of business. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 277, 42 Sup. Ct. 105, decided December 12, 1921. Eureka \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 527]\u00a0\n Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan et al., \n257 U.S. 265, 42 Sup. Ct. 101, decided December 12, 1921. In the former, the court summed up as follows:\n\n'In short the great body of the gas starts for points outside the state and goes to them. That the necessities of business require a much smaller amount destined to points within the state to be carried undistinguished in the same pipes does not affect the character of the major transportation. Neither is the case as to the gas sold to the three companies changed by the fact that the plaintiff, as owner of the gas, and the purchasers after they receive it might change their minds before the gas leaves the state and that the precise proportions between local and outside deliveries may not have been fixed, although they seem to have been. The typical and actual course of events marks the carriage of the greater part as commerce among the states and theoretical possibilities may be left out of account. There is no break, no period of deliberation, but a steady flow ending as contemplated from the beginning beyond the state line. Ohio R. R. Commission v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101, 108; United States v. Reading Co., \n226 U.S. 324, 367; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 U.S. 105, 113.'\n\n The case of Blumenstock v. Curtis, \n252 U.S. 436, 40 Sup. Ct. 385, is easily distinguished from the one at the bar. There it was merely held that an attempt of a publisher to monopolize the business of publishing advertising matter in magazines, resulting in refusal of such publisher to accept advertisements in his magazines, was too remote in its relation to the interstate commerce of circulating magazines. The court said:\n\n'This case is wholly unlike International Text-Book v. Pigg, \n217 U.S. 91, wherein there was a continuous interstate traffic in text-books and apparatus for a course of study pursued, by means of correspondence, and the movements in interstate commerce were held to bring the subject \n\n[258 U.S. 495, 528]\u00a0\n matter within the domain of federal control, and to exempt it from the burden imposed by state legislation.'\n\n Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Knight, \n192 U.S. 21, 24 Sup. Ct. 202, relied on by counsel for appellants and said to be exactly applicable to the case at bar, was an effort by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to secure immunity from city regulation for a cab system which it ran in New York to and from its station to points in New York City, on the ground that it was part of interstate commerce. This court held that, because it was independent of the railroad transportation, and not included in the contract of railroad carriage, it did not come within interstate commerce. The case was distinguished in the Swift Case, \n196 U.S. 401, 25 Sup. Ct. 281, from cartage for delivery of the goods when part of the contemplated transit. There is nothing in the case to indicate that if such an agency could be and were used in a conspiracy unduly and constantly to monopolize interstate passenger traffic, it might not be brought within federal restraint.\n\n As already noted, the word 'commerce,' when used in the act, is defined to be interstate and foreign commerce. Its provisions are carefully drawn to apply only to those practices and obstructions which in the judgment of Congress are likely to affect interstate commerce prejudicially. Thus construed and applied, we think the act clearly within Congressional power and valid.\n\n Other objections are made to the act and its provisions as violative of other limitations of the Constitution, but the only one seriously pressed was that based on the commerce clause, and we do not deem it necessary to discuss the others.\n\n The orders of the District Court refusing the interlocutory injunctions are\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY did not sit in these cases and took no part in their decision. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1] The first title (section 2, paragraph b) provides that: 'For the purpose of this act a transaction in respect to any article shall be considered to be in commerce if such article is part of that current of commerce usual in the live stock and meat packing industries whereby live stock and its products are sent from one state with the expectation that they will end their transit after purchase in another, including, in addition to cases within the general description, all cases whose purchase or sale is either for shipment to another state, or for slaughter of the live stock within the state and the shipment outside of the state of the products resulting from such slaughter. Articles normally in such current of commerce shall not be considered out of such current through resort being had to any means or device intended to remove transactions in respect thereto from the provisions of the act.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2] Section 311 is as follows:\n'Whenever in any investigation under the provisions of this title or in any investigation instituted by petition of the stockyard owner or market agency concerned which petition is hereby authorized to be filed, the Secretary after full hearing finds that any rate, charge, regulation or practice of any stockyard owner or market agency for or in connection with the buying, or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, receiving, marketing, feeding, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing or handling, not in commerce, or live stock, causes any undue or unreasonable advantage, or preference as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce in live stock on the one hand, and interstate or foreign commerce in live stock, on the other hand, or any undue, unjust, or unreasonable discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful, the Secretary shall prescribe the rate, charge, regulation or practice thereafter to be observed in such manner as in his judgment will remove such advantage, preference, or discrimination. Such rates, charges, regulations or practices shall be observed while in effect by the stockyard owners or market agencies parties to such proceeding affected thereby, the law of any state or the decision of any state authority to the contrary notwithstanding.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD FASHION CO. v. MAGRANE-HOUSTON CO.(1922)\nNo. 20\nArgued: January 25, 1921Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Herbert Noble, of New York City, Robert G. Dodge, of Boston, Mass., and Charles E. Hughes and James B. Sheehan, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C. (Messrs. La Rue Brown, and Elias Field, both of Boston, Mass., of counsel and on the brief), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to restrain the respondent from violating a certain contract concerning the sale of patterns for garments worn by women and children, called standard patterns. The bill was dismissed by the District Court and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 259 Fed. 793, 170 C. C. A. 593.\n Petitioner is a New York corporation engaged in the manufacture and distribution of patterns. Respondent conducted a retail dry goods business at the corner of Washington street and Temple place in the city of Boston. On November 14, 1914, the parties entered into a contract by which the petitioner granted to the respondent an agency for the sale of standard patterns at respondent's store, for a term of two years from the date of the contract, and from term to term thereafter until the agreement should be terminated as thereinafter provided. Petitioner agreed to sell to respondent standard patterns \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n at a discount of 50 per cent. from retail prices, with advertising matter and publications upon terms stated, and to allow respondent to return discarded patterns semiannually between January 15th and February 15th, and July 15th and August 15th, in exchange at nine-tenths cost for other patterns to be shipped from time to time thereafter. The contract provided that patterns returned for exchange must have been purchased from the petitioner, and must be delivered in good order to the general office of the seller in New York. Respondent agreed to purchase a substantial number of standard fashion sheets, to purchase and keep on hand at all times, except during the period of exchange, $1,000 value in standard patterns at net invoice price, and to pay petitioner for the pattern stock to be selected by it on terms of payment which are stated. Respondent agreed not to assign or transfer the agency, or to remove it from its original location, without the written consent of the petitioner, and not to sell or permit to be sold on its premises during the term of the contract any other make of patterns, and not to sell standard patterns except at labeled prices. Respondent agreed to permit petitioner to take account of pattern stock whenever it desired, to pay proper attention to the sale of standard patterns, to conserve the best interests of the agency at all times, and to reorder promptly as patterns were sold. Either party desiring to terminate the agreement was required to give the other party 3 months' notice in writing within 30 days after the expiration of any contract period, the agency to continue during such 3 months. Upon expiration of such notice respondent agreed to promptly return to petitioner all standard patterns, and petitioner agreed to credit respondent for the same on receipt in good order at three-fourths cost. Neglect to return the pattern stock within 2 weeks after the expiration of the 3 months' notice to relieve the petitioner from all obligation to \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 353]\n\u00a0\n redeem the same. It was further stipulated that in the event the business property of the respondent, or a substantial part thereof, should be disposed of by respondent for business other than that of dry goods or as a general department store, the respondent should have the privilege of terminating the contract by giving the petitioner due notice of such change. Two weeks after the change in the premises had been made the respondent might deliver its stock of standard patterns to the petitioner for repurchase under the repurchase clause of the contract.\n We agree with the courts below that the notices not having been gives as required by the contract, the same continued in force until three months from November 25, 1918, to wit, to February 25, 1919. It is contended in the brief for the government, filed by it as amicus curiae, that, as the date last mentioned had elapsed pending the suit, the case has become moot; but we are unable to agree with such contention. The bill prayed an assessment of damages as far as chpable of ascertainment. The record shows that such damages were capable at least of partial ascertainment.\n The suggestion that the respondent had wound up its affairs, and had gone out of business on March 27, 1920, is met by General Laws of Massachusetts,  51, continuing its corporate existence for the period of 3 years for the purpose of prosecuting or defending suits by or against it.\n The principal question in the case, and the one upon which the writ of certiorari was granted, involves the construction of section 3 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stats. 731 (Comp. St.  8835c). That section, so far as pertinent here, provides:\n'It shall be unlawful ... to ... make a sale or contract for sale of goods ... or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 354]\n\u00a0\n lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods ... of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.'\n\n The contract contains an agreement that the respondent shall not sell or permit to be sold on its premises during the term of the contract any other make of patterns. It is shown that on or about July 1, 1917, the respondent discontinued the sale of the petitioner's patterns and placed on sale in its store patterns of a rival company known as the McCall Company.\n It is insisted by the petitioner that the contract is not one of sale, but is one of agency or joint venture; but an analysis of the contract shows that a sale was in fact intended and made. It is provided that patterns returned for exchange must have been purchased from the petitioner. Respondent agreed to purchase a certain number of patterns. Upon expiration of the notice of termination the respondent agreed to promptly return all standard patterns bought under the contract. In the event of the disposition of the business property of the respondent at Washington street and Temple place, the respondent might deliver its stock of standard patterns to the petitioner for repurchase under the repurchase clause of the contract.\n Full title and dominion passed to the buyer. While this contract is denominated one of agency, it is perfectly apparent that it is one of sale. Straus et al. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 U.S. 490\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955.\n The contract required the purchaser not to deal in goods of competitors of the seller. It is idle to say that the covenant was limited to the premises of the purchaser, and that sales might be made by it elsewhere. The contract should have a reasonable construction. The purchaser \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 355]\n\u00a0\n kept a retail store in Boston. It was not contemplated that it would make sales elsewhere. The covenant, read in the light of the circumstances in which it was made, is one by which the purchaser agreed not to sell any other make of patterns while the contract was in force. The real question is: Does the contract of sale come within the third section of the Clayton Act, because the covenant not to sell the patterns of others 'may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly'?\n The Clayton Act, as its title and the history of its enactment discloses, was intended to supplement the purpose and effect of other anti- trust legislation, principally the Sherman Act of 1890 (Comp. St.  8820- 8823, 8827-8830). The latter act had been interpreted by this court to apply to contracts, combinations and conspiracies which unduly obstruct the free and natural flow of commerce. The construction since regarded as controlling was stated in the Standard Oil Case, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 58\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 502, 515 (55 L. Ed. 619, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 834. Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734 ), wherein this court construed the act as intended to reach combinations unduly restrictive of the flow of commerce or unduly restrictive of competition. It was said that the act embraced:\n'All contracts or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions, either from the nature or character of the contract or act or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing trade, but on the contrary were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals, thus restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring about the evils, such as enhancement of prices, which were considered to be against public policy.'\n\n See, also, United States v. American Tobacco \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 356]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n221 U.S. 106\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 632; United States v. St. Louis Terminal Co., \n224 U.S. 383\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 507; Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 U.S. 20\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 9; United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n226 U.S. 61\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 53; United States v. Reading Co., \n226 U.S. 324\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 90; Nash v. United States, \n229 U.S. 373\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 780; Straus v. American Pub. Ass'n \n231 U.S. 222\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 84, L. R. A. 1915A, 1099, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 369.\n As the Sherman Act was usually administered, when a case was made out, it resulted in a decree dissolving the combination, sometimes with unsatisfactory results so far as the purpose to maintain free competition was concerned.\n The Clayton Act sought to reach the agreements embraced within its sphere in their incipiency, and in the section under consideration to determine their legality by specifictests of its own which declared illegal contracts of sale made upon the agreement or understanding that the purchaser shall not deal in the goods of a competitor or competitors of the seller, which 'may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.'\n Much is said in the briefs concerning the reports of committees concerned with the enactment of this legislation, but the words of the act are plain and their meaning is apparent, without the necessity of resorting to the extraneous statements and often unsatisfactory aid of such reports. See Railroad Commission of Wisconsin et al. v. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co. (decided February 27, 1922) \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, and previous decisions of this court therein cited.\n Section 3 condemns sales or agreement where the effect of such sale or contract of sale 'may' be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create monopoly. It thus deals with consequences to follow the making of the restrictive covenant limiting the right of the purchaser to deal in the goods of the seller only. But we do not think that the purpose in using the word 'may' was to prohibit the mere possibility of the consequences described. \n\n[258 U.S. 346, 357]\n\u00a0\n It was intended to prevent such agreements as would under the circumstances disclosed probably lessen competition, or create an actual tendency to monopoly. That it was not intended to reach every remote lessening of competition is shown in the requirement that such lessening must be substantial.\n Both courts below found that the contract interpreted in the light of the circumstances surrounding the making of it was within the provisions of the Clayton Act as one which substantially lessened competition and tended to create monopoly. These courts put special stress upon the fact found that of 52,000 so-called pattern agencies in the entire country, the petitioner, or its holding company controlling it and two other pattern companies, approximately controlled two-fifths of such agencies. As the Circuit Court of Appeals, summarizing the matter, pertinently observed:\n'The restriction of each merchant to one pattern manufacturer must in hundreds, perhaps in thousands, of small communities amount to giving such single pattern manufacturer a monopoly of the business in such community. Even in the larger cities, to limit to a single pattern maker the pattern business of dealers most resorted to by customers whose purchases tend to give fashions their vogue, may tend to facilitate further combinations; so that the plaintiff, or some other aggressive concern, instead of controlling two-fifths, will shortly have almost, if not quite, all the pattern business.'\n\n We agree with these conclusions, and have no doubt that the contract, properly interpreted, with its restrictive covenant, brings it fairly within the section of the Clayton Act under consideration.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF STATE OF NEW YORK v. NORDENHOLT(1922)\nNo. 625\nArgued: March 9, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, Deputy Atty. Gen., of New York, for petitioner.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. C. Sherwood, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sebastiana Insana, mother of Guiseppe Insana, asked of the New York State Industrial Commission an allowance under the Workmen's Compensation Law (Consol. Laws, c. 67) on account of her son's death, which she claimed resulted from accidental injuries received May 15, 1918, in the course of his employment as a longshoreman by the Nordenholt Corporation \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n then unloading a vessel lying in navigable waters at Brooklyn. The cargo consisted of bags of cement. These were hoisted to the dock and there tiered up by Insana and other longshoremen. While thus engaged, he slipped and fell on the dock.\n The Commission found 'the accidental injuries which the said deceased sustained while working for his employer when he fell from the pile of bags to the floor were the activating cause of his death, and his death was a direct result of the injuries sustained by him while engaged in the regular course of his employment,' and awarded compensation as specified by the statute. Upon authority of Matter of Keator v. Rock Plaster Manufacturing Co., 224 N. Y. 540, 120 N. E. 56, and Matter of Anderson v. Johnson Lighterage Co., 224 N. Y. 539, 120 N. E. 55, the Appellate Division reversed the award (Insana v. Nordenholt Corporation, 195 App. Div. 913, 185 N. Y. Supp. 933), and the Court of Appeals affirmed its action, without opinion, October 25, 1921 (232 N. Y. 507, 134 N. E. 549).\n In both the Matter of Keator and of Anderson, the employee suffered injuries on land while helping to unload a vessel lying in navigable waters. The Court of Appeals held, when so injured, he was performing a maritime contract, and that for reasons stated in Matter of Doey v. Howland Co., Inc., 224 N. Y. 30, 120 N. E. 53, the Industrial Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award. While making repairs on an oceangoing vessel lying at the dock in navigable waters, Doey fell down the hatchway and sustained fatal injuries. The Appellate Division reversed an award of compensation, and the Court of Appeals affirmed its action, holding that, as Doey was performing a maritime contract, the Commission had no jurisdiction, under the doctrine of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, and Clyde Steamship Co. v. Walker, \n244 U.S. 255\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 545. It said:\n'Two questions are presented: (a) Was Doey, at the time of his death, engaged in the performance of a maritime contract? ... \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n 'If the first question be answered in the affirmative, then it necessarily follows, from the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States above referred to [Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, and Clyde Steamship Co. v. Walker], that the commission had no authority to make the award in question. In determining whether a contract be of maritime nature, locality is not controlling, since the true test is the subject-matter of the contract-the nature and character of the work to be done. Erie R. R. Co. v. Welsh, \n242 U.S. 303\n. In torts the rule is different. There, jurisdiction depends solely upon the place where the tort was committed, which must have been upon the high seas or other navigable waters. Atlantic Transport Co. of W. Va. v. Imbrovek, \n234 U.S. 52\n. An award under the Workmen's Compensation Law is not made on the theory that a tort has been committed; on the contrary, it is upon the theory that the statute giving the commission power to make an award is read into and becomes a part of the contract. Matter of Post v. Burger & Gohlke, 216 N. Y. 544. The contract of employment, by virtue of the statute, contains an implied provision that the employer, if the employee be injured, will pay to him a certain sum to compensate for the injuries sustained, or if death results, a certain sum to dependents. These payments are made irrespective of whether or not the employer was guilty of wrongdoing. It is a part of the compensation agreed to be paid for services rendered in the course of the employment.\n\n'In the present case, upon the conceded facts, I am of the opinion that Doey was, at the time he met his death, engaged in the performance of a maritime contract. His employer had taken a contract to repair an ocean-going vessel, preparatory to its taking on a cargo of grain. Doey was one of several carpenters employed to make the necessary changes. He was, at the time he was killed, engaged in such work on a steamship then in navigable waters. \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 272]\n\u00a0\n The contract to make the changes was certainly maritime in its nature. Preparing a steamship to receive a cargo is as much maritime in nature as putting the cargo on or taking it from the ship. Nor was the nature of the contract changed in any way because the contractor did not actually do the work himself, but employed others to do it for him. Doey's contract of employment was just as much of a maritime nature as was that of his employer. ...'\n\n An award to Newham, injured on the dock while checking freight and doing work similar to that of a foreman of stevedores was set aside in Newham v. Chile Exploration Co., 232 N. Y. 37, 133 N. E. 120 (October 18, 1921). The court said:\n'We have held in Matter of Doey v. Howland Co., 224 N. Y. 30, and in Matter of Anderson v. Johnson Lighterage Co., 224 N. Y. 539, and in Matter of Keator v. Rock Plaster Manufacturing Co., 224 N. U. 540, that, if the employee was engaged at the time of his injury in the performance of a maritime contract, the state did not have jurisdiction of the matter, and the Workmen's Compensation Law did not apply. This is the deduction which we have made from the cases of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n.'\n\n The court below has made deductions from Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, Clyde Steamship Co. v. Walker, and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, which we think are unwarranted, and has proceeded upon an erroneous view of the federal law.\n When an employee working on board a vessel in navigable waters, sustains personal injuries there, and seeks damages from the employer, the applicable legal principles are very different from those which would control if he had been injured on land while unloading the vessel. In the former situation the liability of employer must be determined under the maritime law; in the latter, no \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 273]\n\u00a0\n general maritime rule prescribes the liability, and the local law has always been applied. The liability of the employer for damages on account of injuries received on shipboard by an employee under a maritime contract is matter within the admiralty jurisdiction; but not so when the accident occurs on land.\n The injuries out of which Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen arose occurred on navigable waters, and the consequent rights and liabilities of the parties were prescribed by the maritime law. The question there was whether these rules could be superseded by the workmen's compensation statute of the state, and this court held they could not. In the opinion, citing Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1157, we said:\n'The work of a stevedore in which the deceased [Jensen] was engaging is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries which he received were likewise maritime; and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction.'\n\n The doctrine that locality is the exclusive test of admiralty jurisdiction in matters of tort had been questioned in the Imbrovek Case, and to show beyond any doubt that the maritime rules applied as to Jensen's injuries, we used the quoted language. Later, in Grant Smith- Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde (January 3, 1922) \n257 U.S. 469\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 157, we said:\n'The general doctrine that in contract matters admiralty jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the transaction and in tort matters upon the locality, has been so frequently asserted by this court that it must now be treated as settled.'\n\n In Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 382\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 501, 503 (62 L. Ed. 1171)-an action at law seeking full indemnity for injuries received by a sailor on shipboard-this was said:\n'The work about which petitioner was engaged is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries received were likewise maritime and the \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 274]\n\u00a0\n parties' rights and liabilities were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transportation Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S.. And unless in some way there was imposed upon the owners a liability different from that prescribed by maritime law, petitioner could properly demand only wages, maintenance and cure. Under the doctrine approved in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, no state has power to abolish the well recognized maritime rule concerning measure of recovery and substitute stitute therefor the full indemnity rule of the common law. Such a substitution would distinctly and definitely change or add to the settled maritime law; and it would be destructive of the 'uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.\"\n\n See, also, Peters v. Veasey, \n251 U.S. 121\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 65; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145\n\n\n In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 U.S. 308\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 112, it was held that when entering into maritime contracts the parties contemplate the system of maritime law, and its well-known rules control their rights and liabilities to the exclusion of state statutes.\n In Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia (December 5, 1921) \n257 U.S. 233\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 89, it was held that where a stevedore's death on a ship within the state resulted from injuries there received, an admiralty court, in the absence of federal statute or positive maritime rule, would recognize and apply the state statute giving an action for damages on account of death.\n'The subject is maritime and local in character and the specified modification of or supplement to the rule applied in admiralty courts when following the common law, will not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, nor interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.' \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 275]\n\u00a0\n In Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rhode, a carpenter proceeding in admiralty sought damages for injuries received while at work on a partially completed vessel lying in the Willamette river. The Oregon Workmen's Compensation Law prescribed an exclusive remedy, and the question presented was whether to give it effect would work material prejudice to the general maritime law. The accident occurred on navigable waters and the cause was of a kind ordinarily within the admiralty jurisdiction. Neither the general employment contracted for nor the workman's activities at the time had any direct relation to navigation or commerce-it was essentially a local matter-and we said:\n\n'Under such circumstances regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule would not necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations. ...\n\n'In Western Fuel Company v. Garcia we recently pointed out that as to certain local matters regulation of which would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, the rules of the latter might be modified or supplemented by state statutes. The present case is controlled by that principle. The statute of the state applies and defines the rights and liabilities of the parties. The employee may assert his claim against the industrial accident fund, to which both he and the employer have contributed as provided by the statute, but he cannot recover damages in an admiralty court.'\n\n Insana was injured upon the dock, an extension of the land (Cleveland, etc., R. R. Co. v. Cleveland S. S. Co., \n208 U.S. 316\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 414, 13 Ann. Cas. 1215), and certainly prior to the Workmen's Compensation Act the employer's liability for damages would have depended upon the common law and the \n\n[259 U.S. 263, 276]\n\u00a0\n state statutes. Consequently, when the Compensation Act superseded other state laws touching the liability in question, it did not come into conflict with any superior maritime law. And this is true whether awards under the act are made as upon implied agreements or otherwise. The stevedore's contract of employment did not contemplate any dominant federal rule concerning the master's liability for personal injuries received on land. In Jensen's Case, rights and liabilities were definitely fixed by maritime rules, whose uniformity was essential. With these the local law came into conflict. Here no such antagonism exists. There is no pertinent federal statute; and application of the local law will not work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law. Compare New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF GEORGIA v.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA(1922)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: January 30, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 516, 517]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas F. Green, of Athens, Ga., George M. Napier, of Atlanta, Ga., Clifford Walker, of Monroe, Ga., and Graham Wright, of Rome, Ga., for complainant.\n Messrs. Samuel M. Wolfe, Atty. Gen., and A. M. Lumpkin, of Columbia, S. C., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The parties to this case agree: That the boundary line between the states of Georgia and South Carolina is the river Savannah from the sea to the junction of the Seneca (formerly Keowee) and the Tugaloo (formerly spelled Tugalo) rivers; that it continues thence northwesterly by the Tugaloo river to the junction of the Tallulah and Chattooga rivers, and thence by the Chattooga river to the 35th parallel of north latitude, which is the south boundary of North Carolina. But they differ as to the location of the boundary line in these three rivers, and the state of Georgia, by original bill, prays that the controversy be settled by a decree of this court.\n The state of Georgia contends: That where there are no islands in the rivers, the line between the two states is midway between the river banks, when the water is at its ordinary stage; that where there are islands, this line deflects and follows the middle line of the most northerly branch or stream, where it runs between any island and the South Carolina shore; and it claims jurisdiction over all islands in all three boundary rivers.\n South Carolina, on the other hand, admits in its answer that where there are no islands the line between the states is the 'middle thread of the stream where the rivers flow \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n in one stream or volume,' but at the bar and in its brief it is argued, strenuously, that the true line is the low-water mark on the southerly or Georgia bank of each river. It also claims that where there are islands the line is at low-water mark on the southerly bank of the most northerly stream or branch of the river, and, while conceding all the islands in the rivers Savannah and Tugaloo to Georgia, it denies the jurisdiction of that state over those in the Chattooga river.\n Thus it will be seen that the controversy is limited to the determination: (1) Whether the boundary line shall be located midway between the banks of each river where there are no islands, or at low- water mark on the Georgia shore; (2) whether the location of the boundary line where there are islands in the rivers, is in the middle of the stream running between any island and the South Carolina shore, or at low-water mark on the southern or island shore of such stream; and (3) whether any islands there may be in the Chattooga river are within the territorial jurisdiction of Georgia.\n The taxation of dams and hydroelectric plants, already constructed and hereafter to be constructed, in the boundary rivers, renders the decision of the questions involved of importance to the two states.\n It is not necessary to recite or discuss the historic origin of the titles which the two contending states have to the territory comprised within their present boundaries, for it is stipulated that the rights of the parties are to be determined by the construction of the terms of a written convention or treaty, entered into on April 28, 1787, by commissioners appointed by the two states. This convention, entered into pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Confederation of 1778, under which the states were then united for the purposes of government, having been executed at Beaufort, S. C., is designated in the record as the Beaufort Convention. \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n Only two articles of this convention need be considered, and they are as follows:\n'Art. I. The most northern branch or stream of the river Savannah, from the sea or mouth of such stream to the fork or confluence of the rivers now called Tugalo and Keowee; and from thence, the most northern branch or stream of the said river Tugalo, till it intersects the northern boundary line of South Carolina, if the said branch or stream of Tugalo extends so far north, reserving all the islands in the said rivers Savannah and Tugalo to Georgia; but if the head spring or source of any branch or stream of the said river Tugalo does not extend to the north boundary line of South Carolina, then a west line to the Mississippi, to be drawn from the head spring or source of the said branch or stream of Tugalo river, which extends to the highest northern latitude, shall for ever hereafter form the separation limits and boundary between the states of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\n'Art. II. The navigation of the river Savannah at and from the bar and mouth, along the northeast side of Cockspur Island, and up the direct course of the main northern channel along the north side of Hutchinson's Island, opposite the town of Savannah, to the upper end of said island, and from thence up the bed or principal stream of the said river to the confluence of the rivers Tugalo and Keowee, and from the confluence up the channel of the most northern stream of Tugalo river to its source, and back again by the same channel to the Atlantic Ocean-is hereby declared to be henceforth equally free to the citizens of both states, and exempt from all duties, tolls, hindrance, interruption, and molestation whatsoever, attempted to be enforced by one state on the citizens of another; and all the rest of the river Savannah to the southward of the foregoing description is acknowledged to be the exclusive right of the state of Georgia.'\n\n First. As to the location of the line where there are no islands. While the admission quoted from the answer of \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 520]\n\u00a0\n South Carolina would be sufficient to justify locating the line, where there are no islands, in the 'middle thread of the stream where the river flows in one stream or volume,' nevertheless the earnestness with which the contention for the low-water mark on the Georgia shore is argued constrains us to consider the question further.\n That the admission in the answer was not made inadvertently is conclusively shown by the fact that the General Assembly of South Carolina, in 1852, by resolution, appearing in the record, declared: That the Beaufort Convention defines the boundary between the two states; that the terms of the first article of that convention 'construed by the undisputed principles of international and common law, fix as the limit of the respective jurisdictions of the two states ... the thread or middle of the most northern branch or stream of the rivers Savannah and Tugaloo, where these rivers have more than one branch or stream, and the thread or middle of these rivers where there is but one branch or stream,' and that the courts, the legislature and the departments of the government of the state have uniformly given to and acquiesced in this construction of the convention.\n A like declaration appears in the 'Code of the State Laws of the State of South Carolina,' adopted in 1861, in which the line where there are no islands is described as located at the 'middle thread of the stream where the river flows in one stream or volume.'\n With this construction of article I of the convention, by the courts, General Assembly, and heads of departments of South Carolina, we fully agree.\n The express reservation of the islands to Georgia and the placing of the boundary line in the most northerly branch of the Savannah and then of the Tugaloo river up to the 'northern boundary of South Carolina,' makes it clear that where there are islands in the river the line must be between them and the South Carolina shore, for \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 521]\n\u00a0\n otherwise the Georgia islands would be within the state of South Carolina. While it is true that the line, where there are no islands, is not specifically located by the convention at the 'thread or middle of the stream,' neither is it, in terms, placed at the low-water mark on the Georgia bank. However, the general rule is that where a river, navigable or nonnavigable, is the boundary between two states and the navigable channel is not involved, in the absence of convention or controlling circumstances to the contrary, each takes to the middle of the stream ( Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, 379; Hall, International Law [6th Ed.] 123; Creasy First Platform of International Law,  231), and therefore in this case the conclusion of the General Assembly of South Carolina in 1852 and in 1861, as we have quoted it, was clearly the correct one.\n We conclude that where, in any of the boundary rivers here involved, there are no islands the location of the boundary line between the two states is the thread of the river-the middle line of the stream-regardless of the channel of navigation, the precise location to be determined when the water is at its ordinary stage, 'neither swollen by freshets nor shrunk by drought.' Trustees of Hopkins Academy v. Dickinson, 9 Cush. ( Mass.) 544, 552.\n Second. As to the location of the boundary line 'where the most northern branch or stream' flows between an island or islands and the South Carolina shore.\n Obviously such a stream may be wide and deep and may contain the navigable channel of the river, or it may be narrow and shallow and insignificant in comparison with the adjacent parts of the river. But such variety of conditions cannot affect the location of the boundary line in this case, because, by article II of the convention, equal and unrestricted right to navigate the boundary rivers is secured to the citizens of each state, irrespective of the location of the navigable channel with respect to the boundary line. \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 522]\n\u00a0\n Thus, article II takes out of the case any influence which the thalweg, or main navigable channel, doctrine (Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 169\n, 170 S., 171, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258) might otherwise have had upon the interpretation to be placed on article I, by which the location of the line must be determined, and leaves the uncomplicated case of a boundary stream between two states quite unaffected by other considerations.\n Thus again we have the case of a stream for a boundary between two states and with the precise location of the boundary line unaffected by the thalweg doctrine, or by other circumstances, and again the rule must be applied that the division line is midway between the banks of the stream-here between the island bank on the one side and the South Carolina bank on the other-its precise position to be determined when the water is at its ordinary stage.\n Third. As to the islands in the Chattooga river:\n Article I, as quoted, makes it plain that the commissioners executing the Convention of Beaufort intended to provide that the most northern branch of the river which they knew as the Tugaloo, as far northerly as its intersection with the northern boundary of South Carolina, if it extended so far north, should be the boundary line between the two states. It is now known that the most northern branch of that river extends as far north as the south boundary line of North Carolina (the 35th parallel of north latitude) and beyond that the controversy in this case does not extend. The fact that this 'most northerly branch or stream of the Tugalo' has come to be known as the Chattooga in that part of it northerly of the junction of the rivers now know as the Tullulah and Chattooga, neither of which appears by this record to have been known or named at the time the convention was executed, cannot change the rights of the parties to the convention, in the islands in that part of \n\n[257 U.S. 516, 523]\n\u00a0\n the stream. The Chattooga is but the extension of the Tugaloo-the northern branch or stream of that river-and the fact that it is called Chattooga cannot affect the jurisdiction of Georgia over 'all of the islands in the said rivers Savannah and Tugaloo,' to which state they are specifically reserved by the convention. The islands in the Chattooga river, as well as those in the Savannah and Tugaloo, were reserved to Georgia by the convention.\n Thus we conclude: (1) Where there are no islands in the boundary rivers the location of the line between the two states is on the water midway between the main banks of the river when the water is at ordinary stage; (2) where there are islands the line is midway between the island bank and the South Carolina shore when the water is at ordinary stage; and ( 3) that islands in the Chattooga river are reserved to Georgia as completely as are those in the Savannah or Tugaloo rivers.\n Counsel may present a decree, within 30 days, to carry into effect these conclusions of the court, with or without a commission to locate and monument the boundary line as they may be advised. The costs of suit will be equally divided between the two states. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NEW YORK v. U S, .(1922)\nNo. 283\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 591, 592]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward G. Griffin, of Albany, N. Y., for appellants.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 591, 597]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter C. Noyes, of New York City, Alfred P. Thom, of Washington, D. C., Richard W. Barrett and George F. Brownell, both of New York City, P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., William S. Jenney and C. L. Andrus, both of New York City, for appellees Railroads.\n Mr. John E. Benton, of Washington, D. C., for 45 States, amici curiae.\n Mr. Patrick J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a bill in equity against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission and others brought by the State of New York and its Attorney General to annuland enjoin the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission requiring the interstate railroads operating in intrastate commerce in the State of New York to charge in such commerce 3.6 cents a mile for all passengers, 20 per cent. increase over the then excess baggage rates to intrastate passengers, a surcharge of 50 per cent. of the charges for space in sleeping cars \n\n[257 U.S. 591, 598]\n\u00a0\n to such passengers, and 20 per cent. increase in intrastate rates on milk, all for the purpose of bringing the intrastate rates to the level of the interstate rates previously fixed by the Commission. The bill was filed under, and by virtue of, the statute repealing the Commerce Court Act and conferring jurisdiction on the District Court. 38 Stat. 219. The application for an interlocutory injunction was heard by a Circuit Judge and two District Judges. Then a final hearing was had, and the court entered a final decree dismissing the complaint from which this appeal has been taken. The railroad companies affected by the order were on their petition permitted to intervene, and are here as appellees.\n It appears from the record that in the proceeding by the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix interstate commerce rates to comply with the requirements of section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by section 422 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 488-a proceeding known as Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 220-the Commission, after conference with a committee representing all the state commerce commissions ana authorities authorized the group of intrastate railroads, of which the railroads operating in New York were a part, to raise their freight rates 40 per cent., their passenger rates and excess baggage charges 20 per cent., and to add a surcharge of 50 per cent. for passengers on sleeping cars. As soon as the order in Ex parte 74 was made, the railroads concerned applied to the Public Service Commission of the State of New York for similar increases in intrastate rates. That Commission granted the increase in freight rates, but denied it as to milk rates and passenger fares. The passenger intrastate fares were 3 cents a mile under the order of the President during the war control, but when that should become ineffective, a statute of New York fixing passenger fares on the New York Central Railroad from albany to Buffalo at two \n\n[257 U.S. 591, 599]\n\u00a0\n cents a mile would come into force and operation. As soon as the state commission made its ruling, the railroads applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 13 of the act of which proceeding notice was given to the state of New York, the Attorney General and the Public Service Commission, all of whom appeared, for an order directing the railroads to put intrastate passenger fares, excess baggage charges, sleeping car surtaxes and milk rates on the same level with interstate rates. Proof was offered by the railways to show that conditions of operation in state and interstate passenger traffic were alike and there was no showing otherwise. The record in Ex parte 74 was put in evidence. There was evidence also to show that at Buffalo and other border points the difference between the interstate and intrastate fares would divert business from the interstate lines between New York City and Buffalo to the New York Central lines, and that the same difference would break up interstate journeys to the west into intrastate journeys to Buffalo from New York and an interstate journey beyond, thus reducing interstate travel and discriminating against passengers carried therein. Evidence was adduced to show the injury to interstate business in the transportation of milk from the country to New York City from points outside of the state in competition with intrastate traffic in this necessity of life. No investigation was made into suburban commuter travel and it is excluded by the Commission from the scope of the order which it made. The order was state wide in its effect and required all interstate carriers to bring their intrastate milk rates, their intrastate passenger fares except commuters' rates, excess baggage charges and sleeping car surcharges to a level with interstate fares and rates as ordered in Ex parte 74. The Commission introduced a saving clause in its findings by which the New York authorities or any other interested parties were given leave to apply for modification of its order or \n\n[257 U.S. 591, 600]\n\u00a0\n findings as to any intrastate fares, charges or rates included therein on the ground that the latter were not related to interstate fares, charges or rates in such a way as to contravene the provisions of the Interstate Commission Act. Under this clause, at least one petition has been filed by a railroad and the railroad excepted from the order.\n The District Court dismissed the bill.\n This case differs from the Wisconsin Rate Case, \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, just decided, in that it is a direct proceeding to annul or set aside the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission Complained of, brought against the United States and the Commission under the statute. Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 U.S. 557\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 375. The Wisconsin Case was a suit by a railroad against the state authorities to prevent the latter from penalizing the railroad for complying with the order of the Commission. To this suit the United States and the Commission were not parties. The defense of the state authorities was a collateral attack upon the order, to prevail in which they were obliged to show that the order was void on the face of the findings without regard to the evidence or the absence of it. In the case before us, the complainants are entitled to rely on the absence of any substantial evidence to sustain a material finding as a basis for attacking the order.\n The first objection of the appellants is that there was no sufficient evidence of discrimination against persons and localities under section 13, par. 4,  416, of the Transportation Act of 1920, to justify a state-wide order of the kind here made. We have considered this objection in the Wisconsin Case on a similar showing on the findings. Here we consider it on the evidence. We reach the same conclusion here and sustain the objection.\n The next objection is that the state has a charter contract with the New York Central Railroad Company by \n\n[257 U.S. 591, 601]\n\u00a0\n which the latter is bound not to charge more than two cents a mile for passenger carriage between Albany and Buffalo, and that if the Transportation Act permits the Interstate Commerce Commission by such an order to enable the railroad company to violate its contract, it impairs the obligation of a contract in violation of section 10, article 1, of the Federal Constitution. That section provides that 'no state shall ... pass a law ... impairing the obligation of contracts' and does not in terms restrict Congress or the United States.\n But it is said that it deprives New York and her people of property without due process of law. We said in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 230\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 96, 103 (44 L. Ed. 136):\n'Anything which directly obstructs and thus regulates that commerce which is carried on among the states, whether it is state legislation or private contracts between individuals or corporations should be subject to the power of Congress in the regulation of that commerce.' Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671.\n\n See also, Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 \nU.S. 141, 162\n, 163 S., 21 Sup. Ct. 48; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 400\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 367.\n The main objections to the order are the same as those presented, considered and overruled in the Wisconsin Rate Case, just decided. The evidence in this case shows that if the passenger and other rates here in controversy were to continue in force as ruled by the Public Service Commission of New York, the annual gross revenues of the interstate railroads operating in the State of New York from both interstate and intrastate passenger and milk business would be less by nearly twelve millions of dollars than those revenues if the intrastate fares and rates were on the same level as the interstate rates as fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. If the lower level of intrastate fares and rates is to be maintained, it will discriminate against interstate commerce, in that it will require higher fares and rates in the interstate commerce of \n\n[257 U.S. 591, 602]\n\u00a0\n the state to secure the income of which the Interstate Commerce Commission must attempt to provide by fixing rates under section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 422 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 488, in carrying out the declared congressional purpose 'to provide the people of the United States with adequate transportation.' As we have just held in the Wisconsin Case, this constitutes 'undue, unreasonable and unjust discrimination against interstate commerce,' which is declared to be unlawful and prohibited by section 13, par. 4, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by section 416 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 484, and which the Interstate Commerce Commission is authorized therein to remove by fixing intrastate rates for the purpose. We need not repeat our reasons for our ruling. Nor need we consider and give again the grounds upon which we hold section 13, par. 4, as thus construed to be valid under the Constitution of the United States.\n The decree of the District Court dismissing the bill of complaint is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NORTH DAKOTA EX REL LEMKE v. CHICAGO & N W RY. CO.(1922)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: January 23, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 485, 486]\n\u00a0\n Charles W. Bunn, of St. Paul, Minn., for defendants.\n Karl Knox Gartner, of Washington, D. C., for complainant.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought in this Court by the State of North Dakota against certain named railroad companies to prevent their applying an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission until this Court can review the decision upon which that order was made. The order increased the intrastate rates in North Dakota upon a finding that the present rates were an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce within the meaning of paragraph 4 of section 13 of the Act to regulate commerce as amended by the Transportation Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, title IV,  416, 41 Stat. 456, 484. North Dakota Rates, Fares and Charges, 61 Interst. Com. Com'n, 504; Increased Rates, 1920, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n, 220. The ground of the bill is that the increase if applied will make the jobbing business within the State unable to compete with the \n\n[257 U.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n jobbers of Minnesota, and that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission is invalid (1) because based upon an increase in interstate rates that the Commission ordered without complying with the conditions said to be imposed by section 15a as added by Act 1920 (41 Stat. 488) and section 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act-Comp. St.  8591-(a physical valuation;) (2) and because based upon a misconstruction of the above mentioned section 13(4). In is not necessary to state the objections more at length.\n The defendants move to dismiss the bill. The first reason offered is that a State cannot sue on account of the private grievances of its citizens. By an amendment the State alleged a property interest in itself but that amendment did not cover the extent of the relief asked, and the case is argued on the broad ground originally taken. We shall leave this question on one side, without deciding whether this case can be distinguished from Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe By. Co., \n220 U.S. 277\n, 286, et seq., 31 Sup. Ct. 434. The argument that we shall consider is that the suit is one to set aside or suspend the order of the Commission, Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 U.S. 493\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 170; that therefore by section 211 of the Judicial Code the United States must be made a party, and that the United States has consented to be sued only in the District Court, where such suits are required to be brought. Judicial Code,  208; Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32; 38 Stat. 219.\n The State replies in the first place that the sections of the Judicial Code relied upon relate to the establishment of the Commerce Court and therefore are repealed in terms by the Act of October 22, 1913, just referred to. But that argument cannot be maintained. A provision that all suits of a certain sort shall be brought in the Commerce Court is only modified, not repealed, by the abolition of the Court and the transfer of its jurisdiction to the District Courts. Such a state does not relate merely to the establishment of the Commerce Court. The \n\n[257 U.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n sections cited always have been assumed, we believe, to remain in force and they were made a basis of decision in Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 504\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 170.\n The main contention of the State is that if in the opinion of the Court it has a substantial right that is infringed by what the defendants are doing Congress neither can take that right away nor prevent the State from proceeding in this Court for such remedy as law or equity may afford. But if these premises were granted, it would not follow that the bill should be maintained. It is a proceeding in equity in which the requirements of complete justice and of public policy must be taken into account. When they are considered it seems to us pretty clear that the State should be remitted to the remedy offered by the statutes-a suit in the District Court in which the United States is made a party. Complete justice require that the railroads should not be subjected to the risk of two irreconcilable commands-that of the Interstate Commerce Commission enforced by a decree on the one side and that of this court on the other. The decision in this case although an authority would not be res judicata, and the Commission would not be concluded from rearguing the whole matter. As to public policy, Congress has indicated the policy of the United States. For although it is argued that the requirement that the United States should be made a party is a mere matter of procedure for the purpose of giving the Department of Justice control, we cannot limit the significance of the Judicial Code,  211, by such a speculation. The language of the section shows that public interests were before the mind of Congress, and that in its opinion an order made in the public interest should not be hindered from going into effect until the representative of the public had been heard. It appears to us that this view is so reasonable that it should be accepted by this Court even if not bound. \n\n[257 U.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n There is no doubt that a state can sue in the District Court when the United States is a party and has consented to be sued there and has not expressed its consent to be sued elsewhere. United States v. Louisiana, \n123 U.S. 32\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 17; Ames v. Kansas, \n111 U.S. 449\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 437. For the reasons that we have indicated it is equitable that a decree should not be entered except in such form as to bind the Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States and therefore this bill must be dismissed. The right of the State is sufficiently protected by its right to appeal from the decision of the District Court. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 395, et seq..\n Bill dismissed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OHIO EX REL SENEY v. SWIFT & CO(1922)\nNo. 67\nArgued: October 16, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Allen J. Seney and Charles S. Northup, both of Toledo, Ohio, for appellant. \n\n[260 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold W. Fraser, of Toledo, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Styling himself the plaintiff, and declaring that he proceeded officially on behalf of the state, Allen J. Seney, prosecuting attorney, instituted the original proceeding against Swift & Co. and the Northern Refrigerating Company, in the court of common pleas for Lucas county, Ohio. He charged that those companies were parties to certain agreements and transactions in respect of stored pork products denounced by the Valentine Anti-Trust Law (Gen. Code Ohio,  6390-6402) and the Smith Cold Storage Law (107 Ohio Laws, p. 594), and prayed for an order restraining delivery of the products to Swift & Co., for a receiver, and for an injunction forbidding further unlawful acts.\n In due time, alleging that the controversy was solely between it and Allen J. Seney, prosecuting attorney, and complete determination could be had without the presence of the Northern Refrigerating Company, Swift & Co. asked removal of the cause to the United States \n\n[260 U.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n District Court. Shortly stated, the petition set up the following grounds:\n\n 1. \nThe controversy is controlled by, and necessarily involves, the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n\n 2. \nDefendant cannot enforce, in the judicial tribunals of Ohio, its equal civil rights as a citizen of the United States.\n\n 3. \nThe parties are citizens of different states.\n Swift & Co. filed the record in the District Court, and later presented an answer and cross-petition. Upon the claim that the cause was not removable and the District Court lacked jurisdiction, the relator moved to remand to the state court on the record as it then stood, and neither party offered affidavits or other evidence in support of or in opposition thereto. This motion being overruled, he refused to litigate the merits. Thereafter evidence was introduced to show that the pork was in interstate transportation, resting under a storage in transit privilege, and had never been intended for sale in Ohio. A final judgment dismissed the complaint. The court based its conclusion in part upon findings of an adequate affirmative defense.\n The relator appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where he relied wholly upon the jurisdictional question. That court said, 'The only question ... now in controversy in this court is whether the court below acquired jurisdiction by the petition for removal,' but ruled that the final decree appealed from involved something more than jurisdiction, and sustained the appeal. It considered the three specified grounds for removal, held the first and second unsubstantial, the third sufficient, and affirmed the trial court. 270 Fed. 141. Thereupon this appeal was taken, and the relator again seeks to present the single question upon which he relied below.\n After final judgment in the District Court, other defenses being waived, the cause might have come here by direct appeal upon the jurisdictional question only \n\n[260 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n (Wilson v. Republic Iron & Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 92, 96\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 35); but other matters were involved which could have been reviewed. He chose to go to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and there assailed the removal and nothing more.\n The District Court's jurisdiction depended upon the substantial grounds alleged in the petition for removal. Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n245 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 364 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 130. Without traversing the facts alleged therein, the relator has always maintained that none of such grounds was good. The Circuit Court of Appeals adopted his views as to Nos. 1 and 2, supra, but declared the third-diversity of citizenship-a substantial one. Generally, at least, suitors may not maintain a position here which conflicts with that taken below; and the only point now open, in any view, is that the claim of diverse citizenship lacks substantiality. Wilson v. Republic Iron & Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 92, 97\n, 98 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 35. The court below, upon full consideration, rejected this contention.\n Section 128, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120), provides that Circuit Courts of Appeals shall exercise appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of District Courts in all classes of cases except those wherein appeals and writs of error may be taken directly to the Supreme Court.1- \n\n[260 U.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n Section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), provides that appeals and writs of error may be taken from final judgments of the District Courts directly to the Supreme Court when jurisdiction of the court is in issue, in prize causes, cases involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, etc. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of March, 3, 1891, from which these sections take their origin, has been uniformly construed as intended to distribute jurisdiction among the appellate courts, prevent successive appeals, and relieve the docket of this court. If appellant, in the way now attempted, can secure two reviews of a cause wherein he has presented to the court below no controverted question except the jurisdictional one, a fundamental purpose of the statute will be frustrated.

The state of Texas answered the bill, and joined in the prayer that the controversy be decided. Shortly thereafter the United \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 579]\n\u00a0\n States, by the court's leave, intervened as a party in interest, and in its bill of intervention set up a claim to the river bed as against both states. Subsequent proceedings resulted in a decree recognizing and declaring that the true state boundary is along the south bank of the river, as claimed by Oklahoma and the United States, and not along the medial line of the stream, as claimed by Texas. \n256 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 420, and 65 L. Ed. 831, and \n256 U.S. 608\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 539. The decree directed a further hearing to determine what constitutes the south bank, where along that bank the boundary is, and the proper mode of locating it on the ground. That hearing was had last week and disclosed that the parties differ widely as to what constitutes the south bank. A decision on the question will be given after it shall have been fully considered. The southerly cut-bank to which we shall refer presently may or may not be the bank along which the boundary extends. On this we intimate no opinion now.\n Our present concern is with proprietary claims to the bed of the river and to the proceeds of oil and gas taken from 43 miles of the southerly half.\n After we acquired jurisdiction of the suit it developed that the state of Oklahoma was claiming title to the entire river bed from one bank to the other; that the state of Texas was claiming title to the southerly half; that the United States was disputing the claims of both states and asserting full proprietorship of the southerly half and an interest ( because of its relation to Indian allottees) in portions of the northerly half; that a part of the bed, particularly of the southerly half, had been but recently discovered to be underlaid with strata bearing oil and gas and to be of great value by reason thereof; that many persons were proceeding to drill for, extract and appropriate these minerals with uncertain regard for the dispute over the title and for the true ownership; that possession of parts of the bed was being taken and held by intimidation and force; that in suits for injunction the \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 580]\n\u00a0\n courts of both states were assuming jurisdiction over the same areas; that armed conflicts between rival aspirants for the oil and gas had been but narrowly averted and still were imminent; that the militia of Texas had been called to support the orders of its courts, and an effort was being made to have the militia of Oklahoma called for a like purpose; that these conflicting assertions of jurisdiction and the measures taken to sustain them were detrimental to the public tranquility, were of general concern and were likely to result in great waste of the oil and gas and in their extraction and appropriation to the irreparable injury of the true owner of the area in dispute, and that unless these minerals were secured and conserved by means of wells drilled and operated in that area there was danger that they would be drawn off through wells in adjacent territory pending the solution of the controversy over the state boundary and the title to the river bed.\n In these circumstances, on the motion of the United States, fully supported by the state of Oklahoma and expressly approved by the state of Taxas to the extent of its proprietary claim, we appointed a receiver to take possession of the part of the river bed between the medial line and a line on the south bank temporarily and provisionally designated, and within defined easterly and westerly limits, and to control or conduct all necessary oil and gas operations therein. As to that area there appeared to be urgent need for such action. The order provided in detail for ascertaining and holding the net proceeds of the oil and gas in such way that they could be awarded and paid to whoever ultimately should be found to be the rightful claimants, and also provided for such interventions in the suit as would permit all possible claims to the property and proceeds in the receiver's possession to be freely and appropriately asserted. \n252 U.S. 372\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 353. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 581]\n\u00a0\n Numerous parties have since intervened for the purpose of asserting rights to particular tracts in the receiver's possession and are seeking to have the same and the net proceeds of the oil and gas taken therefrom surrendered to them. Many of these claims conflict one with another and all are in conflict with the claims of one or more of the three principal litigants.\n Under the Constitution (article 3,  2), our original jurisdiction extends to suits by one state against another and to suits by the United States against a state. \n1\n In its first state this was a suit by one state against another. When the United States intervened it became also a suit by the United States against those states. In its enlarged phase it presents in appropriate form the conflicting claims of the two states and the United States to the river bed and calls for their adjudication. The other claims, being for particular tracts and funds in the receiver's possession and exclusively under our control, are brought before us because no other court lawfully can interfere with or disturb that possession or control. It long has been settled that claims to property or funds of which a court has taken possession and control through a receiver or like officer may be dealt with as ancillary to the suit wherein the possession is taken and the control exercised-and this although independent suits to enforce the claims could not be entertained in that court. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[258 U.S. 574, 582]\n\u00a0\n The decree recognizing and declaring that the boundary between the two states is along the south bank of the river, and not along its medial line, means that the entire river bed is within the state of Oklahoma and beyond the reach of the laws of the state of Texas, and therefore that the latter state and its grantees and licensees have no proprietary interest in the bed or in the proceeds of oil and gas taken therefrom. Of course, when the exact location of the boundary along the south bank is determined, it may develop that the receiver is holding some land on the southerly side of that line or proceeds arising therefrom, and, if so, the state of Texas and its grantees and licensees will be free to claim the same.\n The other claims are all such as may be examined without awaiting an exact location of the boundry. They may be grouped and designated as (a) those of the state of Oklahoma and its grantees and licensees, (b) that of the United States, (c) those of Indian allottees and others based on the ownership of riparian lands on the northerly side of the river, and (d) those based on placer mining locations made in the river bed. The evidence bearing on these claims was taken and reported under an order entered at the last term, \n256 U.S. 605\n, and the pertinent questions of fact and law have been recently presented in both oral and printed arguments.\n The Red river rises in the Panhandle of Texas, near the New Mexico boundary, and takes an easterly and southeasterly course to the Mississippi, of which it is a tributary. Its total length is about 1,300 miles. The first 557 miles from its mouth are in Louisiana and Arkansas, the next 539 miles are in Oklahoma along the southern boundary, and the remainder is in the Panhandle of Texas. The receivership area embraces 43 miles of the southerly half of the river bed and lies 409 miles up stream from the eastern boundary of Oklahoma. In that state the river bed between the cut-banks, so-called, has \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 583]\n\u00a0\n an average width of one-third of the mile, the least width being in the vicinity of the 100th meridian and the greatest in the vicinity of the receivership area.\n By the treaty of 1803 (8 Stat. 200) with France and that of 1819 (8 Stat. 252) with Spain the United States acquired the full title to the bed of the river within what now constitutes the state of Oklahoma and to the adjacent lands on the north, and it still is their proprietor, save as in the meantime the title to particular areas, or some beneficial interest therein, has passed or been transferred from it to others in virtue of the Constitution or some treaty or law made thereunder. Recognizing that this is so, the claimants, other than the United States, severally have assumed, as they should, the burden of showing that the rights in the river bed which they are asserting were mediately or immediately derived from the United States. Whether they have successfully carried this burden is the matter for decision.\n Oklahoma claims complete ownership of the entire bed of the river within that state, and in support of its claim contends that the river throughout its course in the state is navigable, and therefore that on the admission of the state into the Union, on November 16, 1907, the title to the river bed passed from the United States to the state in virtue of the constitutional rule of equality among the states whereby each new state becomes, as was each of the original states, the owner of the soil underlying the navigable waters within its borders. If that section of the river be navigable, its bed undoubtedly became the property of the state under that rule. \n3\n Those who oppose the state's claim recognize that this is so; and the state concedes that its claim is not tenable, if that section of the river be not navigable. So the real question in this connection is whether the river is navigable in Oklahoma.\n The state relies on the third article of the treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain (8 Stat. 252) \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 584]\n\u00a0\n as conclusively establishing the navigability of that section of the river. The article says:\n'The boundary line between the two countries, west of the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulph of Mexico, at the mouth of the river Sabine, in the sea, continuing north, along the western bank of that river, to the 32d degree of latitude; thence, by a line due north, to the degree of latitude where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Nachitoches, or Red river; then following the course of the Rio Roxo westward, to the degree of longitude 100 west from London and 23 from Washington; then, crossing the said Red river, and running thence, by a line due north, to the river Arkansas; thence, following the course of the southern bank of the Arkansas, to its source, in latitude 42 north; and thence, by that parallel of latitude, to the South Sea. The whole being as laid down in Melish's map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January, 1818. But, if the source of the Arkansas river shall be found to fall north or south of latitude 42 then the line shall run from the said source due south or north, as the case may be, till it meets the said parallel of latitude 42, and thence, along the said parallel, to the South Sea: All the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States; but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks, shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.'\n\n The state's reliance is on the concluding words, but we think it ill- founded. At the date of the treaty the Red and Arkansas rivers were in a general way known to be navigable in their lower reaches and not navigable in their upper reaches, but how far up the streams navigability extended was not known. Both were of great length, \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 585]\n\u00a0\n largely within a region occupied by wild Indians, and measurably unexplored. The words on which the state relies evidently were to apply alike to both streams. The international boundary was to run along the southerly banks of both,-along that of the Red for about 600 miles4 east of the 100th meridian and along that of the Arkansas from the same meridian to the source of that river in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. To attribute to the parties a purpose to impress this entire stretch of the Arkansas with a navigable character, regardless of the actual conditions, is, in our opinion, quite inadmissible. And so of the 600-mile stretch of the Red. The entire article, examined in the light of the circumstances in which the treaty was negotiated, shows, as we think, that what really was intended in this regard was to provide and make sure that the right to navigate these rivers wherever along the boundary they were navigable in fact, should be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.\n A legal inference of navigability is said to arise from the action of the surveying officers who, when surveying the lands in that region, ran a meander line along the northerly bank and did not extend the township and section lines across the river. But this has little significance. The same thing was done on the Platte and other large western streams known to be unnavigable. Besides, those officers were not clothed with power to settle questions of navigability. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n A like inference is sought to be drawn from the fact that Congress, in permitting the construction of certain bridges across the river within Oklahoma, provided in substance \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 586]\n\u00a0\n that there should be no interference with navigation. \n6\n But it is reasonably manifest that this provision was only precautionary and not intended as an affirmation of navigable capacity in that locality. The river was known to be navigable from its mouth to near the eastern boundary of Oklahoma, and there had been, as will be seen presently, some light navigation above that boundary in the irregular times of temporary high water; so those who were about to construct the bridges at large expense deemed it prudent to secure the permission of Congress, and Congress merely took the perfectly safe course of qualifying its permission as indicated.\n We find nothing in any of the matters relied on which takes the river on Oklahoma out of the settled rule in this country that navigability in fact is the test of navigability in law, and that whether a river is navigable in fact is to be determined by inquiring whether it is used, or is susceptible of being used, in its natural and ordinary condition as a highway for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The evidence bearing on this question is voluminous and in some respects conflicting. A large part of it deals directly with the physical characteristics of the river, comes from informed sources and is well in point. A small part consists of statements found in early publications, and repeated in some later ones, to the effect that the river is navigable for great distances,-some of them exceeding its entire length. These statements originated \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 587]\n\u00a0\n at a time when there were no reliable data on the subject, and were subsequently accepted and repeated without much concern for their accuracy. Of course, they and their repetition must yield to the actual situation as learned in recent years. \n8\n The evidence also discloses an occasional tendency to emphasize the exceptional conditions in times of temporary high water and to disregard the ordinary conditions prevailing throughout the greater part of the year. With this explanatory comment, we turn to the facts which we think the evidence establishes when it is all duly considered.\n The river has its source in the Staked Plains of Northwestern Texas, and from there until it gets well into Oklahoma is within a region where the rainfall is light, is confined to a relatively short period in each year and quickly finds its way into the river. Because of this the river in the western half of the state does not have a continuous or dependable volume of water. It has a fall of 3 feet or more per mile and for long intervals the greater part of its extensive bed is dry sand interspersed with irregular ribbons of shallow water and occasional deeper pools. Only for short intervals, when the rainfall is running off, are the volume and depth of the water such that even very small boats could be operated therein. During these rises the water is swift and turbulent and in rare instances overflows the adjacent land. The rises usually last from 1 to 7 days and in the aggregate seldom cover as much as 40 days in a year.\n In 1910 Capt. A. E. Waldron, of the Corps of Engineers, made an examination of this part of the river from the mouth of the Big Wichita eastward to the mouth of the Washita (185 1\/2 miles) pursuant to a congressional direction. From his report,9 fairly portraying the normal \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 588]\n\u00a0\n condition of that stretch of the stream, we extract the following:\n'5. The banks of the river are from onefourth to 1 1\/2 miles in width [ apart], and from 10 to 30 feet in height, with numerous high, rocky and clayey bluffs. In the bends of the river the banks cave badly except where the rocky and clayey bluffs occur. This caving causes a continual shifting of the river bed, which moves from one side of the valley to the other.\n\n'6. In places the channel is 1,000 feet wide, and has a depth of only about one-third of a foot. At other places, notably in the bends, it narrows down to a width of 30 feet with an increased depth.\n\n'7. The examination of the river was made from a flat bottom bateau drawing 5 1\/2 inches when loaded. There was not a single day during the field examination upon which it was not necessary to remove part of the load and drag the boat over sand bars from 300 to 1,000 feet in length. On some days this would occur very often.\n\n'8. The field work of examination was performed during the period from November 21 to December 19, 1910. During this period the river gauge at Denison, 11 miles below the mouth of the Washita river, ranged between zero and 1 foot. In reference to the gauge readings at the bridge near Denison, it might be well to state that there were only 42 days during the year 1910 on which this gauge read 2 feet or over, and only 81 days on which it read as much as 1 foot or over.\n\n'9. At three places during the trip down the river in the bateau, solid rock bottom was encountered, ranging from 300 to 1,200 feet in length, and having a depth of only fourtenths of a foot of water in the deepest place.'\n\n We regard it as obvious that in the western half of the state the river is not susceptible of being used in its natural and ordinary condition as a highway for commerce; and there is no evidence that in fact it ever was so used. That section embraces the receivership area. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 589]\n\u00a0\n Of course, the conditions along that part of the river greatly affect the part in the eastern half of the state. But the latter receives additional waters from the Washita and other tributaries and has a practically continuous flow of varying volume, the extreme variation between high and low water being about 30 feet. When the water rises it does so very rapidly, and it falls in the same way. The river bed has a fall of more than 1 foot to the mile and consists of light sand which is easily washed about and is carried down stream in great quantities at every rise of the water. At all times there is an almost continuous succession of shifting and extensive sand bars. Ordinarily the depth of water over the sand bars is from 6 to 18 inches and elsewhere from 3 to 6 feet. There is no permanent or stable channel. Such as there is shifts irregularly from one side of the bed to the other and not infrequently separates into two or three parts. Boats with a sufficient draft to be of any service can ascend and descend only during periods of high water. These periods are intermittent, of irregular and short duration, and confined to a few months in the year.\n Lanesport, Ark., which is near the Oklahoma boundary, has been the usual head of navigation; but for several years before railroads were extended into that section boats of light draft carried merchandise up the river to the mouth of the Kiamitia10 and other points in that vicinity and took out cotton and other products on the return trip. This occurred only in periods of high water, and was accomplished under difficulties. In very exceptional instances boats went to the mouth of the Washita,11 where some had to await the high water of the next season before they could return. When the railroads \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 590]\n\u00a0\n were constructed this high-water or flood navigation ceased. That was between 1875 and 1880\n\n\n According to many witnesses, whose knowledge of this part of the river reaches back for a long period, the depth of the water at ordinary stages has come to be less than it was from 1850 to 1870, when they first knew it. Portions of the banks have been swept away and sand in great quantities has been brought down stream, making the river wider and shallower than at the time of the navigation just mentioned.\n Beginning in 1886 Congress made several appropriations looking to the improvement of the river from a point in Arkansas, not far from the Oklahoma boundary, westward to the mouth of the Washita, and about $500, 000 was expended on the project. The officer in charge of the work several times recommended that it be discontinued, because not likely to result in any commercial navigation; and in 191612 that officer, the division engineer, the Board of Engineers and the Chief of Engineers concurred in recommending that the project be entirely abandoned, their reasons being that the small (high-water) commerce of an earlier period had disappeared; that the characteristics of the river rendered it impracticable to secure a useful channel except by canalization, the cost of which would be prohibitive; that the expenditures already made were practically useless, and that there was no reason to believe conditions would change in such way as to bring better results in the future. In 192113 that recommendation was repeated. No appropriations in furtherance of the project were made after 1916. Any inference of navigable capacity arising from the fact that this project was undertaken is much more than overcome by the actual conditions disclosed in the course of the work. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 591]\n\u00a0\n While the evidence relating to the part of the river in the eastern half of the state is not so conclusive against mavigability as that relating to the western section, we think it establishes that trade and travel neither do nor can move over that part of the river, in its natural and ordinary condition, according to the modes of trade and travel customary on water; in other words, that it is neither used, nor susceptible of being used, in its natural and ordinary condition as a highway for commerce. Its characteristics are such that its use for transportation has been and must be exceptional, and confined to the irregular and short periods of temporary high water. A greater capacity for practical and beneficial use in commerce is essential to establish navigability. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n A decision by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, in Hale v. Record, 44 Okl. 803, 146 Pac. 587, is relied on as adjudging that the river is navigable in fact. The opinion in the case is briefly to the effect that in the trial court the evidence was conflicting, that the conflict was there resolved on the side of navigability, and that this finding had reasonable support in the evidence and therefore could not be disturbed. It was a purely private litigation. The United States was not a party and is not bound. \n15\n There is in the opinion no statement of the evidence, so the decision hardly can be dregarded as persuasive here.\n We conclude that no part of the river within Oklahoma is navigable, and therefore that the title to the bed did not pass to the state on its admission into the Union. If the state has a lawful claim to any part of the bed, it is only such as may be incidental to its ownership of riparian \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 592]\n\u00a0\n lands on the northerly bank. And so of the grantees and licensees of the state.\n The riparian claims pressed on our attention all relate to the river bed between the 98th degree of west longitude and the mouth of the North fork. \n16\n They must be considered in the light of matters which we proceed to state.\n By a treaty between the United States and the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes of Indians, concluded in 1867, the territory north of the 'middle of the main channel' of the Red river and between the Ninety- Eighth meridian and the North fork was set apart as a reservation and permanent home for those tribes. 15 Stat. 581, 589. That reservation was maintained until June 6, 1900, when Congress passed an act (chapter 813,  6, 31 Stat. 672, 676), directing that it be disposed of (a) by allotting in severalty to each member of the tribes 160 acres, (b) by setting apart 480,000 acres of grazing lands for the common use of the tribes, (c) by reserving four sections in each township for the future state of Oklahoma for school and other public purposes, and (d) by subjecting the remaining lands to particular modes of entry and acquisition under designated land laws. Besides the allotments and grazing reserves, the Indians were to receive stated payments in money. The Indians assailed the validity of the act, but in Lone Wolf v. Hitchock, \n187 U.S. 553\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 216, this court sustained it as a legitimate exertion of the power of Congress over tribal Indians and their property, and the act was carried into effect. Like the treaty reservation, the provisions of the act were in terms limited to the territory north of the 'middle of the main channel' of the river.\n One of the grazing reserves created under that act contained 400,000 acres, and the order setting it apart made the 'midchannel' of the river its southern boundary. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 593]\n\u00a0\n That reserve came to be known as the Big Pasture and was maintained until June 5, 1906, when Congress passed an act (chapter 2580, 34 Stat. 213) requiring that it be disposed of (a) by alloting in severalty to each child born into the tribes after the act of 1900, 160 acres, and (b) by subjecting the remaining lands to particular modes of entry and sale and placing the proceeds in the Treasury to the credit of the tribes. Subsequent amendments made some changes, not material here, in the modes of entry and sale, and directed the use of a part of the proceeds in maintaining a hospital which was open to and used by the members of the tribes. The last amendment was made June 30, 1913, c. 4,  17, 38 Stat. 77, 92.\n The lands on the northerly bank of the river between the 98th meridian and the North fork were all disposed of under the act of 1900, or that of 1906 and its amendments-some as Indian allotments, some through entries or purchases in the designated modes, and some under the grant to Oklahoma for school and other public purposes. The riparian claims are all founded on these disposals. The river bed there is from 1,500 to 6,600 feet wide between what are called the cut-banks.\n The receivership area lies immediately south of what was the Big Pasture and has the same easterly and westerly limits.\n One of the questions involved in the riparian claims relates to what was intended by the terms 'middle of the main channel' and 'mid-channel' as used in defining the southerly boundary of the treaty reservation and of the Big Pasture. When applied to navigable streams such terms usually refer to the thread of the navigable current, and, if there be several, to the thread of the one best suited and ordinarily used for navigation. \n17\n But this \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 594]\n\u00a0\n section of Red river obviously is not navigable. It is without a continuous or dependable flow, has a relatively level bed of loose sand over which the water is well distributed when there is a substantial volume, and has no channel of any permanence other than that of which this sand bed is the bottom. The mere ribbons of shallow water which in relatively dry seasons find their way over the sand bed, readily and frequently shifting from one side to the other, cannot be regarded as channels in the sense intended. Evidently something less transient and better suited to mark a boundary was in mind. We think it was the channel extending from one cutbank to the other, which carries the water in times of a substantial flow. That was the only real channel and therefore the main channel. So its medial line must be what was designated as the Indian boundary.\n Other questions common to all the riparian claims are, whether the disposal of the lands on the northerly bank carried with it any right to the river bed in front of them, and, if so, whether this rights extends to the medial line of the stream or to the Texas boundary along the opposite bank. On these questions the parties are far apart. The state of Oklahoma and the placer mining claimants insist that no right to the river bed passed with the upland; the United States that such a right did pass, but extends only to the medial line, and the several riparian claimants that the right passed and extends to the Texas boundary along the opposite bank.\n Where the United States owns the bed of a nonnavigable stream and the upland on one or both sides, it, of course, is free when disposing of the upland to retain all or any part of the river bed; and whether in any particular instance it has done so is essentially a question of what it intended. If by a treaty or statute or the terms of its patent it has shown that it intended to restrict the conveyance to the upland or to that and a part only of the \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 595]\n\u00a0\n river bed, that intention will be controlling;18 and, if its intention be not otherwise shown, it will be taken to have assented that its conveyance should be construed and given effect in this particular according to the law of the state in which the land lies. \n19\n Where it is disposing of tribal land of Indians under its guardianship the same rules apply.\n What has been said concerning the treaty reservation, the Big Pasture and the acts of 1900 and 1906 shows that the United States intended to dispose of the upland and the northerly half of the river bed, but nothing more. The southerly half of the bed had not been included in the reservation or the Big Pasture, and was not subjected to the operation of the act of 1900 or that of 1906. This shows that the United States intended to retain that part of the bed. It follows that, while the disposals under those acts could extend southward to the medial line, they could not go beyond it.\n In executing the acts there was no attempt to dispose of the river bed separately from the upland. The disposals were all according to the legal subdivisions established by the survey of the upland and shown on the official plat. In the patents there was no express inclusion or exclusion of rights in the river bed.\n Tested by the common law these conveyances of riparian tracts conferred a title extending not merely to the water line, but to the middle of the stream. Possibly, if the river bed for its entire breadth had been subject to \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 596]\n\u00a0\n disposal under the Acts of 1900 and 1906, the title would have extended to the Texas boundary along the other side; but this is a debatable question which need not be considered here, for no disposal under those acts could go beyond the medial line. That limitation inhered in all that was done.\n But it is contended that the commonlaw rule, although formerly adopted in Oklahoma20 and recently recognized by the Supreme Court of the state,21 has been impliedly abrogated by the Legislature. The contention is not sustained by any decision in the state and, in our opinion, is not tenable. It is based on statutes displacing or qualifying the common-law rule respecting the rights of riparian proprietors in the natural flow of the stream, which is a matter quite distinct from the ownership of the bed of the stream. The rule as to either could be displaced without affecting the other.\n Out conclusion on the general questions is that the disposal of the lands on the northerly bank carried with it a right to the bed of the river as far as, but not beyond, the medial line.\n Particular questions relating to some of the riparian claims and not to others are presented, and we now turn to them.\n The Indian allotments were made in 1909 and 1910, but have not been carried to final patents. They are evidenced by trust patents, so-called, wherein the United States engages to hold the land for a period of 25 years 'in trust for sole use and benefit' of the allottee, or of his heirs in the event of his death, and at the end of the trust period to convey the same to him, or to his heirs if he be not then living. The contention is made that no right to the river bed could pass under these \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 597]\n\u00a0\n allotments in advance of the issue of the final patent. Even if this were so, it well may be doubted that it would enable strangers to fasten any claim on or appropriate the bed in front of the allotments. But we think it is not so. The allotments when perfected passed the equitable title and beneficial use to all that would have passed under a full patent. The purpose of the holding in trust by the United States is to prevent allottees from improvidently alienating or incumbering the land, not to cut down or postpone their rights in other respects.\n The lands along the north bank were surveyed and platted in 1874 and 1875. Afterwards, and before the disposals in question, portions of the bank were swept away in times of flood. This changed the relation to the river of several surveyed tracts. Some became part of the bed and others nonriparian before became riparian. But most of the tracts on which the riparian claims before us are founded remained unchanged an need not be specially noticed.\n Of the tracts changed from riparian upland to river bed, a small number were disposed of as if they still were upland abutting on the river- the disposal occurring while the adjacent land then actually riparian was unallotted and unsold. Evidently the disposal was intended to operate and have effect as if the tracts retained their former relation to the river; and, as nothing stood in the way, we think the title under the disposal reached to the middle of the stream.\n Of the tracts which had been nonriparian but became riparian, all were disposed of in ordinary course. Generally the tracts in front of them which came to lie in the river bed were neither allotted nor sold. Where this was so, we think the right to the bed, out to be center line, passed with the tracts which had come to be riparian. But where there was a prior disposal of the tracts in the bed, that right, as just indicated, went with them. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 598]\n\u00a0\n Four legal subdivisions in township 5, south of range 14, west, were sold to Fred Capshaw and transferred by him to A. E. Pearson et al., who are interveners here. Two of these subdivisions, lots 1 and 2 of section 8, were riparian when surveyed, but in the river bed when sold. Another, the N. W. 1\/4 of the N. W. 1\/4 of the same section, lay immediately back of these lots. The fourth, the N. E. 1\/4 of the N. E. 1\/4 of section 7, lay to one side of the third. At the time of the survey the fourth was separated from the river by a tract which afterwards came to be largely, if not entirely, in the river bed. This tract was sold to Robert L. Owen before the others were sold to Capshawn. Pearson et al. claim the river bed in front of lots 1 and 2 of section 8 and also in front of the N. E. 1\/4 of the N. E. 1\/4 of section 7. Their rights are just what Capshaw's were, neither more nor less. We think the bed of the river in front of the two lots in section 8, out to the middle, passed to Capshaw, but that nor part of the bed passed to him with the N. E. 1\/4 of the N. E. 1\/4 of section 7. All that could passibly have passed with that subdivision had already passed to Owen with the tract which lay in front of it.\n The state of Oklahoma in its bill claimed riparian rights in portions of the bed by reason of its ownership of occasional school and other lands on the bank; but in its brief it has endeavored only to sustain the claim based on the asserted navigability of the river. As to the latter it has failed. According to the evidence, it owns riparian lands both within and without what was the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache reservation. As to such lands it is entitled to the same incidents of riparian ownership that any other owner would have. The fact that it has not pressed this right in its brief might be regarded by some as a waiver or renunciation of the right; but this hardly can have been intended. The state's riparian right will therefore be recognized in the decree. \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 599]\n\u00a0\n What has been said indicates the disposition which must be made of all the riparian claims. It would serve no purpose to enumerate them here. All will be dealt with in the decree conformably to the views we have expressed.\n We come next to the claims founded on placer mining locations. These locations were all made in that part of the southerly half of the river bed which is in front of what was the Big Pasture. It is objected that some are overlapped by others, and that some were without a supporting mineral discovery. But we put these questions aside and come directly to one which is common to all the locations, namely, whether that part of the bed was subject to location and acquisition under the mining laws. The placer claimants insist that it was, and the United States that it was not. No one doubts that when these locations were made lands valuable for oil, if within areas where the mining laws were operative, could be located and acquired as placer claims.\n The claimants rely on section 2319 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St .  4614), which declares:\n'All valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the United States and those who have declared their intention to become such, under regulations prescribed by law, and according to the local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts, so far as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the laws of the United States.'\n\n This section is not as comprehensive as its words separately considered suggest. It is part of a chapter relating to mineral lands which in turn is part of a title dealing with the survey and disposal of 'The Public Lands.' To be rightly understood it must be read with due regard \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 600]\n\u00a0\n for the entire statute of which it is but a part, and when this is done it is apparent that, while embracing only lands owned by the United States, it does not embrace all that are so owned. Of course, it has no application to the grounds about the Capitol in Washington or to the lands in the National Cemetery at Arlington, no matter what their mineral value; and yet both belong to the United States. And so of the lands in the Yosemite National Park, the Yellowstone National Park, and the military reservations throughout the Western States. Only where the United States has indicated that the lands are held for disposal under the land laws does the section apply; and it never applies where the United States directs that the disposal be only under other laws.\n This part of the river bed was for many years in the Indian Territory, to which none of the land laws ever was extended. In 1890 it was made part of the territory of Oklahoma by an act wherein Congress expressly indicated that the lands in that territory should be disposed of under the homestead and town-site laws 'only.' \n22\n\u00a0\n\n A question arose under that act as to whether the exclusion of the mining laws relieved homestead applicants from offering proof that the land sought to be entered was agricultural and not mineral, such proof being required where the mining laws were in force; and Congress promptly answered that question by saying, in an act of 1891, that 'all lands in Oklahoma are hereby declared to be agricultural lands, and proof of their nonmineral character shall not be required as a condition precedent to final entry.' \n23\n In the many acts which followed wherein lands in Oklahoma were opened to disposal all but two exactly conformed to the policy announced in \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 601]\n\u00a0\n the acts of 1890 and 1891. The two exceptional acts were one of 1895 dealing with the Wichita lands24 and the one of 1900, before described, dealing with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache lands. \n25\n The act of 1895 expressly extended the mining laws over the limited area to which it related, which was remote from the one with which we are here concerned. The act of 1900 expressly extended the mining laws to a part, but not all, of the lands to which it related-that is to say, it extended them to such lands as were to be allotted and opened to settlement, but not to those set apart as grazing reserves. There never was any act subjecting the latter to the operation of the mining laws. On the contrary, the act of 1906 and its amendments show that the Big Pasture and other grazing reserves were to be disposed of only in other modes specially defined.\n Thus the general policy in respect of lands in Oklahoma has been that the mining laws should not apply to them, and to this there have been but two exceptions, each confined to a limited area and neither embracing the locality in question. Even the words of the exceptions, 'are hereby extended over' the particular areas, plainly imply that but for them the mining laws would not have applied to those areas. The general policy is also reflected in the act of 1906, providing for Oklahoma's admission into the Union, the eighth section of which distinctly recognized the right of the state to receive mineral lands under the grants to it for school and other purposes26-a thing not permitted to a state where the mining laws are in force. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n This is the view which has been uniformly taken and enforced by the officers of the Land Department in the \n\n[258 U.S. 574, 602]\n\u00a0\n administration of these acts. \n28\n Those officers have not recognized or given any effect to these mining claims.\n We conclude that this part of the river bed never was subject to location or acquisition under the mining laws-nor, indeed, to acquisition under any of the land laws-and therefore that these locations were of no effect and conferred no rights on the locators or their assigns.\n The parties in interest will be accorded 20 days within which to submit a proper form of decree disposing of the several claims now before us in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See United States v.

EASTERN TEXAS R CO(1922)\nNo. 298\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 204, 205]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Tom L. Beauchamp and C. M. Cureton, both of Austin, Tex., for appellants.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. B. Perkins, of Dallas, Tex., for appellee railroad companies.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 204, 212]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter McFarland, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By section 402 of the Transportation Act of 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 477, several new paragraphs were added to section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (24 Stat. 379) as theretofore amended. Paragraphs 18, 19, and 20 are copied in the margin. \n1\n By \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 213]\n\u00a0\n them Congress has undertaken to regulate the construction and acquisition of new or additional lines of railroad and the extension and abandonment of old lines, and to invest the Interstate Commerce Commission with important administrative powers in that connection. Like the act of which they are amendatory, these paragraphs are expressly restricted to carriers engaged in transporting persons or property in interstate and foreign commerce. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Our present concern is with the provisions relating to the abandonment of existing lines. They declare that \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 214]\n\u00a0\n 'no carrier by railroad subject to this act shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit of such abandonment' (paragraph 18); that when application for such a certificate is received the Cimmission shall cause notice thereof to be given to the Governor of the state wherein the line lies and published in newspapers of general circulation in each county along the line, and shall accord a hearing to the state and all parties in interest (paragraph 19); that the Commission may grant or refuse the certificate in whole or in part and impose such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity require; and that when the certificate is issued, and not before, the carrier may, 'without securing approval other than such certificate,' comply with the terms and conditions imposed and proceed with the abandonment covered by the certificate (paragraph 20).\n The Eastern Texas Railroad Company, a Texas corporation, owns and operates in that state a line of railroad 30.3 miles in length. Approximately three-fourths of the traffic over the road is in interstate and foreign commerce and the rest is in intrastate commerce. The company neither owns nor operates any other line. The road was constructed in 1902 to serve extensive lumber industries, but in subsequent years the adjacent timber was removed and the mills dismantled. The company claims that since 1917 the road has been operated at a loss.\n On June 3, 1920, the company filed with the Commission an application for a certificate authorizing it to abandon and cease operating its road, full notice of the application being regularly given. The state declined to appear before the Commission, but others, who were being served by the road, appeared and opposed the application. A full hearing was had and, on December 2, 1920 the \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 215]\n\u00a0\n Commission made and filed a report concluding as follows:\n'Upon consideration of the record we find that the present public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment of the applicant's line, and we further find that permission to abandon the line should be made subject to the right of interested persons in the community served to purchase the property at a figure not in excess of $50,000. A certificate and order to that effect will be issued.'\n\n The certificate and order were issued and the railroad company indicated its assent to the condition imposed, but, so far as appears, no one sought to purchase under the condition.\n While the application was pending before the Cimmission and before the certificate was issued, the state brought a suit in one of its courts against the railroad company and some of its officers to enjoin them from ceasing to operate the road in intrastate commerce. The bill was brought on the theory that under the laws of the state the company was obliged to continue the operation of the road in intrastate commerce; that the provisions of the Transportation Act were unconstitutional and void, if and in so far as they authorize the abandonment of such a road as respects intrastate commerce, and that the company in asking the Commission to sanction such an abandonment was proceeding in disregard of its obligations to the state. At the instance of the defendants the suit was removed to the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas. During the pendency of the suit the Commission issued the certificate and the defendants then sought the benefit of it by a supplemental answer. The court held that the certificate constituted a compete defense, and without a hearing on other issues dismissed the suit. The state appealed directly to this court. That appeal is No. 298.\n After the Commission granted the certificate the state brought a suit in the District Court of the United States \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 216]\n\u00a0\n for the Eastern District of Texas against the United States, the railroad company and others to set aside and annul the Cimmission's order and certificate on the grounds, first, that the provisions of the Transportation Act, rightly interpreted, did not afford any basis for granting a certificate sanctioning the abandonment of the company's road as respects intrastate commerce, and, secondly, if those provisions purported to authorize such a certificate, they were to that extent in excess of the power of Congress and an encroachment on the reserved powers of the state. The defendants moved to dismiss the bill as ill founded in point of merits, and the court sustained the motions and entered a decree of dismissal. The state appealed directly to this court. That appeal is No. 563.\n Counsel attribute to these cases a breadth which they do not have; and for obvious reasons we shall deal with them as they are, not as they might be.\n Up to the time Commission made the order granting the certificate a part of the commerce passing over the road was interstate and foreign, that is, was bound to or from other states and foreign countries. It is not questioned that Congress could, nor that it did, authorize the Commission to sanction a discontinuance of this interstate and foreign business. Neither is it questioned that the Commission's certificate was adequate for that purpose. The only matters in controversy are whether, by paragraphs 18, 19 and 20, Congress has assumed to clothe the Commission with authority to sanction the entire abandonment of a road such as this, and, if so, whether the power of Congress extends so far.\n The road lies entirely within a single state, is owned and operated by a corporation of that state, and is not a part of another line. Its continued operation solely in intrastate commerce cannot be of more than local concern. Interstate and foreign commerce will not be burdened or affected by any shortage in the earnings nor will \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 217]\n\u00a0\n any carrier in such commerce have to bear or make good the shortage. It is not as if the road were a branch or extension whose unremunerative operation would or might burden or cripple the main line and thereby affect its utility or service as an artery of interstate and foreign commerce.\n If paragraphs 18, 19, and 20 be construed as authorizing the Commission to deal with the abandonment of such a road as to intrastate as well as interstate and foreign commerce, a serious question of their constitutional validity will be unavoidable. If they be given a more restricted construction, their validity will be undoubted. Of such a situation this court has said, 'where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.' United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 U.S. 366\n, 407-408, 29 Sup. Ct. 527.\n Although found in the Transportation Act, these paragraphs are amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act and are so styled. They contain some broad language, but do not plainly or certainly show that they are intended to provide for the complete abandonment of a road like the one we have described. Only by putting a liberal interpretation on general terms can they be said to go so far. Being amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act they are to be read in connection with it and with other amendments of it. As a whole these acts show that what is intended is to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and to affect intrastate commerce only as that may be incidental to the effective regulation and protection of commerce of the other class. They contain many manifestations of a continuing purpose to refrain from any regulation of intrastate commerce, save such as is involved in the rightful exertion of the power of Congress over interstate and foreign commerce. Minnesota Rate Case, 230 \n\n[258 U.S. 204, 218]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 352, 418, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232. And had there been a purpose here to depart from the accustomed path and to deal with intrastate commerce as such independently of any effect on interstate and foreign commerce, it is but reasonable to believe that that purpose would have been very plainly declared. This was not done.\n These considerations persuade us that the paragraphs in question should be interpreted and read as not clothing the Commission with any authority over the discontinuance of the purely intrastate business of a road whose situation and ownership, as here, are such that interstate and foreign commerce will not be burdened or affected by a continuance of that business.\n Whether, apart from the Commission's certificate, the railroad company is entitled to abandon its intrastate business is not before us, so we have no occasion for considering to what extent the decisions in Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183, and Bullock v. Railroad Commission of Florida, \n254 U.S. 513\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 193, may be applicable to this road.\n As the District Courts both accorded to the Cimmission's certificate a wider operation and effect than can be given to it consistently with the provisions of paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 as we interpret them, the decrees must be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Decrees reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] (18) After ninety days after this paragraph takes effect no carrier by railroad subject to this act shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, or shall acquire or operate any line of railroad, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transportation under this act over or by means of such additional or extended line of railroad, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line of railroad, and no carrier by railroad subject to this act shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit of such abandonment.\n (19) The application for and issuance of any such certificate shall be under such rules and regulations as to hearings and other matters as the Commission may from time to time prescribe, and the provisions of this act shall apply to all such proceedings. Upon receipt of any application for such certificate the Cimmission shall cause notice thereof to be given to and a copy filed with the governor of each state in which such additional or extended line of railroad is proposed to be constructed or operated, or all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, is proposed to be abandoned, with the right to be heard as hereinafter provided with respect to the hearing of complaints or the issuance of securities; and said notice shall also be published for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation in each county in or through which said line of railroad is constructed or operates.\n (20) The Cimmission shall have power to issue such certificate as prayed for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion or portions of a line of railroad, or extension thereof, described in the application, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the issuance of the cetificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. From and after issuance of such certificate, and not before, the carrier by railroad may, without securing approval other than such certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the construction, operation, or abandonment covered thereby. Any construction, operation, or abandonment contrary to the provisions of this paragraph or of paragraph ( 18) or (19) of this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the Commission, any commission or regulating body of the state or states affected, or any party in interest; and any carrier which, or any director, officer, receiver, operating trustee, lessee, agent, or person, acting for or employed by such carrier, who knowingly authorizes, consents to, or permits any violation of the provisions of this paragraph or of paragraph ( 18) of this section, shall upon conviction thereof be punished by a find of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than three years, or both. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See amended paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Act to Regulate Commerce as set forth in section 400 of the Transportation Act of 1920. \n\n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF TEXAS v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1922)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Tom. L. Beauchamp and C. M. Cureton, both of Austin, Tex., for complainant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for Railroad Labor Board.\n Mr. Patrick J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Alfred P. Thom, of Washington, D. C., for Association of Railway Executives, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought in this court by the state of Texas against the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Railroad Labor Board. The relief sought is, first, a declaration that the main provisions1 of titles III and IV of the Transportation Act of 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 469, 474, are unconstitutional and void; \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n secondly, an annulment of all action heretofore taken thereunder, by either defendant, in respect of railroad carriers in Texas; and thirdly, an injunction restraining the defendants from taking any further action thereunder in respect of those carriers. The right of the state to bring the suit, our power to entertain it, and the merits of the case made by the bill are all challenged by motions to dismiss.\n In the bill and supporting brief the defendants are spoken of as citizens of states other than Texas, and this is treated as bringing the suit within our original jurisdiction. But both defendants are sued as corporate entities created by the United States for governmental purposes; and, if that be their status,2 they are not citizens of any state,3 but have the same relation to one state as to another. So, to entertain the suit, we should have to find some ground of jurisdiction other than the one suggested. But we need not stop to consider the possible grounds whereon a state may invoke our original jurisdiction, because an examination of the bill discloses insuperable obstacles to our entertaining it on any ground.\n The provisions of titles III and IV which are drawn in question are all in terms confined to matters pertaining to railroad carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and evidently were enacted in what Congress regarded as an exercise of its power to regulate such commerce.\n Those relating to the Railroad Labor Board-they are in title III-may be summarized as clothing the Board with authority to entertain and decide disputes between carriers and their employes in respect of wages, grievances, rules or working conditions; as directing that all parties to such a dispute be accorded a hearing either in \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n person or by counsel; and as requiring that the decisions be entered in an appropriate record and that they and all violations of them be given such publicity as the Board may indicate.\n The provisions relating to the Interstate Commerce Commission-these are in title IV-may be summarized as investing the Commission with a substantial measure of control or supervision over interstate rates and fares; over the removal of any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference or prejudice, as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and in interstate commerce on the other, arising from intrastate rates and fares; over the removal of any undue, unreasonable or unjust discrimination against interstate commerce caused by intrastate rates and fares; over the division of the carriers of the country into territorial groups for valuation and rate making purposes; over what shall be regarded as a fair return on the aggregate value of the property of the carriers in each group; over the maintenance and use of certain reserve and contingent funds to be set apart from any revenues in excess of such fair return; over the construction and acquisition of new lines and the extension and abandonment of old ones; over the pooling of traffic or earnings; over the consolidation of carriers; over the issue of stocks, bonds and other securities by carriers, and over making the same person a director or officer of more than one carrier. These provisions contemplate and require in respect of most of the matters recited that the state wherein the carrier's line lies shall be notified and accorded a hearing before a finding or order is made by the Commission.\n Other statutes prescribe that orders of the Commission, other than for the payment of money as reparation, may be enforced in the District Courts at the suit of the United States, or may be annulled, set aside or suspended in the District Court at the suit of any aggrieved party \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n in interest, but that all suits of the latter class shall be brought against the United States as the principal defendant.\n The bill is of unusual length, 65 printed pages. Much of it is devoted to the presentation of an abstract question of legislative power- whether the matters dealt with in several of the provisions of titles III and IV fall within the fleld wherein Congress may speak with constitutional authority, or within the field reserved to the several states. The claim of the state, elaborately set forth, is that they fall within the latter field, and therefore that the congressional enactment is void. Obviously, this part of the bill does not present a case or controversy within the range of the judicial power as defined by the Constitution. It is only where rights, in themselves appropriate subjects of judicial cognizance, are being, or about to be, affected prejudicially by the application or enforcement of a statute that its validity may be called in question by a suitor and determined by an exertion of the judicial power. Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 73, et seq.; Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 361\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 250; Stearns v. Wood, \n236 \nU.S. 75, 78\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 229.\n The portion of the bill particularly directed against the action of the Railroad Labor Board alleges, in effect, that the Board, proceeding under title III, has heard and decided divers disputes over working conditions and wages between carriers in Texas and their employes; that conformably to these decisions the working conditions have been changed and the wages of the employes materially raised; and that as a result the operating expense of the carriers has been greatly increased, necessity for a larger operating income has arisen, rates and fares have been raised accordingly, and producers, shippers, and consumers have been and are being injuriously affected.\n Even if these allegations, in connection with other parts of the bill, could be regarded as presenting a concrete \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n controversy turning on the validity of title III, this would not enable us to entertain the suit. The bill makes it plain that the carriers and employes have put the Board's decisions into effect and have adjusted their relations on that basis. There are none to whom the controversy would be of such immediate concern as to them; and should it be resolved against the validity of title III and the Board's action annulled their interests would be directly and unavoidably affected. They are not parties to the bill; nor do any of those who are parties represent them. The Board does not claim to do so, and the attitude of the state is antagonistic to them. To take up and solve the controversy without their presence and without their being represented would be quite inadmissible, considering the exceptional nature of our original jurisdiction. California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n157 \nU.S. 229, 257\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 591; Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 \nU.S. 199, 245\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 308. If their citizenship be such that they cannot be brought into the suit consistently with the limitations on our original jurisdiction, this does not justify us in proceeding in their absence. The cases just cited leave no doubt on this point.\n The portion of the bill particularly directed against the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission charges, in substance, that the Commission, proceeding under title IV, has placed the carriers of Texas in a territorial rate group with carriers of other states where railroad construction and operation are attended with greater cost, has approved a general increase in the interstate rates and fares of carriers in that group, has directed a corresponding increase in the intrastate rates and fares of carriers in Texas, has authorized the abandonment by certain carriers of their lines within the state, and has exercised a supervision over the issue of stocks, bonds and other securities by carriers chartered by the state-all of which orders, it is alleged, impinge on the powers \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n reserved to the state and subject its citizens to unnecessary expense and great inconvenience.\n If the state have a right to sue to annul these orders, a familiar rule requires that it shall proceed with due regard for the rights of the carriers who have put the orders into effect and are conforming to them. On the question whether the orders are invalid and should be annulled, or are valid and should be upheld, the carriers are entitled to be heard. Their interests are directly involved and will be necessarily affected by the outcome. They are not parties to the bill, and as to all but one the bill makes it clear that their citizenship is an obstacle to making them such. This, without more, would preclude us from awarding any relief on this portion of the bill. California v. Southern Pacific Co., supra; Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., supra. Besides, there are statutory provisions, before noticed, which direct that all suits to set aside, annul or suspend orders of the Commission be brought in the District Courts and the United States made a defnedant. Judicial Code,  207, 208, 211 (Comp. St.  993, 997, 1004); Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 219- 220 (Comp. St.  992, 994, 995, 998, 1000). These provisions were recently considered by us in a related case and it was there held that the public policy which they refiect requires that a state aggrieved by such an order be remitted to the remedy which they afford-a suit in the District Court in which the United States is made a party. North Dakota v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n257 U.S. 485\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 170 (decided January 23, 1922).\n Some emphasis is laid on two state ments in the bill-one that the state owns an intrastate railroad 33.55 miles in length and operates the same as a common carrier, and the other that it is a shipper of freight and user of passenger transportation over other lines in both interstate and intrastate commerce. Apparently the only purpose of these statements is to show that the state has such an interest as entitles it to call in question the orders of the Commission dealing with rates and fares. At all events, \n\n[258 U.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n the bill does not connect them with any of the other questions sought to be presented or predicate any other claim to relief on them. They therefore are covered by the ruling that suits to set aside, annul or suspend the Commission's Orders should be brought in the District Courts where all proper parties, including the United States, may be made defendants and accorded an appropriate hearing.\n What has been said suffices to show that we are not at liberty to entertain the bill in the exercise of our limited original jurisdiction.\n In passing it should be observed that some of the provisions of the Transportation Act, assailed by the bill, have recently been upheld in other cases brought before us in regular course on appeal from decrees in the District Courts.

The bill was brought in 1911, the evidence was \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 456]\n\u00a0\n taken in 1913 and 1914, and the parties put it in condensed and narrative form in 1916 preparatory to the usual printing. The case has been argued at the bar three times. The court directed one reargument because of the novelty and importance of some of the questions involved, and the other because of an intervening succession in the office of Chief Justice. As the United States appeared to have a possible interest in some of the questions, the court also directed that the suit be called to the attention of the Attorney General, and, by the court's leave, a representative of the United States participated in the subsequent hearings.\n The Laramie is an unnavigable river which has its source in the mountains of Northern Colorado, flows northerly 27 miles in that state, crosses into Wyoming, and there flows northerly and northeasterly 150 miles to the North Platte river, of which it is a tributary. Both Colorado and Wyoming are in the arid region, where flowing waters are, and long have been, commonly diverted from their natural channels and used in irrigating the soil and making it productive. For many years some of the waters of the Laramie river have been subjected to such diversion and use, part in Colorado and part in Wyoming.\n When this suit was brought, the two corporate defendants, acting under the authority and permission of Colorado, were proceeding to divert in that state a considerable portion of the waters of the river and to conduct the same into another watershed, lying wholly in Colorado, for use in irrigating lands more than 50 miles distant from the point of diversion. The topography and natural drainage are such that none of the water can return to the stream or ever reach Wyoming.\n By the bill Wyoming seeks to prevent this diversion on two grounds: One that, without her sanction, the waters of this interstate stream cannot rightfully be taken from \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 457]\n\u00a0\n its watershed and carried into another, where she never can receive any benefit from them; and the other that through many appropriations made at great cost, which are prior in time and superior in right to the proposed Colorado diversion, Wyoming and her citizens have become and are entitled to use a large portion of the waters of the river in the irrigation of lands in that state and that the proposed Colorado diversion will not leave in the stream sufficient water to satisfy these prior and superior appropriations, and so will work irreparable prejudice to Wyoming and her citizens.\n By the answers Colorado and her codefendants seeks to justify and sustain the proposed diversion on three distinct grounds: First, that it is the right of Colorado as a state to dispose, as she may choose, of any part or all of the waters flowing in the portion of the river within her borders, 'regardless of the prejudice that it may work' to Wyoming and her citizens; secondly, that Colorado is entitled to an equitable division of the waters of the river, and that the proposed diversion, together with all subsisting appropriations in Colorado, does not exceed her share; and, thirdly, that after the proposed diversion there will be left in the river and its tributaries in Wyoming sufficient water to satisfy all appropriations in that state whose origin was prior in time to the effective inception of the right under which the proposed Colorado diversion is about to be made.\n Before taking up the opposing contentions a survey of several matters in the light of which they should be approached and considered is in order.\n Both Colorado and Wyoming are along the apex of the Continental Divide, and include high mountain ranges where heavy snows fall in winter and melt in late spring and early summer; this being the chief source of water supply. Small streams in the mountains gather the water from the melting snow and conduct it to larger streams \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 458]\n\u00a0\n below, which ultimately pass into surrounding states. The flow in all streams varies greatly in the course of the year, being highest in May, June, and July, and relatively very low in other months. There is also a pronounced variation from year to year. To illustrate, the gaging of the Cache la Poudre, a typical stream, for 1912 shows that the total flow for May, June, and July was more than three times that for the nine other months, and the gaging for a period of thirty years shows that the yearly flow varied from 151,636 to 666,466 acre-feet1 and was in excess of 400, 000 acre-feet in each of four years and less than 175,000 acre-feet in each of five years. Both states have vast plains and many valleys of varying elevation, where there is not sufficient natural precipitation to moisten the soil and make it productive, but where, when additional water is applied artificially, the soil becomes fruitful-the reward being generous in some areas and moderate in others, just as husbandry is variously rewarded in states where there is greater humidity, such as Massachusetts, Virginia, Ohio, and Tennessee. Both states were territories long before they were admitted into the Union as states and while the territorial condition continued were under the full dominion of the United States. At first the United States owned all the lands in both, and it still owns and is offering for disposal millions of acres in each.\n Turning to the decisions of the courts of last resort in the two states, we learn that the same doctrine respecting the diversion and use of the waters of natural streams has prevailed in both from the beginning, and that each state attributes much of her development and prosperity to the practiclal operation of this doctrine. The relevant views of the origin and nature of the doctrine, as shown in these decisions, may be summarized as follows: The \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 459]\n\u00a0\n common-law rule respecting riparian rights in flowing water never obtained in either state. It always was deemed inapplicable to their situation and climatic conditions. The earliest settlers gave effect to a different rule whereby the waters of the streams were regarded as open to appropriation for irrigation, mining, and other beneficial purposes. The diversion from the stream and the application of the water to a beneficial purpose constituted an appropriation, and the appropriator was treated as acquiring a continuing right to divert and use the water to the extent of his appropriation, but not beyond what was reasonably required and actually used. This was deemed a property right and dealt with and respected accordingly. As between different appropriations from the same stream, the one first in time was deemed superior in right, and a completed appropriation was regarded as effective from the time the purpose to make it was definitely formed and actual work thereon was begun, provided the work was carried to completion with reasonable diligence. This doctrine of appropriation, prompted by necessity and formulated by custom, received early legislative recognition in both territories and was enforced in their courts. When the states were admitted into the Union it received further sanction in their Constitutions and statutes and their courts have been uniformly enforcing it. Yunker v.

St. Rep. 986.\n As the United States possessed plenary authority over Colorado and Wyoming while they were territories and \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 460]\n\u00a0\n has at all times owned the public lands therein, we turn next to its action.\n The Act of July 26, 1866, c. 262,  9, 14 Stat. 251 (Comp. St.  4647 ), contained a section providing:\n'Whenever, by priority of possession, rights to the use of water for mining, agricultural, manufacturing, or other purposes, have vested and accrued, and the same are recognized and acknowledged by the local customs, laws, and the decisions of courts, the possessors and owners of such vested rights shall be maintained and protected in the same.'\n\n The occasion for this provision and its purpose and effect were extensively considered by this court in the cases of Atchison v. Peterson, 20 Wall. 507, and Basey v. Gallagher, 20 Wall. 670, 681, 682, the conclusions in both being shown in the following excerpt from the latter.\n'In the late case of Atchison v. Peterson, we had occasion to consider the respective rights of miners to running waters on the mineral lands of the public domain; and we there held that by the custom which had obtained among miners in the Pacific states and territories, the party who first subjected the water to use, or took the necessary steps for that purpose, was regarded, except as against the government, as the source of title in all controveries respecting it; that the doctrines of the common law declaratory of the rights of riparian proprietors were inapplicable, or applicable, only to a limited extent, to the necessities of miners, and were inadequate to their protection; that the equality of right recognized by that law among all the proprietors upon the same stream, would have been incompatible with any extended diversion of the water by one proprietor, and its conveyance for mining purposes to points from which it could not be restored to the stream; that the government by its silent acquiescence had assented to and encouraged the occupation of the public lands for mining; and that he who first connected his labor with property thus situated \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 461]\n\u00a0\n and open to general exploration, did in natural justice acquire a better right to its use and enjoyment than others who had not given such labor; that the miners on the public lands throughout the Pacific states and territories, by their customs, usages, and regulations, had recognized the inherent justice of this principle, and the principle itself was at an early period recognized by legislation and enforced by the courts in those states and territories, and was finally approved by the legislation of Congress in 1866. The views there expressed and the rulings made are equally applicable to the use of water on the public lands for purposes of irrigation. No distinction is made in those states and territories by the custom of miners or settlers, or by the courts, in the rights of the first appropriator from the use made of the water, if the use be a beneficial one.'\n\n And on the same subject it was further said, in Broder v. Water Co., \n101 U.S. 274\n, 276:\n'It is the established doctrine of this court that rights of miners who had taken possession of mines and worked and developed them, and the rights of persons who had constructed canals and ditches to be used in mining operations and for purposes of agricultural irrigation, in the region where such artificial use of the water was an obsolute necessity, are rights which the government had, by its conduct, recognized and encouraged and was bound to protect, before the passage of the act of 1866. We are of opinion that the section of the act which we have quoted was rather a voluntary recognition of a pre- existing right of possession, constituting a valid claim to its continued use, than the establishment of a new one.'\n\n The Act of July 9, 1870, c. 235,  17, 16 Stat. 217 (Comp. St.  4648 ), provided that 'all patents granted, or preemption or homesteads allowed, shall be subject to any vested and accrued water rights' acquired under or recognized by the provision of 1866. These provisions are now sections 2339 and 2340 of the Revised Statutes. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 462]\n\u00a0\n The Act of March 3, 1877, c. 107,  1, 19 Stat. 377 (Comp. St.  4674 ), providing for the sale of desert lands in tracts of one section each to persons undertaking and effecting their reclamation, contained a proviso declaring that--\n'The right to the use of water by the person so conducting the same, on or to any tract of desert land of six hundred and forty acres shall depend upon bona fide prior appropriation; and such right shall not exceed the amount of water actually appropriated, and necessarily used for the purpose of irrigation and reclamation; and all surplus water over and above such actual appropriation and use, together with the water of all lakes, rivers and other sources of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable, shall remain and be held free for the appropriation and use of the public for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes subject to existing rights.'\n\n Colorado was not at first included in this act, but was brought in by an amendatory act. Next came the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,  18, 26 Stat. 1095 (Comp. St.  4934), granting rights of way through the public lands and reservations for canals and ditches to be used for irrigation purposes, and containing a proviso saying:\n'The privilege herein granted shall not be construed to interfere with the control of water for irrigation and other purposes under authority of the respective states or territories.'\n\n Of the legislation thus far recited it was said, in United States v. Rio Grande Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 706\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 770, 776 (43 L. Ed. 1136):\n'Obviously by these acts, so far as they extended, Congress recognized and assented to the appropriation of water in contravention of the common law rule as to continuous flow.'\n\n And again:\n'The obvious purpose of Congress was to give its assent, so far as the public lands were concerned, to any system, although in contravention to the common-law rule, which permitted the appropriation of those waters for legitimate industries.' \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 463]\n\u00a0\n June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, c. 1093, the National Reclamation Act ( Comp. St.  4700-4708), was passed, under which the United States entered upon the construction of extensive irrigation works to be used in the reclamation of large bodies of arid public lands in the Western States. Its eight section (Comp. St.  4707) declared:\n\n'Nothing in this act shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any state or territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation, or any vested right acquired thereunder, and the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out the provisions of this act, shall proceed in conformity with such laws, and nothing herein shall in any way affect any right of any state or of the federal government or of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate stream or the waters thereof: Provided, that the right to the use of water acquired under the provisions of this act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated, and beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.'\n\n The words which we have italicizen constitute the only instance, so far as we are advised, in which the legislation of Congress relating to the appropriation of water in the arid land region has contained any distinct mention of interstate streams. The explanation of this exceptional mention is to be found in the pendency in this court at that time of the case of Kansas v. Colorado, wherein the relative rights of the two states, the United States, certain Kansas riparians, and certain Colorado appropriators and users in and to the waters of the Arkansas river, an interstate stream, were thought to be involved. Congress was solicitous that all questions respecting interstate streams thought to be involved in that litigation should be left to judicial determination unaffected by the act-in other words, that the matter be left just as it was before. The words aptly reflect that purpose. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 464]\n\u00a0\n The decision in Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 U.S. 46\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 655, was a pioneer in its field. On some of the questions presented it was intended to be and is comprehensive, and on others it was intended to be within narrower limits, the court saying:\n'The views expressed in this opinion are to be confined to a case in which the facts and the local law of the two states are as here disclosed.'\n\n On full consideration it was broadly determined that a controversy between two states over the diversion and use of waters of a stream passing from one to the other 'makes a matter for investigation and determination by this court' in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, and also that the upper state on such a stream does not have such ownership or control of the waters flowing therein as entitles her to divert and use them regardless of any injury or prejudice to the rights of the lower state in the stream. And, on consideration of the particular facts disclosed and the local law of the two states, it was determined that Colorado was not taking more than what under the circumstances would be her share under an equitable apportionment.\n As respects the scope and interpretation of the ultimate conclusion in that case it should be observed, first, that the court was there concerned, as it said, with a controversy between two states, 'one recognizing generally the common-law rule of riparian rights' and the other the doctrine of appropriation; secondly, that the diversion complained of was not to a watershed from which none of the water could find its way into the complaining state, but quite to the contrary; and, thirdly, that what the complaining state was seeking was not to prevent a proposed inversion for the benefit of lands as yet unreclaimed, but to interfere with a diversion which had been practiced for years and under which many thousands of acres of unoccupied and barren lands had been reclaimed and made productive. In these circumstances, and after observing that the diminution in the flow of \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 465]\n\u00a0\n the river had resulted in 'perceptible injury' to portions of the valley in Kansas, but in 'little, if any, detriment' to the great body of the valley, the court said: 'It would seem equality of right and equity between the two states forbids any interference with the present withdrawal of water in Colorado for purposes of irrigation,' and that, if the depletion of the waters by Colorado should be increased, the time would come when Kansas might 'rightfully call for relief against the action of Colorado, its corporations and citizens in appropriating the waters of the Arkansas for irrigation purposes.' What was there said about 'equality of right' refers, as the opinion shows (\n206 U.S. 97\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 255), not to an equal division of the water, but to the equal level or plane on which all the states stand, in point of power and right, under our constitutional system.\n Like that case, the one now before us presents a controversy over the waters of an interstate stream. But here the controversy is between states in both of which the doctrine of appropriation has prevailed from the time of the first settlements, always has been applied in the same way, and had been recognized and sanctioned by the United States, the owner of the public lands. Here the complaining state is not seeking to impose a policy of her choosing on the other state, but to have the common policy which each enforces within her limits applied in determining their relative rights in the interstate stream. Nor is the United States seeking to impose a policy of its choosing on either state. All that it has done has been to recognize and give its sanction to the policy which each has adopted. Whether its public land holdings would enable it to go further we need not consider. And here the complaining state is not seeking to interfere with a diversion which has long been practiced and under which much reclamation has been effected, but to prevent a proposed diversion for the benefit of lands as yet unreclaimed.\n With this understanding of the case in hand, and of some of the matters in the light of which it should be con sidered, \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 466]\n\u00a0\n we take up the several contentions, before noticed, which are pressed on our attention.\n The contention of Colorado that she as a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in this interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice that this may work to others having rights in the stream below her boundary, cannot be maintained. The river throughout its course in both states is but a single stream, wherein each state has an interest which should be respected by the other. A like contention was set up by Colorado in her answer in Kansas v. Colorado and was adjudged untenable. Further consideration satisfies us that the ruling was right. It has support in other cases, of which Rickey Land & Cattle Co. v. Miller & Lux, \n218 U.S. 258\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 11; Bean v. Morris, \n221 U.S. 485\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 703; Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 331, and \n200 U.S. 496\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 268, and Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 U.S. 230\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488, are examples.\n The objection of Wyoming to the proposed diversion on the ground that it is to another watershed, from which she can receive no benefit, is also untenable. The fact that the diversion is to such a watershed has a bearing in another connection, but does not in itself constitute a ground for condemning it. In neither state does the right of appropriation depend on the place of use being within the same watershed. Diversions from one watershed to another are commonly made in both states and the practice is recognized by the decisions of their courts. Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co., 6 Colo. 443, 449; Thomas v. Guiraud, 6 Colo. 530; Hammond v. Rose, 11 Colo. 524, 19 Pac. 466, 7 Am. St. Rep. 258; Oppenlander v. Left Hand Ditch Co., 18 Colo. 142, 144, 31 Pac. 854; Moyer v. Preston, 6 Wyo. 308, 321, 44 Pac. 845, 71 Am. St. Rep. 914; Willey v. Decker, 11 Wyo. 496, 529-531, 73 Pac. 210, 100 Am. St. Rep. 939. And the evidence shows that diversions are made and recognized in both states, which in principle are not distinguishable from this; that is, where water is taken in one state from a watershed leading into \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 467]\n\u00a0\n the other state and conducted into a different watershed leading away from that state, and from which she never can receive any benefit. The principle of such diversions being recognized in both states, its application to this interstate stream does not in itself afford a ground for complaint, unless the practice in both be rejected in determining what, as between them, is reasonable and admissible as to this stream, which we think should not be done.\n We are thus brought to the question of the basis on which the relative rights of these states in the waters of this interstate stream should be determined. Should the doctrine of appropriation, which each recognizes and enforces within her borders, be applied? Or is there another basis which is more consonant with right and equity?\n The lands in both states are naturally arid, and the need for irrigation is the same in one as in the other. The lands were settled under the same public land laws, and their settlement was induced largely by the prevailing right to divert and use water for irrigation, without which the lands were of little value. Many of the lands were acquired under the Desert Land Act, which made reclamation by irrigation a condition to the acquisition. The first settlers located along the streams where water could be diverted and applied at small cost. Others with more means followed, and reclaimed lands farther away. Then companies with large capital constructed extensive canals and occasional tunnels, whereby water was carried to lands remote from the stream and supplied, for hire, to settlers who were not prepared to engage in such large undertakings. Ultimately, the demand for water being in excess of the dependable flow of the streams during the irrigation season, reservoirs were constructed, wherein water was impounded when not needed and released when needed, thereby measurably equalizing the natural flow. Such was the course of irrigation development in both \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 468]\n\u00a0\n states. It began in territorial days, continued without change after statehood, and was the basis for the large respect always shown for water rights. These constituted the foundation of all rural home building and agricultural development, and, if they were rejected now, the lands would return to their naturally arid condition, the efforts of the settlers and the expenditures of others would go for naught, and values mounting into large figures would be lost.\n In neither state was the right to appropriate water from this interstate stream denied. On the contrary, it was permitted and recognized in both. The rule was the same on both sides of the line. Some of the appropriations were made as much as 50 years ago, and many as much as 25. In the circumstances we have stated, why should not appropriations from this stream be respected, as between the two states, according to their several priorities, as would be done if the stream lay wholly within either state? By what principle of right or equity may either state proceed in disregard of prior appropriations in the other?\n Colorado answers that this is not a suit between private appropriators. This is true, but it does not follow that their situation and what has been accomplished by them for their respective states can be ignored. As respects Wyoming, the welfare, prosperity, and happiness of the people of the larger part of the Laramie valley, as also a large portion of the taxable resources of two counties, are dependent on the appropriations in that state. Thus the interests of the state are indissolubly linked with the rights of the appropriators. To the extent of the appropriation and use of the water in Colorado a like situation exists here.\n Colorado further answers that she can accomplish more with the water than Wyoming does or can; that she proposes to use it on lands in the Cache la Poudre valley; and \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 469]\n\u00a0\n that they with less water will produce more than the lands in the portion of the Laramie valley known as the Laramie Plains. It is true that irrigation in the Poudre valley has been carried to a higher state of development than elsewhere in the Rocky Mountain region, and that the lands of that valley lieat a lower altitude than do those in the Laramie Plains, and generally are better adapted to agriculture. In some parts they also require less water. It may be assumed that the lands intended to be reclaimed and irrigated in the Poudre valley conform to the general standard, although this is left uncertain. But for combined farming and stockraising those of the Laramie Plains offer opportunities and advantages which are well recognized. It is to this use that they chiefly are devoted. It is a recognized and profitable industry, has been carried on there for many years, and is of general economic value. Many of the original ranchmen still are engaged in it-some on the tracts where they first settled. With the aid of irrigation, native hay of a high quality, alfalfa, oats, and other forage are grown for winter feeding; the live stock being grazed most of the year on unirrigated areas and in the neighboring hills and mountains. In this way, not only are the irrigated tracts made productive, but the utility and value of the grazing areas are greatly enhanced. The same industry is carried on in the same way in sections of Colorado. In both states this is a purpose for which the right to appropriate water may be exercised, and no discrimination is made between it and other farming. Even in this suit Colorado is asserting appropriations of this class for 4,250 acres in the portion of the Laramie valley in that state, and is claiming under them an amount of water in excess of what she asserts will irrigate a like acreage in the Poudre valley.\n Some of the appropriations from the stream in Wyoming are used for agriculture alone. One of the large projects, dation from territorial days, and constructed at \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 470]\n\u00a0\n great cost, carries water from the river through a tunnel one-half mile long and canals several miles in length to the Wheatland district, where it is used in irrigating 30,000 acres, all of which are very successfully and profitably farmed in small tracts. This project uses one very large and one comparatively small reservoir for storing water and equalizing the natural flow.\n We conclude that Colorado's objections to the doctrine of appropriation as a basis of decision are not well taken, and that it furnishes the only basis which is consonant with the principles of right and equity applicable to such a controversy as this is. The cardinal rule of the doctrine is that priority of appropriation gives superiority of right. Each of these states applies and enforces this rule in her own territory, and it is the one to which intending appropriators naturally would turn for guidance. The principle on which it proceeds in not less applicable to interstate streams and controversies than to others. Both states pronounce the rule just and reasonable as applied to the natural conditions in that region, and to prevent any departure from it the people of both incorporated it into their Constitutions. It originated in the customs and usages of the people before either state came into existence, and the courts of both hold that their constitutional provisions are to be taken as recognizing the prior usage rather than as creating a new rule. These considerations persuade us that its application to such a controversy as is here presented cannot be other than eminently just and equitable to all concerned.\n In suits between appropriators from the same stream, but in different states recognizing the doctrine of appropriation, the question whether rights under such appropriations should be judged by the rule of priority has been considered by several courts, state and federal, and has been uniformly answered in the affirmative. Conant v. Deep Creek Irrigation Co., 23 Utah, 627, 631, 66 Pac. 188, 90 Am. St. Rep. 721; Willey v. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 471]\n\u00a0\n Decker, 11 Wyo. 496, 534-535, 73 Pac. 210, 100 Am. St. Rep. 939; Taylor v. Hulett, 15 Idaho, 265, 271, 97 Pac. 37, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 535; Howell v. Johnson (C. C.) 89 Fed. 556; Hoge v. Eaton (C. C.) 135 Fed. 411; Morris v. Bean (C. C.) 146 Fed. 423; Bean v. Morris, 159 Fed. 651, 86 C. C. A. 519. One of the cases came to this court, and the judgment below was affirmed. Bean v. Morris, \n221 U.S. 485\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 703. These decisions, although given in suits between individuals, tend strongly to support our conclusion, for they show that by common usage, as also by judicial pronouncement, the rule of priority is regarded in such states as having the same application to a stream flowing from one of them to another that it has to streams wholly within one of them.\n The remaining questions are largely matters of fact. The evidence is voluminous, some of it highly technical, and some quite conflicting. It has all been considered. The reasonable limits of an opinion do not admit of its extended discussion. We must be content to give our conclusions on the main questions, and make such references to and comment on what is evidential as will point to the grounds on which the conclusions on those questions rest. As to minor questions we can only state the ultimate facts as we find them from the evidence.\n The question first in order, and the one most difficult of solution, relates to the flow of the Laramie river, the common source of supply. The difficulty arises chiefly out of the fact that the flow varies greatly in the course of the year, and also from year to year.\n Colorado's evidence, which for convenlence we take up first, is directed to showing the average yearly flow of all years in a considerable period, as if that constituted a proper measure of the available supply. We think it is not a proper measure, and this because of the great variation in the flow. To be available in a practical sense, the supply must be fairly continuous and dependable. No doubt the natural flow can be materially conserved and equalized by means of storage reservoirs, but this has \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 472]\n\u00a0\n its limitations, both financial and physical. The construction of reservoirs of real capacity is attended with great expense, and unless an adequate return reasonably can be foreseen the expenditure is not justified and will not be made. The years of high water and those of low do not alternate. Often several of the same kind follow in succession. The evaporation of stored water in Colorado and Wyoming is from 5 to 6 feet per year. So, while it generally is practicable to store water in one part of the year for use in another, or in one year for use in the next, it often, if not generally, is impracticable to store it for longer periods. All this is recognized elsewhere in Colorado's evidence. One of her principal witnesses said:\n'With regard to financial practicability of construction of reservoirs on Poudre river capable of conserving extraordinary floods, will state that they call for an expenditure that could be utilized only occasionally. It would be similar to financial proposition of people in Florida preparing to heat their houses in the same manner as those in the northern part of the United States. For years of unusually high flow in the Poudre river, conservation works, to utilize the excess waters in that stream, would have to count on carrying water over more than one year. The utilization of this water means the presence of population on the land; that population must have a living from year to year, and they are not justified in going out on the land and settling to raise a crop only once in three or four years. They must have sufficient to make a living from one year to another, and consequently the investment must be such that there can be sufficient water every year to keep these people on the land, and when water can only be conserved once in every three to five years, there must be provision for carrying over water or the people cannot live. It is a question of population as well as investment. The population has to exist and stay on the ground. From standpoint of investment, conservation \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 473]\n\u00a0\n of flow such as extreme flow of 1884 would be impractical to the extent that it exceeded the ordinary high year. Of such character would be [also]$ the floods of 1885, 1900, and 1909, three [four]$ years in thirty.'\n\n The same witness further said:\n'Aside from reasons which I have given why reservoirs designed to catch only these rare high-water flows of Poudre river are not feasible, it is a fact that no farmer would be able to anticipate the high flow, and therfore could not depend at all upon water for irrigation until it reached him. If he undertook to so divert water, it would become a gamble rather than a safe guide for living.'\n\n Another of her witnesses said:\n'The present storage capacity in the Poudre valley is such that in some years the reservoirs are not all filled, while in some years they are filled and water runs to waste. ... It would not be possible to inaugurate a scheme in the Poudre valley to construct reservoirs to store water from one year of high flow to another where such water is the only source of supply, for the reservoirs would have to be constructed to hold the maximum amount, and if the water has to be carried over for three years the average diversion from the reservoir would be only one-third of its capacity, making the cost per acre prohibitive.'\n\n And still another of her witnesses, referring to the unused waters of the Poudre in years of high flow and also to what is contemplated by the defendants in respect of the Laramie, said:\n'The really dependabel water supply of the district2 will come from the Laramie river; the amount secured from the Poudre rixer fluctuation greatly and being used to augment the supply from the Laramie. There will \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 474]\n\u00a0\n be years when the supply from the Poudre river and its tributaries will be practically nothing. Our plans contemplate taking all the water that it is possible for us to take from the Laramie river each year. It is possible to get only a certain amount from that river, and I do not believe that we can absolutely depend on more than half the required amount from the Laramie river. The very great floods on that watershed we cannot consider, because we cannot construct works to take care of them.'\n\n In accord with these statements, bearing on what is susceptible of use in actual practice, is further evidence coming from Colorado's witnesses and exhibits to the effect that, notwithstanding the great need for water in the Poudre valley and the returns obtained from its use, large amounts of water pass down the stream without use or impounding in the years when the flow exceeds what is termed the average. With the high state of irrigation development in that valley the full capacity of the reservoir system there provided when the proof was taken was 146,655 acrefeet-an evidence of the limitation inhering in the practical storage of water from such streams.\n The Cache la Poudre river heads in the same mountain range as does the Laramie, and the conditions which make for a pronounced variation in the natural flow are largely the same with both. The following table compiled from data relating to the Cache la Poudre, furnished by Colorado, will be helpful in illustrating the view of the witnesses, and also ours ( we add the third and fourth columns): \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 475]\n\u00a0\n VARIATION IN ANNUAL NET DISCHARGE OF CACHE LA POUDRE RIVER\n April to October, both Inclusive, for 30 years.

Average, 262,583, omitting 1884, 1885, 1900, and 1909\n\n\n This table shows that during 30 years-1884 to 1913-the yearly flow of the Cache la Poudre ranged from 151,636 to 666,466 acre-feet, that in 16 of the 30 it fell below the average, and that 8 of the 16 \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 476]\n\u00a0\n were in immediate succession. Obviously it is not financially practicable, even by means of reservoirs, to equalize the flow of a stream subject to such variation, so that it will have a fairly constant and dependable flow at the average of all years. For further illustration we have taken the average of the 26 years remaining after excluding the 4 described by the witness as extraordinary (these being left to take the average of the others), and on that basis have made a computation of the excess and deficiency, which is shown in the fourth column of the table. Even on this basis there were 13 years in which the flow was below the average, and of these 6 came in immediate succession. In 4 the deficiency exceeded 100,000 acre-feet, and of the 4 only one followed a year in which there was an excess sufficient, if carried over in storage, to cover the deficiency. This suffices to show that the average of all years is far from being a proper or safe measure of the available supply. An intending irrigator, acquiring a water right based on such a measure, would be almost certainly confronted with drought when his need for water was greatest. Crops cannot be grown on expectations of average flows which do not come, nor on recollections of unusual flows which have passed down the stream in prior years. Only when the water is actually applied does the soil respond.\n We have dealt with the matter of the average flow at this length, because throughout Colorado's evidence and in her briefs it is treated as if it were a proper measure of the supply available for practical use. It is there applied to the Laramie, not only directly, but indirectly, by increasing the gaged flow for a particular year or period by percentages derived by comparing the flow of the Poudre for that year or period with the average for the 30 years, including those in which the flow was so extraordinary that concededly much of it neither was nor could be used. Thus water which is not part of the available supply is counted in measuring that supply. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 477]\n\u00a0\n When the evidence was taken, in 1913 and 1914, the Laramie had not been gaged so thoroughly nor for so long a period as had the Cache la Poudre. Such gaging as had occurred had been done at different places in different periods, partly by the United States Geological Survey, partly by Colorado, and partly by Wyoming. Some of the gaging stations were in Colorado, but most were in Wyoming. The latter included Woods, nine miles north of the state boundary, and the Pioneer Dam, four miles north of Woods. The evidence centered largely around the flow and gaging at these places. Colorado's chief witness prepared and presented a table, based on data, drawn from various sources, and bearing on the flow at Woods from April to October, both inclusive, for several years, and made this table the principal basis of his testimony concerning the flow of the stream in that vicinity. We here reproduce the material part of the table, the third and fourth columns being ours:\n Discharge of Laramie River, Woods, Wyo. April to October, Both Inclusive, for 9 Years.

Average, 174,509, excluding 1899. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 478]\n\u00a0\n The data covered two widely separated periods, one of 6 years and the other of 3. The witness took the average of the 9 years, which he gave as 198,545 acre-feet, and made this the basis of further calculations. He estimated that the usual flow for the other months was one-tenth of that for the full year, or, putting it in another way, one-ninth of that from April to October, both inclusive, and on this basis he added to his average 21,945 acre-feet, making 220,490. Consulting the Cache la Poudre table, set forth above, he concluded that the 9 years, in combination, fell below the full average for the 30 years covered by that table, and to bring the 9 years up to a 30-year average he added 9,510 acre-feet, making 230,000. Some water from Wyoming enters the river between the state boundary and Woods, and for this he deducted 13,000 acre-feet, leaving 217, 000. Then, making a reservation as to Sand creek, to be considered presently, he concluded that 217,000 acre-feet was the average yearly flow in that section of the river. He called it the 'normal' flow, an evident misnomer. This did not include water diverted in Colorado, under recognized Colorado appropriations, which does not reach Wyoming.\n Even if the computation was to be made along the lines of something approaching a general average, we think the witness's computation and conclusion are subject to objection in particulars which we proceed to state.\n The table shows that the flow for 1899 was extraordinary, so much so that it should have been excluded in computing the average and left to take the general level of the others. Its flow was 216,221 acre-feet in excess of their average. The excess added nothing to the available supply- that which in practice could be used. The flow for the next year was such that it required no augmentation from 1899. So, the inclusion of 1899 in the computation was, in effect, taking what was not available as a \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 479]\n\u00a0\n measure of what was. The error raised the average of the other years 24, 036 acre-feet, and was carried into the ultimate conclusion.\n We do not doubt that it was admissible to compare the data relating to the Laramie with that relating to the Cache la Poudre, and to give effect to such conclusions as reasonably were to be drawn from the comparison; but we think there was no justification for the addition which was made to bring the 9 years up to the standard of an average year among the 30 covered by the Cache la Poudre table. The addition tended to distort rather than to reflect the available supply. Looking at the Cache la Poudre table, it is evident that the 9 years, in combination, would not have appeared short in flow, had the 4 extraordinary years in the 30 been excluded, as they should have been. Besides, a comparison of the two tables shows that the variation in yearly flow in the two streams is not the same, and that the difference is such as to preclude a nice calculation such as was here made on the basis of an assumed uniformity. To illustrate: According to one table the flow of the Poudre from April to October, both inclusive, in 1900 was 85,982 acre-feet in excess of that for the same months in 1899, while according to the other the flow of the Laramie for those months in 1899 was 142,625 acre-feet in excess of that for the corresponding period in 1900, and according to one table the flow of the Poudre for those months in 1913 was 73.2 per cent. of that for the same part of 1912, while according to the other the flow of the Laramie for those months in 1913 was 46.5 per cent. of that for the same part of 1912.\n Assuming that 13,000 acre-feet enter the river from Wyoming between the state boundary and Woods, and are part of the river at the latter point, we think this water should not have been deducted. It is part of the supply available to satisfy appropriations from the stream in Wyoming. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 480]\n\u00a0\n The witness treated the flow from April to October, both inclusive, in 1912 as being 213,407 acre-feet, and the flow in the same months in 1913 as being 99,221 acre-feet. In this we think he erred. The evidence establishes that the flow in the first period was not more than 191,820 acre-feet and in the second was not more than 94,369. Even with the year 1899 excluded, this error increased the average 3,305 acre-feet.\n If we exclude the extraordinary flow of 1899, make the needed correction in the flow of 1912 and 1913, and assume the accuracy of the other data, the average becomes 171,204 acre-feet, instead of 198,545, as given by the witness. This requires that the 21,945 acre-feet which were added to cover the flow for the five other months be reduced to 19,023.\n When these corrections are made in the witness' data and computation, the result is changed from 217,000 acre-feet to 190,227.\n But we are of opinion that the computation and conclusion of the witness, even when revised in the way we have indicated, are based too much on the average flow, and not enough on the unalterable need for a supply which is fairly constant and dependable, or is susceptible of being made so by storage and conservation within practicable limits. By this it is not meant that known conditions must be such as give assurance that there will be no deficiency even during long periods, but rather that a supply which is likely to be intermittent, or to be materially deficient at relatively short intervals, does not meet the test of practical availability. As we understand it, substantial stability in the supply is essential to successful reclamation and irrigation. The evidence shows that this is so, and it is fully recognized in the literature on the subject.\n The same witness prepared and submitted another table embodying all the data he was able to secure from records \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 481]\n\u00a0\n of past gaging and measurements at Woods. This included three years not shown in the nine-year table. They and their recorded flow from April to October, both inclusive, were: 1889, 132,349 acre-feet; 1890, 168,406 acre- feet, and 1891, 207,146 acre-feet. The witness pronounced the data for these years less accurate than that for the others, and, while his reason for doing so does not clearly appear, we shall assume he was right. Had the three years been included in the nine-year table that would have reduced the average from 198,545 to 189,371 acre-feet, counting all years, and from 174,509 to 171,066 acre-feet, counting all but 1899. It, however, would not have shown another year with a flow as low as that of 1913, nor as low as that of 1896.\n Colorado presented other evidence in the way of general estimates, results of very fragmentary gaging, and opinions based on rough measurements of snowdrifts in the mountainous area about the head of the stream; but we put all of this aside as being of doubtful probative value at best, and far less persuasive than the evidence we have been discussing.\n Wyoming's evidence was based on the same recorded data that were used by Colorado, and also on actual gaging and measurements by an experienced hydrographer covering the period beginning April 1, 1912, and ending April 30, 1914. Shortly stated, her evidence was to the effect that the actual measured flow at the Pioneer Dam, four miles below Woods, was 198,867 acre- feet from April to December, both inclusive, in 1912, was 109,593 acre- feet for all of 1913, and was 19,181 acre-feet for the first four months of 1914; that the flow for 1912 was somewhat above the average, counting all years; that the flow for 1913 was somewhat more than 50 per cent. of the average; and that the average at Woods and in that vicinity, counting all years, was approximately 200,000 acre-feet. Wyoming's chief witness, the hydrographer, submitted \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 482]\n\u00a0\n the following table giving the results of his gaging and measurements at the Pioneer Dam:\n Discharge of Laramie River at Pioneer Dam, near Woods, Wyo. (Including Diversion Just Above Dam by Pioneer Canal), IN ACRE FEET []\n 1912 1913 1914 [] January - 2,650 3,283 February - 2,355 3,088 March - 3,296 4,003 April 5,534 12,674 8,807 May 40,643 38,307 - June 91,874 26,598 - July 34,863 6,825 - August 7,809 3,130 - September 4,641 3,023 - October 6,456 3,812 - November 4,403 3,677 - December 2,644 3,246 - []\n Total 198,867 109,593 19,181 []\n The evidence does not permit us to doubt the accuracy of these data. They were obtained by work which is shown to have been painstakenly and conscientiously done by one fully competent to do it. The place at which it was done was well adapted to obtaining accurate results, and the observations were continuous, not merely occasional or intermittent.\n As the gaging did not cover the first three months of 1912, it is necessary to arrive at the flow for those months. The proof shows that the flow for the same months in 1914 fairly may be taken for the purpose. That was 10,374 acre-feet, the addition making 209,241 acre-feet for 1912. The flow for 1913 was 109,593 acre-feet. Both should be increased 4,000 acre- feet to cover water diverted between Woods and the Pioneer Dam and not returning \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 483]\n\u00a0\n to the stream above the gaging station. This gives a total of 213,241 acre- feet for 1912 and 113,593 acre-feet for 1913. Tested by the flow of these years, the available supply would be 163,417 acrefeet; that is to say, on that basis the excess in 1912 would match the deficiency in 1913. But a survey of more than two years is essential in arriving at a fair conclusion respecting the available supply. A year of low flow is not always preceded by one of high or moderate flow, as was the case with 1912 and 1913.\n In diverting and applying water in irrigation, there is a material loss through evaporation, seepage, and otherwise which is unavoidable. The amount varies according to the conditions-chiefly according to the distance the water is carried through canals and ditches and the length of time it is held in storage. Where the places of use are in the same watershed and relatively near the stream, as is true of the lands on the Laramie Plains served by the greater part of the Wyoming appropriations, a substantial amount of water percolates back into the stream from irrigated areas and becomes available for further use lower down the stream. This is called return water. The amount varies considerably and there is no definite data on the subject. As respects irrigation on the Laramie Plains above the Wheatland diversion, the evidence satisfies us that the return water will certainly more than counterbalance the loss through evaporation and otherwise when the period of storage is not more than from one year to the next.\n What has now been said covers the substance of the evidence, as we regard it, bearing on the available supply at Woods and in that vicinity; that is to say, the supply remaining after the recognized Colorado appropriations are satisfied.\n We already have indicated that, as to such a stream as this, the average flow of all years, high and low, cannot \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 484]\n\u00a0\n be taken as a proper or reasonable measure of what is available for practical use. What, then, is the amount which is available here? According to the general consensus of opinion among practical irrigators and experienced irrigation engineers, the lowest natural flow of the years is not the test. In practice they proceed on the view that within limits, financially and physically feasible, a fairly constant and dependable flow materially in excess of the lowest may generally be obtained by means of reserviors adapted to conserving and equalizing the natural flow, and we regard this view as reasonable.\n But Wyoming takes the position that she should not be required to provide storage facilities in order that Colorado may obtain a larger amount of water from the common supply than otherwise would be possible. In a sense this is true, but not to the extent of requiring that the lowest natural flow be taken as the test of the available supply. The question here is not what one state should do for the other, but what one state exercise her relative rights in the waters of this interstate stream. Both are interested in the stream, and both have great need for the water. Both subscribe to the doctrine of appropriation, and by that doctrine rights to water are measured by what is reasonably required and applied. Both states recognize that conservation within practicable limits is essential, in order that needless waste may be prevented and the largest feasible use may be secured. This comports with the all-pervading spirit of the doctrine of appropriation, and takes appropriate heed of the natural necessities out of which it arose. We think that doctrine lays on each of these states a duty to exercise her right reasonably and in a manner calculated to conserve the common supply. Notwithstanding her present contention. Wyoming has in fact proceeded on this line, for, as the proof shows, her appropriators, with her sanction, have provided and have in service reservoir facilities which are adapted for the \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 485]\n\u00a0\n purpose and reasonably sufficient to meet its requirements.\n There is one respect, requiring mention, in which Colorado's situation differs materially from that of Wyoming. The water to satisfy the Colorado appropriations is, and in the nature of things must be, diverted in Colorado at the head of the stream, and because of this those appropriations will not be affected by any variation in the yearly flow, but will receive their full measure of water in all years. On the other hand, the Wyoming appropriations will receive the water only after it passes down into that state, and must bear whatever of risk is incident to the variation in the natural flow. Of course, this affords no reason for underestimating the available supply, but it does show that to overestimate it will work particular injury to Wyoming.\n The lowest established flow was that of 1913. There is no claim or proof that in any other year the flow fell so low. Had there been others, some proof of it doubtless would have been presented. This is also true of the very low flow of 1896. Therefore we think it reasonably may be assumed that the flow of those years was so exceptional that it is not likely to recur, save at long intervals.\n We conclude in view of all the evidence, and of the several considerations we have stated, that the natural and varying flow of this stream at Woods, which is after the recognized Colorado appropriations are satisfied, is susceptible by means of practicabel storage and conservation of being converted into a fairly constant and dependable flow of 170,000 acre-feet per year, but not more. This we hold to be the available supply at that point after the recognized Colorado diversions are made. The amount may seem large, but, considering what may be accomplished with practicable storage facilities, such as are already provided, and the use which may be made of \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 486]\n\u00a0\n the return water, we are persuaded that the amount, while closely pressing the outside limit, is not too large.\n The problem to be worked out in obtaining a fairly dependable supply in that amount is measurably illustrated by the following table covering all the years for which the evidence supplies the requisite data, the flow during the missing months being fairly estimated:\n []\n Variance Variance from from Average Variance Average of All from Year.

Average 189,925, including all years but 1899.\n\n It of course is true that the variation in the flow will not always be just what it was in the years covered by the table, and yet the data obtained by the gaging and measurements in those years show better than anything else what reasonably may be expected in the future. We recognize that the problem which the table is intended to illustrate is not a simple one and that to work it out will involve the exercise of both skill and care. But in this it is not unlike other problems of similar moment. Our belief gathered from all the evidence is that, with the attention which rightly should be bestowed on a problem of such moment, it can be successfully solved within the limits of what is financially and physically practicable. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 487]\n\u00a0\n As to Sand creek, Colorado's witness regarded it as a tributary of the river, and estimated its yearly flow at 17,000 acre-feet. The creek rises in Colorado, extends into the Laramie Plains in Wyoming, and discharges into Hutton Lake, a few miles from the river. In exceptional years-about one in five-the waters of the creek overflow the lake for a short period and find their way over the prairie into the river. Otherwise the river receives no water from the creek. The proof of this is direct and undisputed. The creek is nominally a tributary of the river, but only that. Besides, its flow does not appear to have been measured. The witness merely estimated it at what he thought would be the natural run-off of the adjacent territory. Other evidence suggests that the estimate is too high, but this we need not consider. A substantial part of the flow is diverted, through what is known as the Divide Ditch, for use in irrigating lands in Colorado, and the evidence suggests, if it does not establish, that existing appropriations in the two states take the entire flow. For these reasons the waters of this creek cannot be regarded as a factor in this controversy.\n After passing Woods, and while traversing the territory wherein are the Wyoming appropriations with which we are concerned, the Laramie receives one large and some very small additions to its waters.\n The large addition comes from the Little Laramie, a stream whose source and entire length are in Wyoming. Its natural flow is a little more than one-half of that of the main stream at Woods, and is subject to much the same variations. Part of its flow is used under appropriations along its course, and the remainder passes into the main stream. Including what is appropriated along its course, and excluding minor contributions by small creeks after it gets well away from its headwaters, we think the amount available for practical use is 93,000 acre-feet per year.\n None of the small tributaries, whether of the Laramie or the Little Laramie, adds much to the available supply. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 488]\n\u00a0\n Their natural flow is small. As to some it is all used under old appropriations, as to some it is partly used under such appropriations, and as to some it is only seasonal; the channels being dry much of the year. Some creeks spoken of in Colorado's evidence as tributaries are otherwise shown not to be such, but to deliver their waters into lakes or ponds not connected with either of the principal streams. Colorado's evidence also takes into account some tributaries which discharge into the Laramie below the points of diversion of all the Wyoming appropriations with which we are concerned. One, of which much is said in the evidence, is the Sybille. It reaches the Laramie below the diversion for the Wheatland district (the lowest diversion we are to consider), but in its course passes through that district. A small part of its flow is used in that district, and it is not practicable to use more. What is used should, for present purposes, be treated as if it reached the Laramie above the Wheatland diversion. Wyoming contends that none of these small tributaries, other than the Sybille, contributes any dependable amount to the available supply. We think there is in the aggregate a fairly dependable contribution of 25,000 acrefeet, but not more.\n It results that, in our opinion, the entire supply available for the proposed Colorado appropriation and the Wyoming appropriations, down to and including the diversion for the Wheatland district, is 288,000 acrefeet.\n In contending for a larger finding, Colorado points to the issue by Wyoming's state engineer of permits, so called, for appropriations in excess of that amount, and insists that these permits constitute solemn adjudications by that officer that the supply is adequate to cover them. But in this the nature of the permits is misapprehended. In fact and in law they are not adjudications, but mere licenses to appropriate, if the requisite amount of water be there. As to many nothing ever is done under them by \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 489]\n\u00a0\n the intending appropriators. In such cases there is no appropriation, and even in others the amount of the appropriation turns on what is actually done under the permit. In late years the permits relating to these streams have contained a provision, saying:\n'The records of the state engineer's office show the waters of [the particular stream] to be largely appropriated. The appropriator under the permit is hereby notified of this fact, and the issuance of this permit grants only the right to divert and use the surplus or waste water of the stream and confers no rights which will interfere with or impair the use of water by prior appropriators.'\n\n It therefore is plain that these permits have no such probative force as Colorado seeks to have attributed to them.\n Colorado also comments on the amount of water stored in Wyoming reservoirs in 1912 and seeks to draw from this an inference that the available supply was greater than we have indicated. But the inference is not justified, and for these reasons: First, a part of what was stored was dead water; that is, was below the level from which water could be drawn off and conducted to the places of use. This is a matter commonly experienced in the selection and use of reservoir sites. Secondly, the flow of 1912 was above what could be depended on, and prudence required that a substantial part be carried over to meet a possible shortage in the succeeding year. And, thirdly, the evidence shows that in 1912 the storing process was improvidently carried to a point which infringed the rights of small appropriators who were without storage facilities.\n The available supply-the 288,000 acre-feet-is not sufficient to satisfy the Wyoming appropriations dependent thereon and also the proposed Colorado appropriation, so it becomes necessary to consider their relative priorities.\n There are some existing Colorado appropriations having priorities entitling them to precedence over many of the \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 490]\n\u00a0\n Wyoming appropriations. These recognized Colorado appropriations are 18, 000 acre-feet for what is known as the Skyline Ditch, and 4,250 acrefeet for the irrigation of that number of acres of native hay meadows in the Laramie valley in Colorado; the 4,250 acre-feet being what Colorado's chief witness testifies is reasonably required for the purpose, although a larger amount is claimed in the state's answer. These recognized Colorado appropriations, aggregating 22,250 acre-feet, are not to be deducted from the 288,000 acre-feet; that being the available supply after they are satisfied. Nor is Colorado's appropriation from Sand creek to be deducted; that creek, as we have shown, not being a tributary of the Laramie.\n The proposed Colorado appropriation which is in controversy here is spoken of in the evidence as the Laramie-Poudre tunnel diversion and is part of an irrigation project known as the Laramie-Poudre project. Colorado insists that this proposed appropriation takes priority, by relation, as of August 25, 1902, and Wyoming that the priority can relate only to the latter part of 1909. The true date is a matter of importance, because some large irrigation works were started in Wyoming between the dates mentioned, were diligently carried to completion, and are entitled to priorities as of the dates when they were started.\n The Laramie-Poudre project is composed of several units, originally distinct, which underwent many changes before they were brought together in a single project. In its final form the project is intended to divert water by means of a tunnel from the Laramie river into the Poudre watershed, there to unite that water with water taken from the Cache la Poudre river, and then to convey the water many miles to the lower part of the Poudre valley, where it is to be used in reclaiming and irrigating a body of land comtaining 125,000 acres. It is a large and ambitious project, whose several parts, as finally brought \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 491]\n\u00a0\n together, are adjusted to the attainment of that purpose. The parts were separately conceived, each having a purpose of its own. The project now is intended to draw on two independent sources of supply, each in a separate watershed. \n3\n The appropriations are necessarily distinct. Neither adds anything to, nor subtracts anything from, the status of the other. We are concerned with only one of them.\n The proposed tunnel diversion from the Laramie was conceived as a possibility by Wallace A. Link in 1897, and was explained by him to Abraham I. Akin in the spring of 1902. Later in the year they visited the headwaters of the two streams, looked over the ground, and agreed that Link's idea was a good one, that the undertaking was large, and that they were without the means to carry it through. They concluded to promote the project together, and, thinking their chances of success would be improved by it, they also concluded to construct a ditch, known as the Upper Rawah, from the Laramie valley to a connection with an existing ditch, called the Skyline, and to take water through these ditches into the Cache la Poudre valley and there sell it. By this they hoped to demonstrate that water was obtainable from that source and to obtain money to be used in promoting their project. The Skyline was a fair-sized ditch leading over a low part of the divide to a branch of the Poudre, and they \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 492]\n\u00a0\n arranged with is owner for the carriage, on a percentage basis, of water from their ditch when constructed. They also conceived that the ditch could be used advantageously in collecting and carrying water to be sent through the tunnel, if and when the tunnel diversion was effected. In 1902, beginning August 25, they surveyed the line of the Rawah, and in October of that year filed a statement of claim under it in the state engineer's office. In the statement they said nothing about a tunnel diversion, and made claim only to the amount of water expected to be carried through the Rawah, and to the use of certain lakes or natural reservoirs for storage purposes. No work was done on the ditch that year. In 1903 they cleared some of the land over which it was to run, but did no excavating. In 1904 they constructed 6,000 feet of the ditch, and did more clearing. No work was done on it in 1905 or 1906. Further work was done in 1907, and some washouts were repaired in 1908. That was the last work on the Rawah. Much more than one-half of the ditch was left unconstructed. No water was delivered through it to the Skyline, nor was any sold or used. Nothing appears to have been done with the lakes or natural reservoirs.\n In 1903 Link and Akin gave to each of three others a one-fifth share in their project, in return for which the new partners were to carry on solicitations to get capitalists interested and to raise money. The results of the solicitations were disappointing, but some investors were brought in and became concerned about the preliminary plans. Differences of opinion arose and had to be dealt with. The plans were examined and re- examined, alternative modes and places of diversion were considered and investigated, particular features were eliminated and others added, and in 1909, but not before, the project was definitely brought into its present form. A short reference to some of the details will serve to make this plain. \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 493]\n\u00a0\n In the Upper Rawah filing of October, 1902, nothing was said about the proposed tunnel diversion, but a claim was made to the use of certain lakes or natural reservoirs described as having an aggregate capacity of 325,000,000 cubic feet. The tunnel diversion was merely a mental conception until 1904. In March of that year a survey was made of a tunnel site, a ditch from the West fork of the Laramie to the East fork, and a channel reservoir on the East fork above the tunnel site, and in May following a statement of claim under them was filed, in which the estimated cost of the tunnel and ditch was given as $189,200 and that of the reservoir as $20,000. Later in 1904 a survey was made of a tunnel site, three collecting ditches, and two pipe lines, and in October of that year a statement of claim under them was filed, in which the estimated cost of the tunnel, ditches, and pipe lines was given as $375,000. The location and dimensions of the tunnel in the second survey differed from those in the first. The difference was not pronounced, and yet was a real change. In September, 1906, another statement of claim was filed covering the Upper Rawah Ditch, the lakes connected therewith and the tunnel. This statement declared that the lakes were to be so enlarged that they would have an aggregate capacity of 1,250,000,000 cubic feet, instead of 325,000, 000, as stated in the filing of 1902, and it again changed the location and dimensions of the tunnel, this time more than before.\n In 1905 and 1906 surveys were made to find a route for an open canal from the Laramie around the mountains, through a portion of Wyoming and back to Colorado, which would avoid the construction of a tunnel and the maintenance of ditches in the higher mountain levels, and in 1908 a statement of claim covering such a canal was filed, as was also a claim covering a large channel reservoir nine miles down the stream from the tunnel site. The estimated cost of the canal was given as $1,000,000 \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 494]\n\u00a0\n and that of the reservoir as $200,000. The plan evidenced by these filings was that of impounding the water in the reservoir and liberating it in an equalized flow into the canal, which was to carry it into the Poudre watershed without the aid of a tunnel. Late in 1908 and in the fore part of 1909 another survey along the same general line and with the same purpose was made at a cost of $15,000. Early in 1909 a statement of claim was filed covering a proposed reservoir near the tunnel site, the cost being estimated at $200,000.\n In 1907 the Laramie-Poudre Reservoirs & Irrigation Company succeeded to whatever rights the promoters had acquired up to that time, and all subsequent surveys, investigations, and filings were made by it. In April, 1909, the Greeley-Poudre Irrigation District, within which the water is intended to be used, was organized. At that time sufficient capital had not been obtained to carry the project through in any form. In September following the irrigation company and the irrigation district entered into a tentative contract, under which the company was to consummate the project in its present form, and, after doing the construction work, was to transfer the property to the district. Payment therefor was to be made in interestbearing bonds of the district. By a vote taken the next month, the district ratified the contract and authorized the issue of the bonds. About the last of that month the work of boring the tunnel and making the diversion was begun.\n It is manifest from this historical outline that the question of whether, and also how, this proposed appropriation should be made remained an open one until the contract with the irrigation district was made and ratified in 1909. Up to that time the whole subject was at large. There was no fixed or definite plan. It was all in an inceptive and formative stage-investigations being almost constantly in progress to determine its feasibility and \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 495]\n\u00a0\n whether changes and alternatives should be adopted rather than the primary conception. It had not reached a point where there was a fixed and definite purpose to take it up and carry it through. An appropriation does not take priority by relation as of a time anterior to the existence of such a purpose.\n It no doubt it ture that the original promoters intended all along to make a large appropriation from the Laramie by some means, provided the requisite capital could be obtained, but this is an altogether inadequate basis for applying the doctrine of relation.\n No separate appropriation was effected by what was done on the Upper Rawah Ditch. The purpose to use it in connection with the Skyline was not carried out, but abandoned. This, as Link testified, was its 'principal' purpose. The purpose to make it an accessory of the large project was secondary and contingent. Therefore the work on it cannot be taken as affecting or tolling back the priority of that project.\n Actual work in making the tunnel diversion was begun, as before shown, about the last of October, 1909. Thereafter it was prosecuted with much diligence, and in 1911, when this suit was brought, it had been carried so nearly to a state of completion that the assumption reasonably may be indulged that, but for the suit, the appropriation soon would have been perfected. We conclude that the appropriation should be accorded a priority by relation as of the latter part of October, 1909, when the work was begun.\n Applying a like rule to the Wyoming appropriations, several of them must be treated as relating to later dates, and therefore as being junior to that appropriation. Some of the projects in that state are founded on a plurality of appropriations, a part of which are senior and a part junior to that one.\n The evidence shows that the Wyoming appropriations having priorities senior to the one in Colorado, and which \n\n[259 U.S. 419, 496]\n\u00a0\n are dependent on the available supply before named, cover 181,500 acres of land, and that the amount of water appropriated and reasonably required for the irrigation of these lands is 272,500 acre-feet. A much larger amount is claimed, but our finding restricts the amount to what the evidence shows is reasonably required, which is 1 acre-foot per acre for the larger part of the lands, 2 acre-feet per acre for a part, and 2 1\/2 acre-feet per acre for the remainder.\n As the available supply is 288,000 acrefeet, and the amount covered by senior appropriations in Wyoming is 272,500 acre-feet, there remain 15, 500 acre-feet which are subject to this junior appropriation in Colorado. The amount sought to be diverted and taken under it is much larger.\n A decree will accordingly be entered enjoining the defendants from diverting or taking more than 15,500 acre-feet per year from the Laramie river by means of or through the so-called Laramie-Poudre project.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Final decree modified.

We estimated that the amount of water available outside of the Laramie river source would be between 80,000 and 100,000 acre-feet per annum as an average.' \n\n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WYOMING v.

He applied, on October 16, 1914, to the United States District Court for the Territory of Hawaii to be admitted as a citizen of the United States. His petition was opposed by the United States District Attorney for the District of Hawaii. Including the period of his residence in Hawaii appellant had continuously resided in the United States for 20 years. He was a graduate of the Berkeley, Cal., high school, had been nearly three years a student in the University of California, had educated his children in American schools, his family had attended American churches and he had maintained the use of the English language in his home. That he was well qualified by character and education for citizenship is conceded.\n The District Court of Hawaii, however, held that, having been born in Japan and being of the Japanese race, \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n he was not eligible to naturalization under section 2169 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4358), and denied the petition. Thereupon the appellant brought the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and that court has certified the following questions, upon which it desires to be instructed:\n'1. Is the act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stats. at Large, pt. 1, p. 596), providing 'for a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens' complete in itself, or is it limited by section 2169 of the Revised Statutes of the United States?\n\n'2. Is one who is of the Japanese race and born in Japan eligible to citizenship under the naturalization laws?\n\n'3. If said act of June 29, 1906, is limited by section 2169 and naturalization is limited to aliens being free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent, is one of the Japanese race, born in Japan, under any circumstances eligible to naturalization?'\n\n These questions for purposes of discussion may be briefly restated:\n\n 1. \nIs the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906 (Comp. St.  4351 et seq.), limited by the provisions of section 2169 of the Revised Statutes of the United States?\n\n 2. \nIf so limited, is the appellant eligible to naturalization under that section?\n First. Section 2169 is found in title XXX of the Revised Statutes, under the heading 'Naturalization,' and reads as follows:\n'The provisions of this title shall apply to aliens, being free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.'\n\n The act of June 29, 1906, entitled 'An act to establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to provide for a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n throughout the United States,' consists of 31 sections and deals primarily with the subject of procedure. There is nothing in the circumstances leading up to or accompanying the passage of the act which suggests that any modification of section 2169, or of its application, was contemplated.\n The report of the House Committee on Naturalization and Immigration, recommending its passage, contains this statement:\n'It is the opinion of your committee that the frauds and crimes which have been committed in regard to naturalization have resulted more from a lack of any uniform system of procedure in such matters than from any radical defect in the fundamental principles of existing law governing in such matters. The two changes which the committee has recommended in the principles controlling in naturalization matters and which are embodied in the bill submitted herewith are as follows: First, the requirement that before an alien can be naturalized he must be able to read, either in his own language or in the English language and to speak or understand the English language; and, second, that the alien must intend to reside permanently in the United States before he shall be entitled to naturalization.'\n\n This seems to make it quite clear that no change of the fundamental character here involved was in mind.\n Section 26 of the Act (Comp. St.  4381) expressly repeals sections 2165, 2167, 2168, 2173 of title XXX, the subject-matter thereof being covered by new provisions. The sections of title XXX remaining without repeal are: Section 2166, relating to honorably discharged soldiers; section 2169 (Comp. St.  4358), now under consideration; section 2170 ( section 4360), requiring five years' residence prior to admission; section 2171 (section 4352\n\n[260 U.S. 178, 11]\n\u00a0\n), forbidding the admission of alien enemies; section 2172 (section 4367), relating to the status of children of naturalized persons; and section 2174 (section 4352\n\n[260 U.S. 178, 8]\n\u00a0\n), making special provision in respect of the naturalization of seamen.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in section 2169 which is repugnant to anything in the act of 1906. Both may stand and be given effect. It is clear, therefore, that there is no repeal by implication.\n But it is insisted by appellant that section 2169, by its terms is made applicable only to the provisions of title XXX, and that it will not admit of being construed as a restriction upon the act of 1906. Since section 2169, it is in effect argued, declares that 'the provisions of this title shall apply to aliens being free white persons, ...' it should be confined to the classes provided for in the unrepealed sections of that title, leaving the act of 1906 to govern in respect of all other aliens, without any restriction except such as may be imposed by that act itself.\n It is contended that, thus construed, the act of 1906 confers the privilege of naturalization without limitation as to race, since the general introductory words of section 4 (Comp. St.  4352) are:\n'That an alien may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States in the following manner, and not otherwise.'\n\n But, obviously, this clause does not relate to the subject of eligibility but to the 'manner,' that is, the procedure, to be followed. Exactly the same words are used to introduce the similar provisions contained in section 2165 of the Revised Statutes. In 1790 the first naturalization act provided that--\n'Any alien being a free white person ... may be admitted to become a citizen. ...' 1 Stat. 103, c. 3.\n\n This was subsequently enlarged to include aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent. These provisions were restated in the Revised Statutes, so that section 2165 included only the procedural portion, while the substantive parts were carried into a separate section ( 2169) and the words 'An alien' substituted for the words 'Any alien.'\n In all of the naturalization acts from 1790 to 1906 the privilege of naturalization was confined to white persons \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n (with the addition in 1870 of those of African nativity and descent), although the exact wording of the various statutes was not always the same. If Congress in 1906 desired to alter a rule so well and so long established it may be assumed that its purpose would have been definitely disclosed and its legislation to that end put in unmistakable terms.\n The argument that, because section 2169 is in terms made applicable only to the title in which it is found, it should now be confined to the unrepealed sections of that title, is not convincing. The persons entitled to naturalization under these unrepealed sections include only honorably discharged soldiers and seamen who have served three years on board an American vessel, both of whom were entitled from the beginning to admission on more generous terms than were accorded to other aliens. It is not conceivable that Congress would deliberately have allowed the racial limitation to continue as to soldiers and seamen to whom the statute had accorded an especially favored status, and have removed it as to all other aliens. Such a construction cannot be adopted unless it be unavoidable.\n The division of the Revised Statutes into titles and chapters is chiefly a matter of convenience, and reference to a given title or chapter is simply a ready method of identifying the particular provisions which are meant. The provisions of title XXX affected by the limitation of section 2169, originally embraced the whole subject of naturalization of aliens. The generality of the words in section 2165, 'An alien may be admitted, ...' was restricted by section 2169 in common with the other provisions of the title. The words 'this title' were used for the purpose of identifying that provision (and others), but it was the provision which was restricted. That provision having been amended and carried into the act of 1906, section 2169 being left intact and unrepealed, it will require some thing \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 194]\n\u00a0\n more persuasive than a narrowly literal reading of the identifying words 'this title' to justify the conclusion that Congress intended the restriction to be no longer applicable to the provision.\n It is the duty of this Court to give effect to the intent of Congress. Primarily this intent is ascertained by giving the words their natural significance, but if this leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, we must examine the matter further. We may then look to the reason of the enactment and inquire into its antecedent history and give it effect in accordance with its design and purpose, sacrificing, if necessary, the literal meaning in order that the purpose may not fail. See Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 511; Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold, etc., Co., \n93 U.S. 634\n, 638. We are asked to conclude that Congress, without the consideration or recommendation of any committee, without a suggestion as to the effect, or a word of debate as to the desirability, of so fundamental a change, nevertheless, by failing to alter the identifying words of section 2169, which section we may assume was continued for some serious purpose, has radically modified a statute always theretofore maintained and considered as of great importance. It is inconceivable that a rule in force from the beginning of the government, a part of our history as well as our law, welded into the structure of our national polity by a century of legislative and administrative acts and judicial decisions, would have been deprived of its force in such dubious and casual fashion. We are, therefore, constrained to hold that the act of 1906 is limited by the provisions of section 2169 of the Revised Statutes.\n Second. This brings us to inquire whether, under section 2169, the appellant is eligible to naturalization. The language of the naturalization laws from 1790 to 1870 had been uniformly such as to deny the privilege of \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 195]\n\u00a0\n naturalization to an alien unless he came within the description 'free white person.' By section 7 of the act of July 14, 1870 (16 Stat. 254, 256 [ Comp. St.  4358]), the naturalization laws were 'extended to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.' Section 2169 of the Revised Statutes, as already pointed out, restricts the privilege to the same classes of persons, viz. 'to aliens [being free white persons, and to aliens] of African nativity and to persons of African descent.' It is true that in the first edition of the Revised Statutes of 1873 the words in brackets, 'being free white persons, and to aliens' were omitted, but this was clearly an error of the compilers and was corrected by the subsequent legislation of 1875 (18 Stat. 316, 318). Is appellant, therefore, a 'free white person,' within the meaning of that phrase as found in the statute?\n On behalf of the appellant it is urged that we should give to this phrase the meaning which it had in the minds of its original framers in 1790 and that it was employed by them for the sole purpose of excluding the black or African race and the Indians then inhabiting this country. It may be true that those two races were alone thought of as being excluded, but to say that they were the only ones within the intent of the statute would be to ignore the affirmative form of the legislation. The provision is not that Negroes and Indians shall be excluded, but it is, in effect, that only free white persons shall be included. The intention was to confer the privilege of citizenship upon that class of persons whom the fathers knew as white, and to deny it to all who could not be so classified. It is not enough to say that the framers did not have in mind the brown or yellow races of Asia. It is necessary to go farther and be able to say that had these particular races been suggested the language of the act would have been so varied as to include them within its privileges. As said by Chief Justice Marshall in Dartmouth College \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 196]\n\u00a0\n v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 644 (4 L. Ed. 629), in deciding a question of constitutional construction:\n'It is not enough to say that this particular case was not in the mind of the convention, when the article was framed, nor of the American people, when it was adopted. It is necessary to go farther, and to say that, had this particular case been suggested, the language would have been so varied, as to exclude it, or it would have been made a special exception. The case, being within the words of the rule, must be within its operation likewise, unless there be something in the literal construction so obviously absurd, or mischievous, or repugnant to the general spirit of the instrument, as to justify those who expound the Constitution in making it an exception.'\n\n If it be assumed that the opinion of the framers was that the only persons who would fall outside the designation 'white' were Negroes and Indians, this would go no farther than to demonstrate their lack of sufficient information to enable them to foresee precisely who would be excluded by that term in the subsequent administration of the statute. It is not important in construing their words to consider the extent of their ethnological knowledge or whether they thought that under the statute the only persons who would be denied naturalization would be Negroes and Indians. It is sufficient to ascertain whom they intended to include and having ascertained that it follows, as a necessary corollary, that all others are to be excluded,\n The question then is: Who are comprehended within the phrase 'free white persons'? Undoubtedly the word 'free' was originally used in recognition of the fact that slavery then existed and that some white persons occupied that status. The word, however, has long since ceased to have any practical significance and may now be disregarded.\n We have been furnished with elaborate briefs in which the meaning of the words 'white person' is discussed \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 197]\n\u00a0\n with ability and at length, both from the standpoint of judicial decision and from that of the science of ethnology. It does not seem to us necessary, however, to follow counsel in their extensive researches in these fields. It is sufficient to note the fact that these decisions are, in substance, to the effect that the words import a racial and not an individual test, and with this conclusion, fortified as it is by reason and authority, we entirely agree. Manifestly the test afforded by the mere color of the skin of each individual is impracticable, as that differs greatly among persons of the same race, even among Anglo-Saxons, ranging by imperceptible gradations from the fair blond to the swarthy brunette, the latter being darker than many of the lighter hued persons of the brown or yellow races. Hence to adopt the color test alone would result in a confused overlapping of races and a gradual merging of one into the other, without any practical line of separation. Beginning with the decision of Circuit Judge Sawyer, in Re Ah Yup, 5 Sawy. 155, Fed. Cas. No. 104 (1878), the federal and state courts, in an almost unbroken line, have held that the words 'white person' were meant to indicate only a person of what is popularly known as the Caucasian race. Among these decisions, see, for example: In re Camille (C. C.) 6 Fed. 256; In re Saito (C. C.) 62 Fed. 126; In re Nian, 6 Utah, 259, 21 Pac. 993, 4 L. R. A. 726; In re Kumagai (D. C.) 163 Fed. 922; In re Yamashita, 30 Wash. 234, 237, 70 Pac. 482, 94 Am. St. Rep. 860; In re Ellis (D. C.) 179 Fed. 1002; In re Mozumdar (D. C.) 207 Fed. 115, 117; In re Singh (D. C.) 257 Fed. 209, 211, 212; and In re Charr ( D. C.) 273 Fed. 207. With the conclusion reached in these several decisions we see no reason to differ. Moreover, that conclusion has become so well established by judicial and executive concurrence and legislative acquiescence that we should not at this late day feel at liberty to disturb it, in the absence of reasons far more cogent than any that have been suggested. United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 472\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 309. \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 198]\n\u00a0\n The determination that the words 'white person' are synonymous with the words 'a person of the Caucasian race' simplifies the problem, although it does not entirely dispose of it. Controversies have arisen and will no doubt arise again in respect of the proper classification of individuals in border line cases. The effect of the conclusion that the words 'white person' means a Caucasian is not to establish a sharp line of demarcation between those who are entitled and those who are not entitled to naturalization, but rather a zone of more or less debatable ground outside of which, upon the one hand, are those clearly eligible, and outside of which, upon the other hand, are those clearly ineligible for citizenship. Individual cases falling within this zone must be determined as they arise from time to time by what this court has called, in another connection (Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 104), 'the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.'\n The appellant, in the case now under consideration, however, is clearly of a race which is not Caucasian and therefore belongs entirely outside the zone on the negative side. A large number of the federal and state courts have so decided and we find no reported case definitely to the contrary. These decisions are sustained by numerous scientific authorities, which we do not deem it necessary to review. We think these decisions are right and so hold.\n The briefs filed on behalf of appellant refer in complimentary terms to the culture and enlightenment of the Japanese people, and with this estimate we have no reason to disagree; but these are matters which cannot enter into our consideration of the questions here at issue. We have no function in the matter other than to ascertain the will of Congress and declare it. Of course there is not implied-either in the legislation or in our interpretation of it-any suggestion of individual unworthiness or racial inferiority. These considerations are in no manner involved. \n\n[260 U.S. 178, 199]\n\u00a0\n The questions submitted are therefore answered as follows:\n Question No. 1. The act of June 29, 1906, is not complete in itself, but is limited by section 2169 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\n Question No. 2. No.\n Question No. 3.

St.  4358) is conceded to have been in full force and effect.\n The respondent, as Secretary of State of the state of Washington, refused to receive and file articles of incorporation of the Japanese Real Estate Holding Company, executed by petitioners, upon the ground that, being of the Japanese race, they were not at the time of their naturalization and never had been entitled to naturalization under the laws of the United States and were therefore not qualified under the laws of the state of Washington to form the corporation proposed, or to file articles naming them as sole trustees of said corporation. Thereupon petitioners applied to the Supreme Court of the state for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to receive and file the articles of incorporation, but that court refused and petitioners bring the case here by writ of certiorari.\n Upon the authority of Takao Ozawa v. United States, supra, we must hold that the petitioners were not eligible to naturalization, and as this ineligibility appeared upon the face of the judgment of the superior court, admitting petitioners to citizenship, that court was without juris diction \n\n[260 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n and its judgment was void.

St.  1215) in a case in which the law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.\n The Burke Construction Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Missouri, filed its bill against Terral, Secretary of State of Arkansas, averring that it has been licensed to do business in the state of Arkansas under an act of the Arkansas Legislature approved May 13, 1907 (Laws 1907, p. 744); that it was organized for the purpose of doing construction work, and carrying on interstate commerce, and was actually so engaged in Arkansas; that the right to do business in the state was a valuable privilege, and the revocation of the license would greatly injure it; that it had brought an original suit in the federal court of Arkansas and had removed a suit brought against it to the same federal court; that the Secretary of State was about to revoke the license because of such suit and such removal, acting under the requirement of section 1 of the act of the Legislature of Arkansas of May 13, 1907, reading as follows: \n\n[257 U.S. 529, 531]\n\u00a0\n 'If any company shall, without the consent of the other party to any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court of this state, remove said suit or proceeding to any federal court, or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of this state in any federal court, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to forthwith revoke all authority to such company and its agents to do business in this state, and to publish such revocation in some newspaper of general circulation published in this state; and if such corporation shall thereafter continue to do business in this state, it shall be subject to the penalty of this act for each day it shall continue to do business in this state after such revocation.'\n The penalty fixed is not less than $1,000 a The Construction Company avers that this act is in contravention of section 2, article 3, i. e., the judiciary article of the federal Constitution, and of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The defendant filed an answer in which there were many denials. One was that the complainant was engaged in interstate commerce. The answer did not deny, however, that the complainant was a foreign corporation, that it had been duly granted a license to do business in the state of Arkansas, that its right to do business in the state thus licensed was a valuable right, that the complainant had brought suit in the federal District Court and removed another case to that court, that such suit and removal were violations of the license granted by the state of Arkansas, or that the defendant intended to cancel the plaintiff's license. The case was heard on bill and answer, and is to be considered on the averments of the bill which are not denied by the answer. Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 239.\n The sole question presented on the record is whether a state law is unconstitutional which revokes a license to a foreign corporation to do business within the state because, \n\n[257 U.S. 529, 532]\n\u00a0\n while doing only a domestic business in the state, it resorts to the federal court sitting in the state.\n The cases in this court in which the conflict between the power of a state to exclude a foreign corporation from doing business within its borders, and the federal constitutional right of such foreign corporation to resort to the federal courts has been considered, cannot be reconciled. They began with Home Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, which was followed by Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co., \n94 U.S. 535\n; Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 186\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 931; Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 202\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 44; Martin v. Baltimore, \n151 \nU.S. 673, 684\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 533; Barrow Steamship Co. v.

Philadelphia & Reading Coal Co., \n241 U.S. 329\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 563\n\n\n The principle established by the more recent decisions of this court is that a state may not, in imposing conditions upon the privilege of a foreign corporation's doing business in the state, exact from it a waiver of the exercise of its constitutional right to resort to the federal courts, or thereafter withdraw the privilege of doing business because of its exercise of such right, whether waived in advance or not. The principle does not depend for its application on the character of the business the corporation does, whether state or interstate, although that has been suggested as a distinction in some cases. It rests on the ground that the federal Constitution confers upon citizens of one state the right to resort to federal courts in another, that state action, whether legislative or executive, necessarily calculated to curtail the free exercise of the right thus secured is void because the soverign power of a state in excluding foreign corporations, as in the exercise of all others of its sovereign powers, is subject to the \n\n[257 U.S. 529, 533]\n\u00a0\n limitations of the supreme fundamental law. It follows that the cases of Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., \n94 U.S. 535\n, and Security Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 U.S. 246\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 619, must be considered as overruled and that the views of the minority judges in those cases have become the law of this court. The appellant in proposing to comply with the statute in question and revoke the license was about to violate the constitutional right of the appellee. In enjoining him the District Court was right, and its decree is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERRITORY OF ALASKA v. TROY(1922)\nNo. 392\nArgued: Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Rustgard, of Juneau, Alaska, for appellants.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 101, 109]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the court below appellants' bill was dismissed upon demurrer. It attacks the validity of section 27, Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988,1 upon the ground that the regulation of commerce prescribed therein gives a preference to ports of the Pacific Coast states over those of Alaska, contrary to section 9, art. 1, of the federal Constitution:\n'No preference shall be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one State over those of another.'\n\n The act purports among other things 'to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine,' and section 27 forbids transportation of merchandise \n\n[258 U.S. 101, 110]\n\u00a0\n over any portion of the route between points in the United States including Alaska 'in any other vessel than a vessel built in and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by persons who are citizens of the United States, or vessels to which the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade is extended by sections 18 or 22 of this act,' provided that under certain conditions this limitation shall not apply to merchandise transported between points within the United States, excluding Alaska, over through routes by Canadian rail lines and connecting water facilities.\n The bill assumes that the preference is obvious upon a consideration of the statute without more. And although by fostering lines of boats which afford frequent, regular and speedy service, and otherwise, the practical effect may be highly beneficial to Alaskan ports, nevertheless, in view of the record, we will assume that the act does give preference to ports of the states over those of the territory.\n Alaska has been incorporated into and is part of the United States, and the Constitution, so far as applicable, is controlling upon Congress when legislating in respect thereto. Rasmussen v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 516, 525\n, 528 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 514. It has been organized and is governed under appropriate congressional action. For present purposes, therefore, we need not inquire into the object and scope of the treaty of cession.\n The questioned regulation relates directly to commerce and clearly is not within the usual meaning of the words of section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution:\n'All duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.'\n\n That such regulations are not controlled by the uniformity clause was pointed out in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia, 12 How. 299, 314 (13 L. Ed. 996):\n'But, having previously stated that, in this instance, the law complained of does not pass the appropriate line \n\n[258 U.S. 101, 111]\n\u00a0\n which limits laws for the regulation of pilots and pilotage, the suggestion, that this law levies a duty on tonnage or on imports or exports, is not admissible; and, if so, it also follows, that this law is not repugnant to the first clause of the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution, which declares that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; for, if it is not to be deemed a law levying a duty, impost, or excise, the want of uniformity throughout the United States is not objectionable.'\n\n The appellants insist that 'state' in the preference clause includes an incorporated and organized territory. This word appears very often in the Constitution and as generally used therein it clearly excludes a 'territory.' To justify the broad meaning now suggested would require considerations more cogent than any which have been suggested. Obviously, the best interests of a detached territory may often demand that its ports be treated very differently from those within the states. And we can find nothing in the Constitution itself or its history which compels the conclusion that it was intended to deprive Congress of power so to act. See Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & B. Bridge Co., 18 How. 421; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 107\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747.\n Great weight is attributed to certain statements concerning the preference clause found in the several opinions announced in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 249\n, 288 S., 352, 354, 355, 21 Sup. Ct. 770. But none of these opinions was accepted by a majority of the court and statements therein are not binding upon us. That controversy grew out of a revenue measure and the point now presented was not directly involved. The writers used the language relied upon in arguments intended to support their particular views concerning the fundamental points. Without attempting to ascertain the exact purport of these expressions it suffices to say that they afford no adequate support for appellants' position. \n\n[258 U.S. 101, 112]\n\u00a0\n A quotation from the opinion of the court in Rasmussen v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 516, 520\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 514, 515 (49 L. Ed. 862), is apposite:\n'In Dorr v. United States, \n195 U.S. 138\n, the question was whether the Sixth Amendment was controlling upon Congress in legislating for the Philippine Islands. Applying the principles which caused a majority of the judges who concurred in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, to think that the uniformity clause of the Constitution was inapplicable to Porto Rico, and following the ruling announced in Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, it was decided that, whilst by the treaty with Spain the Philippine Islands had come under the sovereignty of the United States and were subject to its control as a dependency or possession, those Islands had not been incorporated into the United States as a part thereof, and therefore Congress, in legislating concerning them, was subject only to the provisions of the Constitution applicable to territory occupying that relation.'\n\n The judgment below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 5, 1920-To provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine, to repeal certain emergency legislation, and provide for the disposition, regulation, and use of property acquired thereunder and for other purposes.\n Sec. 27.

They provide for official state inspection of petroleum and petroleum products; prescribe tests relating to their fitness for use-a flash test for illuminating oils, a specific gravity test for gasoline-and establish inspection fees dependent upon the quantity inspected, but at a higher rate per gallon in small quantities than in large; the fees being fixed, however, upon a basis that has been found in practice to yield revenues substantially in excess of the costs of inspection. The officials in charge of enforcement of the system, here made defendants, are the commissioner of agriculture, a general inspector of oils, and numerous local inspectors, whose duties are set forth in the cited Code sections and in the Act of 1912. Among other provisions for rendering the acts effective, section 639 of the Penal Code makes it a misdemeanor to sell or offer for sale illuminating fluids in violation of the pertinent provisions of the Civil Code, and section 642, to sell or keep for sale, or in storage, crude or refined petroleum, naphtha, kerosene, etc., without having the same inspected and approved by an authorized inspector. \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n The federal jurisdiction was invoked both because of diverse citizenship and because the suit arose under the Constitution of the United States. Upon the merits, questions of state law were and are raised, as they may be (Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88), in addition to federal crestions.\n Enforcement of the inspection fees was and is resisted upon the ground that they constitute an arbitrary and unreasonable exaction, not sustainable as a fair exercise of the taxing power, but invalid as violative of the guaranty of due process of law contained in the state Constitution, as well as that in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n A more specific objection is that the imposition of the fees is in conflict with article 7,  2, par. 1, of the state Constitution, which provides:\n'All taxation shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.'\n\n But the contention most emphasized is rested upon the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, the insistence being that inspection fees exceeding the cost of inspection, as imposed upon plaintiff's products, constitute a burden upon interstate commerce. As to this, defendants denied that the laws in question by proper construction applied, or as enforced by the state officers were made to apply, to plaintiff's products while in interstate commerce; they averred that inspections were not required to be made, nor fees to be paid, until after the products had arrived at destination in the state and were held in storage by the consignee for the purposes of sale in the state.\n Upon amended bill and answer, and affidavits pro and con, an application for interlocutory injunction was heard before three judges pursuant to section 266, Judicial Code, as amended March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013, c. 160 (Comp. St.  1243), and resulted \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n in a decision June 28, 1920 (one judge dissenting), pursuant to which an injunction pendente lite was granted restraining the collection of inspection fees in respect to kerosene oil, gasoline, or other petroleum products of plaintiff brought into the state of Georgia from other states and intended to be sold in the original packages, and so sold; but injunction was refused, and restraining orders theretofore granted were dissolved, as to products brought in for indefinite storage within the state, or for sale after breaking the original package, after completion of the interstate transportation. 266 Fed. 577. An appeal was taken by plaintiff direct to this court, as authorized by section 266, Judicial Code.\n The controlling facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff carries on in Georgia and extensive business in the distribution and sale of illuminating oil and gasoline. Neither commodity is produced in Georgia, and all plaintiff's supplies for that are brought from points in other states, principally by rail in tank cars owned by plaintiff, having a capacity of approximately 8,000 gallons each. Plaintiff has 34 local agencies or distributing stations at different points in the state, at which are stationary storage tanks for oil and gasoline respectively, pumps and other apparatus for transferring the products from tank car to storage tank, and either a railroad siding, or (in a few cases) a private track in proximity to the storage tanks. Plaintiff also maintains wagons for the delivery of oil and gasoline from the stationary tanks to its customers. The principal part of its products comes to the distributing stations consigned to plaintiff or its manager or agent. As a rule, and as a part of plaintiff's own system, as soon as one of the tank cars is started from the point of origin outside the state a request for inspection, together with a check for the inspection fees, is forwarded by plaintiff to the local inspector nearest the point of destination, notifying him that the shipment is en route, and re questing \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n him to give it immediate attention upon arrival. Upon its arrival the local agent notifies the inspector, who thereupon, in compliance with the previous request, inspects the oil or gasoline by taking a sample from the tank car, after which its contents are conveyed to and into the storage tank, and then distributed and sold to patrons, either directly from the tank or by means of the delivery wagons. In some instances, involving substantial quantities but only a small proportion of the whole-less than 5 per cent.-plaintiff sells tank cars of gasoline and kerosene direct to its customers in Georgia, making interstate shipment direct to customer's address.\n The majority of the judges held that the provisions for inspection of petroleum products were a permissible exercise of the state's police power; that in so far as the fees yielded revenue in excess of the cost of inspection they were attributable to the taxing power of the state and not objectionable except as applied to interstate commerce, as to which they were invalid; that they were not in conflict with the uniformity clause of the state Constitution; that so far as plaintiff's products were indefinitely stored within the state, or sold there after breaking bulk or original packages, they were subject, not only to inspection, but to the tax imposed, as soon as the interstate transportation was ended; and that the state should be permitted to enforce the inspection fees so soon as the products passed out of interstate commerce, although restrained with respect to products while in such commerce, citing Ratterman v. Western Union Tel. Co., \n127 U.S. 411\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1127.\n After the interlocutory decree and pending the appeal, evidently in view of the controversy raised in this case, the General Assembly passed an act, approved August 17, 1920 (Ga. Laws 1920, No. 800, p. 163), declaring that the laws relating to inspection and tests, and prescribing the fees therefor and the duties of the Commissioner of Agriculture \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n and general oil inspector and local inspectors, as set forth in sections 1800 to 1814, both inclusive, of the Civil Code, and in Act of August 19, 1912, and the penalties provided in sections 639 and 642 of the Penal Code, 'shall never be held or construed to apply to oils and gasoline, benzine, or naphtha, or other articles mentioned in said laws, imported into this state in interstate commerce and intended to be sold in the original and unbroken tank cars or other original receptacles or packages, and so sold, while the same are in interstate commerce.' Sec. 1.\n In view of the provisions of this act we need spend no time in discussing whether the judges were right in following the rule of practical separability in administration, applied by this court to a taxing law single on its face in Ratterman v. Western Union Tel. Co., \n127 U.S. 411\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1127, a case followed, since the decision below, in Bowman v. Continental Oil Co. (June 6, 1921) \n256 U.S. 642\n, 41 Sup.Ct. 606. Any question whether the same or a different rule ought to be applied to an inspection law employed for the purpose of revenue taxation, based upon doubt as to the intent of the state Legislature to permit the system to remain in force with respect to products stored within the state or sold in domestic commerce, when determined to be unenforceable as to the like goods while in interstate commerce, is set at rest by the new act, which under the circumstances must be accepted as manifesting an intent that the system shall remain in effect as to products that are subject to the taxing power of the state, as clearly as it declares a contrary purpose as to products still remaining in interstate commerce. Although passed after the decree below, this act must be given effect in deciding the appeal, since the case involves only relief by injunction, and this operates wholly in futuro. Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 464\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196.\n That a state is within its governmental powers in requiring inspection, including tests as to quality, as a \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n safeguard with respect to inflammable substances such as those here involved, when found within its borders, or even when moving in commerce from state to state (there being no legislation by Congress upon the subject), is well settled. Pure Oil Co. v. Minnesota, \n248 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 35. That with respect to such substances when they have passed out of interstate commerce and have come to rest within the state and become a part of the general mass of property or have become the subject of domestic commerce, the state may impose inspection fees substantially in excess of the cost of inspection, and thus make them a source of general revenue, is also free from doubt, other than any which may arise from its own Constitution. But a state may not, without consent of Congress, impose this or any other kind of taxation directly upon interstate commerce; and inspection fees made to apply to such commerce, exceeding so clearly and obviously the cost of inspection as to amount in effect to a revenue tariff, are to the extent of the excess a burden upon the commerce amounting to a regulation of it, and hence invalid because inconsistent with the exclusive authority of Congress over that subject. Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, 394-395, 39 Sup. Ct. 320.\n Plaintiff makes the broad contention that inspection charges amounting in effect to taxation cannot be imposed even upon that part of its product which has come to rest within the state, or is disposed of in domestic trade, in view of the fact that all of it has come from other states. But American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500, 520\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 365, settles the principle that goods brought into a state, not from a foreign country but from another state, having reached their destination and being held in storage awaiting sale and distribution, enjoying the protection which the laws of the state afford, may without violation of the commerce clause be subjected to nondiscriminatory state taxation, even though still contained \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 476]\n\u00a0\n in original packages. This decision is in line with the previous cases of Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 140, and Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 632-634, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091; and it was pointed out that their authority was not overruled by Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 U.S. 100\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 681, or other cases of like character.\n Appellant insists that Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 320, is inconsistent with the imposition of inspection fees on a revenue basis upon goods brought from another state, however held or disposed of in Georgia. That decision, however, extended the exemption from such fees of goods brought from state to state, no further than 'while the same are in the original receptacles or containers in which they are brought into the state' (\n249 \nU.S. 394, 395\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 321); and so it was interpreted in Askren v. Continental Oil Co., \n252 \nU.S. 444, 449\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 355.\n Brown v. Houston and American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, supra, sustain the power of a state to impose property taxes upon goods brought from another state, after they have come to rest in the taxing state. But this carries equally the power to tax, without discrimination, domestic sales made of personal property similarly freed from interstate commerce, as is illustrated in Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 140; Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 103 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 93, and cases there cited. The fact that no goods of the like kind are produced within the taxing state, and that necessarily all have come from other states, is not of itself sufficient to show a discrimination against interstate commerce. The precise point was dealt with in Askren v. Continental Oil Co., supra, in that part of the opinion which treated of the excise tax imposed by New Mexico upon retail sales of gasoline, respecting which the court said (252 U. S.449, 450, 40 Sup. Ct. 356):\n'A business of this sort, although the gasoline was brought into the state in interstate commerce, is properly taxable by the laws of the state. Much is made of the fact that New Mexico \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 477]\n\u00a0\n does not produce gasoline, and all of it that is dealt in within that state must be brought in from other states. But, so long as there is no discrimination against the products of another state, and none is shown from the mere fact that the gasoline is produced in another state, the gasoline thus stored and dealt in, is not beyond the taxing power of the state.'\n\n The ruling was reiterated in the same case at its final state, Bowman v. Continental Oil Co. (decided June 6, 1921)\n256 U.S. 642\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 606\n\n\n Something should be said as to the inspection of plaintiff's products, involving liability for fees, while the products yet remain in the tank cars. A like question raised in Pure Oil Co. v. Minnesota, \n248 \nU.S. 158, 164\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 35, concerning the oil inspection law of that state, was unnecessary then to be decided; the court having found the inspection fees there imposed were not shown to be so largely in excess of the cost of inspection as to amount to a tax inadmissible as applied to subjects still in interstate commerce, and hence that they might be imposed while the products remained in such commerce. In this case, the fees concededly being a source of revenue, the question of so adjusting their application as to avoid taxing interstate commerce becomes important.\n The practice, uniformly followed with plaintiff's consent, indeed at its request and for its convenience, has been to inspect the oil and gasoline arriving at its distributing stations while remaining in the tank cars, with resulting immediate liability for the fees; otherwise as to direct deliveries to its customers buying in tank car lots. In the normal course of the business, as shown by this record, the tank cars are not only the vehicles but the original containers for interstate terstate transportation, as well with respect to products consigned to plaintiff's own stations as to deliveries made direct to other interstate consignees. Ordinarily, unless a loaded car be used for indefinite storage, or as a distributing tank for local sales \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 478]\n\u00a0\n (nothing of either kind appears in the case) it remains in interstate commerce until unloaded, and the agents of the state may not lawfully subject its contents to the inspection charges until transferred to the storage tank, unless with plaintiff's consent. Neither under a fair construction of the act of 1920, nor (if that permitted) under the Constitution of the United States, may such inspection combined with taxation be imposed as a condition of admitting into the domestic market goods arriving at destination in interstate commerce. The mere fact that a loaded tank car has been halted upon a siding, or even upon a private track, for the purpose of unloading, at a station either of plaintiff or of any other interstate consignee, does not, under the course of business here shown, amount to a 'coming to rest within the state,' authorizing state taxation. And although the state may tax the first domestic sale of the products, or tax them upon their storage in stationary tank awaiting sale, it may not, without consent of the owner, impose its power upon the products while yet in the tank car, but must resort to other means of collection, if need be.\n The evidence strongly tends to show that it may be more convenient to plaintiff that inspection before unloading of tank cars, as heretofore practiced, be continued; and there is no legal objection to this, if done with plaintiff's free consent. Aside from this, the authority of defendants to tax the products or their storage or sale commences when they have come to rest; ordinarily when transferred from the tank car to the storage tank and added to plaintiff's stock in trade kept therein for local distribution and sale.\n We interpret the decree below as permitting no interference by defendants with the right of plaintiff freely to carry on its interstate commerce under the Constitution of the United States, as that right is here stated. \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 479]\n\u00a0\n That matter being out of the way, plaintiff's objections to the inspection and taxing system as arbitrary and unreasonable, and not a fair exercise of the taxing power, though magnified by confused manner of statement, are easily disposed of. Considering not merely the terms, but the practical operation and effect of the statutory provisions, which is the proper method (St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99), we have here a combined inspection and revenue law applicable to petroleum products, not materially differing in main features (aside from the revenue derived from the fees) from those adopted by other states, and doubtless chosen for facility and economy in operation and equitable apportionment of the burdens according to the benefits. It has a twofold object: first, that these inflammable substances be not stored or distributed among the people of Georgia without such assurance of quality and fitness as the prescribed inspection and tests may afford; secondly, that charges sufficient to defray the cost, with something additional for the general treasury, be imposed in a way to operate as an indirect tax upon the ultimate consumers of the products, approximately in proportion to the amounts consumed. That it combines regulation with revenue raising is not a valid objection from the standpoint of the Fourteenth Amendment. Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 189\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 633. The tax to describe it according to its essential nature, is an excise upon domestice sale or storage, designed to affect the use of the products, a tax imposed at the time of inspection, the inspector acting also as tax gatherer, inspection and tax payment required but once, and that, ordinarily, from the dealer at the time of the first domestic sale, or during storage preliminary to such sale. The self-interest of the dealer and the customs of trade are relied upon to add the tax to the price of the product, and thus pass it on to the \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 480]\n\u00a0\n ultimate consumer-a method appropriate in indirect taxation, and certainly a not unreasonable mode of distributing the burden among those who share in the benefits.\n That the Legislature intended the effect of the tax to fall upon the ultimate consumer is evident, not only from the obviously inevitable result of requiring its payment, ordinarily, by the first domestic seller, but from the specific provisions of the amendatory act of 1913, that the 1912 act--\n'shall apply not only to gasolines, benzines and naphthas sold or offered for sale in the state of Georgia, but likewise to all such commodities that may be sold elsewhere and brought into the state of Georgia, for consumption or use. Where such commodities or any of them may be purchased within the state, or without the state, and brought into the state, by any person, firm or corporation, not for the purpose of selling or offering the same for sale, but for the purpose of use or consumption by the purchaser in manufacturing or other lawful uses, either as fuel or otherwise, the inspections herein prescribed shall be made, and the fees above fixed shall be paid therefor, except that no such purchaser shall be required to pay more than twelve hundred dollars per year for the inspection of all such commodities used or consumed by him as aforesaid, and such payments may, in the discretion of the Commissioner of Agriculture, be divided into equal monthly payments of one hundred dollars each.'\n\n No case is shown for the application of this act; the judges below found no occasion to pass upon it, plaintiff's products not being brought in for its own consumption. In this court there has been no discussion as to its proper construction, plaintiff's counsel insisting merely that it shows the inspection fees are not imposed as a privilege tax for the conduct of any particular kind of business. \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 481]\n\u00a0\n Apparently, it was intended to cover the case of large consumers who otherwise might find it advantageous to bring in, and store until needed, quantities of oil or gasoline sufficient for their own consumption, thus escaping dealer's profit and inspection tax as well. We find in its provisions nothing to raise a question about the validity of the system.\n We are unable to see in article 7, section 2, paragraph 1, of the state Constitution anything to prevent the application of these statutes to plaintiff's business. The requirement of uniform valuation upon all property subject to be taxed manifestly refers to property taxes imposed by reason of ownership, which this is not. The clauses requiring that all taxation shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and levied and collected under general laws, are not violated by the tax in question. Classification is in terms permitted, and a law based on reasonable classification must be deemed a general law, in the sense of the Constitution.\n The decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia hold that, while property taxes must be strictly on an ad valorem basis-without variance even as between real and personal property (Verdery v. Village of Summerville, 82 Ga. 138, 8 S. E. 213; Mayor v. Weed, 84 Ga. 683, 687, 11 S. E. 235, 8 L. R. A. 270)-other subjects of taxation may be resorted to, and the taxes adjusted according to reasonable methods of classification. Atlanta National Ass'n v. Stewart, 109 Ga. 80, 87, 35 S. E. 73. Thus, inheritance taxes, being not a tax upon property but an excise upon the privilege of transfer upon death of an owner, were held valid, although not ad valorem, in Farkas v. Smith, 147 Ga. 503, 512, 94 S. E. 1016.\n The peculiar qualities of illuminating oils and gasoline seem to us a sufficient warrant for putting them in a class by themselves for excise taxation upon their sale or use. So we held, in Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., supra, with respect to an excise upon the sale or use of gasoline, under \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 482]\n\u00a0\n a provision of the Constitution of New Mexico not differing materially.\n While some of the Georgia decisions indicate a rather strict view of the uniformity required (Johnson v. Mayor, etc., of Macon, 62 Ga. 645; Beckett v. Mayor, etc., of Savannah, 118 Ga. 58, 44 S. E. 819), we have found none going so far as it would be necessary to go in order to overthrow the inspection tax now in question. That it is imposed, as a rule, only upon the dealer who makes the first domestic sale, not upon those who may make subsequent sales, is consistent with the nature of the tax and the purpose to distribute its burden among those who ultimately consume the product. To impose a like tax each time the commodity changed hands in retail trade might place so heavy a burden upon those purchasing other than at first hand as to render it impossible for the retailer to compete and thus seriously obstruct general distribution. The graduation of the inspection charges according to the quantity that may be inspected at one time-1\/2 cent per gallon in lots of 400 gallons and upwards, 1 cent in quantities between 200 and 400 gallons, 1 1\/2 cents in quantities less than 200 gallons-speaks for itself, and plainly is sustainable on the ground that the travel, care, and responsibility of the inspector may be greater than uniform fees per gallon would compensate in the case of the smaller lots. The only other diversity we have noticed in the operation of the tax is that which may arise out of the act of 1913 entitling a purchaser who buys not for resale but for his own use or consumption, to a limitation of inspection fees to $1,200 per annum. No point is made of this, but a rather obvious ground of classification suggests itself, in that the purchaser for his own use of consumption has no opportunity to make a profit out of resale, as plaintiff and other dealers who pay the full inspection fees may do. \n\n[258 U.S. 466, 483]\n\u00a0\n Finally, our attention is called to an act, approved August 10, 1921 ( Acts 1921, No. 173, p. 83), providing for an occupation tax upon all distributors selling gasoline and other motor fuels in the state, requiring them to register and make returns, and '(except those importing and selling it in the original packages in which it is brought into the state)' to pay an occupation tax based upon the quantities sold. It is conceded that this does not repeal or affect the inspection laws, and no argument in rested upon it except in support of contentions already disposed of.\n The decree of the District Court must be and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE JACK-O-LANTERN(1922)\nNo. 131\nArgued: January 27, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. George R. Farnum and Lee M. Friedman, both of Boston, Mass., for appellant.\n Mr. George L. Dillaway, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.[ The Jack- O-Lantern \n258 U.S. 96\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[258 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Claiming a lien under Act of Congress approved June 23, 1910 (chapter 373, 36 Stat. 604; Comp. St.  7783-7787),1 and seeking to recover for work done and supplies furnished in pursuance of a contract with the owner of the Jack-O-Lantern, appellant libeled the vessel. The libel was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. If the agreement between the parties is maritime, there was jurisdiction, otherwise there was none.\n The facts are not in dispute. They were stated as follows by the District Court:\n'The Jack-O-Lantern was originally a car float of the usual type, something over 200 feet long, with neither motive power nor steering gear, and having two lines of track on her single deck. The claimant bought her and proceeded to convert her into a steamer to be used for amusement purposes. The tracks were removed, the deck relaid to make a dancing floor, a large house, or superstructure, was built, inclosing most of the deck, and containing a dance hall, rooms, balconies, etc. Steering apparatus and a steam plant of the propeller type, for propulsion, were also installed.\n\n'For the purpose of carrying out these changes the contract now before the court was made between the claimant and the libelant. It covers, generally speaking, all the woodwork involved in the changes above outlined. The \n\n[258 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n libelant did not install the power plant, but it did prepare the vessel for it. The scow was towed to the libelant's yard for the work to be done. The engine and boilers were there installed. As they were not yet in working condition when the vessel left the libelant's yard she was towed away.' 266 Fed. 562.\n\n Upon these facts it held that the contract was not one for repairs or supplies, but for original construction, and therefore nonmaritime within the doctrine of Thames Towboat Co. v. The Francis McDonald, \n254 U.S. 242\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 65 :\n'In rebuilding operations the test is whether the identity of the vessel has continued, or has been extinguished.' 'The matter turns, as I view it, upon a question of fact; and upon the facts stated I think it clear that the identity of the car float which was delivered to the libelant was completely lost by the conversion into an amusement steamer under the contract in suit. It is true that the hull is substantially unchanged; but mere identity of hull is not sufficient to preserve the identity of the vessel.' 'The Jack-O- Lantern, with her dance hall, rooms, and power plant, self-propelled and able to maneuvre, is an essentially different vessel from the car float, which furnished the hull.'\n\n In support of this conclusion McMaster v. One Dredge (D. C.) 95 Fed. 832, and The Dredge A (D. C.) 217 Fed. 617, 629, 630, were cited.\n It is not always easy to determine what constitutes repairs as opposed to original construction. A contract for the former is maritime; if for the latter, it is not. We are not disposed to enlarge the compass of the rule approved in Thames Towboat Co. v. The Francis McDonald, under which contracts for the construction of entirely new ships are classed as nonmaritime, or to apply it to agreements of uncertain intendment- reasonable doubts concerning the latter should be resolved in favor of the admiralty jurisdiction. Nor do we think that in \n\n[258 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n cases like the instant one any refined distinction should be made between reconstruction and repairs-the latter word as used in the statute has a broad meaning.\n As pointed out in Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., \n254 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 1, 4 (65 L. Ed. 97), the Act of June 23, 1910, makes 'no change in the general principles of the [present] law of maritime liens, but merely substitutes a single statute for the conflicting state statutes.'\n This court has not undertaken and will not now essay to announce rigid definitions of repairs and new construction; but we do not accept the suggestion that the two things can be accurately differentiated by consideration of the ultimate use to which the vessel is to be devoted. The view expressed by Judge Hughes in United States v. The Grace Meade, Fed. Cas. No. 15,243, is both sound and helpful:\n'And generally, it may be held as a principle, that, where the keel, stem, and stern posts and ribs of an old vessel, without being broken up and forming an intact frame, are built upon as a skeleton, the case is one of an old vessel rebuilt, and not of a new vessel. Indeed, without regard to the particular parts re-used, if any considerable part of the hull and skeleton of an old vessel in its intact condition, without being broken up, is built upon, the law holds that in such a case it is the old vessel rebuilt, and not a new vessel. But where no piece of the timber of an old vessel is used without being first dislocated and then replaced, where no set of timbers are left together intact in their original positions, but all the timbers are severally taken out, refitted, and then reset, there we have a very different case That is a case of a vessel rebuilt.'\n\n There was jurisdiction in the court below to determine and enforce the rights of the parties. Its judgment to the contrary must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1.

Duarte, who described himself therein as the duly accredited consul general of the republic of Portugal in the United States of America, without more. The petition sets out the proceedings below; declares 'the Portuguese government does not intend to avoid its just obligations to citizens of the United States, but it claims that, if there is any question between it and such citizens, they are matters for adjudication by the diplomatic departments of the two governments, and it does object to the violation of its sovereignty, contrary to all rules of international law and international comity'; and alleges, as one reason for granting the writ, that 'an important question of international law and comity is involved.' There is nothing to show that the consul general had authority or right to take any action concerning the matters in question, except as may be inferred from his official position. Considering the possible international aspect of the controversy, we granted the petition, and appropriate writs issued. Counsel have been heard, both orally and by briefs.\n Nos. 279, 280, and 282 are separate proceedings in rem, commenced in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against the Sao Vicente and the Murmugao, to recover for materials, supplies, work, and labor furnished to them. In each cause, after arrest of the steamer, the Transportes Maritimos do Estado, intervening for its interest, appeared before the court and made claim, averring that it was in possession when the process issued, and was the true and bona fide owner. It asked \n\n[260 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n to defend accordingly, gave bond for costs and value, and secured the vessel's discharge. Thereafter the steamer answered, denying the allegations of the libel, and as a distinct and complete defense alleged that it was owned and operated by the Transportes Maritimos do Estado, a department of the government of Portugal not subject to suits in courts of the United States. This special defense was declared insufficient and final decrees were duly entered. Appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were dismissed (The Carlo Poma, \n255 U.S. 219\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 309), that court being of opinion that the only controverted point was the jurisdiction of the trial court. 281 Fed. 111 and 115.\n Nos. 281 and 283 are separate proceedings in personam, commenced in the same District Court against Transportes Maritimos do Estado, alleged to be a foreign corporation organized under the laws of the republic of Portugal, to recover for services, goods, wares, and merchandise furnished to its steamers, the Cunene and the Santo Antao. The Murmugao was attached. The respondents answered, made general denials, and, as a distinct and complete defense, alleged the Cunene and the Santo Antao were owned and operated bya department of the sovereign and operated by a department of the sovereign court was therefore without jurisdiction. This defense was held insufficient. Appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were dismissed, upon the view that they involved only the question of jurisdiction.\n We are of the opinion that the writs of certiorari were improvidently awarded and must be dismissed. The consul general was not party to any of the proceedings below, and is not competent, merely by virtue of his office, to appear here for his government and claim immunity from process in the manner attempted. In The Anne, 3 Wheat. 435, 445 (4 L. Ed. 428), a prize proceeding for condemnation, a claim was interposed in behalf of the Spanish consul for restitution of the vessel because of asserted violation of the \n\n[260 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n neutral territory of Spain. Speaking through Mr. Justice Story, this court said:\n'And this brings us to the second question in the cause; and that is, whether it was competent for the Spanish counsel, merely by virtue of his office, and without the special authority of his government, to interpose a claim in this case for the assertion of the violated rights of his sovereign. We are of opinion, that his office confers on him no such legal competency. A consul, though a public agent is supposed to be clothed with authority only for commercial purposes. He has an undoubted right to interpose claims for the restitution of property belonging to the subjects of his own country; but he is not considered as a minister, or diplomatic agent of his sovereign, intrusted, by virtue of his office, with authority to represent him in his negotiations with foreign states, or to vindicate his prerogatives. There is no doubt, that his sovereign may specially intrust him with such authority; but in such case his diplomatic character is superadded to his ordinary powers, and ought to be recognized by the government within whose dominions he assumes to exercise it. There is no suggestion, or proof, of any such delegation of special authority in this case; and therefore we consider this claim as asserted by an incompetent person, and on that ground it ought to be dismissed.'\n\n And see United States v.

The questions arising in the three cases are so nearly the same that they can be dealt with together. \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n The Western Maid was and is the property of the United States. On January 10, 1919, she was allocated by the United States Shipping Board to the War Department for service as a transport. She had been loaded with foodstuffs for the relief of the civilian population of Europe, to be delivered on arrival at Falmouth, England, to the order of the Food Administration Grain Corporation, the consignor, American Embassy, London, care of the Chief Quartermaster, American Expeditionary Forces, France; subject to the direction of Mr. Hoover. If it should prove impracticable to reship or redirect to the Territories lately held by the Central Empires, Mr. Hoover was to resell to the Allied Governments or to the Belgian Relief; the foodstuffs to be paid for by the buyer. Ths vessel was manned by a navy crew. Later on the same day, January 10, 1919, in New York harbor, the collision occurred. On March 20, 1919, the vessel was delivered to the United States Shipping Board. The libel was filed on November 8, 1919. Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451,  9, 39 Stat. 728, 730 ( Comp. St.  8146e). The Lake Monroe, \n250 U.S. 246\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 460. On February 20, 1920, the Government moved that it be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The District Court overruled the motion. On April 11, 1921, the Attorney General moved for leave to file the present petition in this Court. Leave was granted and the case has been heard.\n The Liberty was a pilot boat let to the United States on the bare- boat basis at a nominal rate of hire. She had been manned by a crew from the United States Navy and commissioned as a naval dispatch boat, and was employed to serve military needs in war service. The collision took place on December 24, 1917, while she was so employed, in Boston Harbor. Afterwards the vessel was redelivered to the owners and still later, on February 5, 1921, the suit now in question was brought against her. On February 14, under the Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95,  4, 41 Stat. 525, \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n the United States filed a suggestion of its interest, and also set up the above facts. The District Court held that they constituted no defence and this petition was brought by the Attorney General along with that last mentioned.\n The Steamship Carolinian had been chartered to the United States upon a bare-boat charter and had been assigned to the War Department, by which she was employed as an army transport and furnished with an army crew. While she was so employed the collision took place in the harbor of Brest, France, on February 15, 1918. Afterwards the Carolinian was returned to the owners, and she was employed solely as a merchant vessel on July 9, 1920, when the suit in question was begun, under which the vessel was seized. In the same month the United States filed a suggestion of interest, and on January 6, 1921, set up the foregoing facts and prayed that the libel be dismissed. The District Court maintained its jurisdiction and this petition was brought by the Attorney General along with the other two. 270 Fed. 1011\n\n\n It may be assumed that each of these vessels might have been libelled for maritime torts committed after the redelivery that we have mentioned. But the Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451,  9 does not create a liability on the part of the United States, retrospectively, where one did not exist before. Neither in our opinion, is such a liability created by the Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95,  4, authorizing the United States to assume the defence in suits like these. It is not required to abandon any defence that otherwise would be good. It appears to us plain that before the passage of these acts neither the United States nor the vessels in the hands of the United States were liable to be sued for these alleged maritime torts. The Liberty and the Carolinian were employed for public and Government purposes, and were owned pro hac vice by the United States. It is suggested that the Western Maid was a merchant vessel at the time of the \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n collision, but the fact that the food was to be paid for and the other details adverted to in argument cannot disguise the obvious truth, that she was engaged in a public service that was one of the constituents of our activity in the war and its sequel and that had no more to do with ordinary merchandizing than if she had carried a regiment of troops. The only question really open to debate is whether a liability attached to the ships which although dormant while the United States was in possession became enforcible as soon as the vessels came into hands that could be sued.\n In deciding this question we must realize that however ancient may be the traditions of maritime law, however diverse the sources from which it has been drawn, it derives its whole and only power in this country from its having been accepted and adopted by the United States. There is no mystic over-law to which even the United States must bow. When a case is said to be governed by foreign law or by general maritime law that is only a short way of saying that for this purpose the sovereign power takes up a rule suggested from without and makes it part of its own rules. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 571, 572; Dalrymple v. Dalrymple, 2 Hagg. Cons. 54, 58, 59; Dicey, Conflict of Laws (2d Ed.) 6, 7. Also we must realize that the authority that makes the law is itself superior to it, and that if it consents to apply to itself the rules that it applies to others the consent is free and may be withheld. The sovereign does not create justice in an ethical sense, to be sure, and there may be cases in which it would not dare to deny that justice for fear of war or revolution. Sovereignty is a question of power, and no human power is unlimited. Carino v. Insular Government of Philippine Islands, \n212 \nU.S. 449, 458\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 334. But from the necessary point of view of the sovereign and its organs whatever is enforced by it as law is enforced as the \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n expression of its will. Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 \nU.S. 349, 353\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 526.\n The United States has not consented to be sued for torts, and therefore it cannot be said that in a legal sense the United States has been guilty of a tort. For a tort is a tort in a legal sense only because the law has made it so. If then we imagine the sovereign power announcing the system of its laws in a single voice it is hard to conceive it as declaring that while it does not recognize the possibility of its acts being a legal wrong and while its immunity from such an imputation of course extends to its property, at least when employed in carrying on the operations of the Government-specifically appropriated to national objects in the language of Buchanan v. Alexander, 4 How. 20-yet if that property passes into other hands, perhaps of an innocent purchaser, it may be seized upon a claim that had no existence before. It may be said that the persons who actually did the act complained of may or might be sued and that the ship for this purpose is regarded as a person. But that is a fiction not a fact and as a fiction is the creation of the law. It would be a strange thing if the law created a fiction to accomplish the result supposed. It is totally immaterial that in dealing with private wrongs the fiction, however originated, is in force. See Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate Steam Navigation Co. v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, \n251 \nU.S. 48, 53\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 66. The personality of a public vessel is merged in that of the sovereign. The Fidelity, 16 Blatchford, 569, 573, Fed. Cas. No. 4,758; In re State of New York-The Queen City, \n256 U.S. 503\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 592, June 1, 1921.\n But it is said that the decisions have recognized that an obligation is created in 573, Fed. Cas. No. 4,758, and In re State of exist but cannot be enforced are ghosts that are seen in the law but that are elusive to the grasp. The leading authority relied upon is The Siren, 7 Wall. 152. \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 434]\n\u00a0\n The ground of that decision was that when the United States came into court to enforce a claim it would be assumed to submit to just claims of third persons in respect of the same subject matter. 7 Wall. 154; Carr v. United States, \n98 U.S. 433\n, 438. In reaching its result the Court spoke of such claims as unenforceable liens, but that was little more than a mode of expressing the consent of the sovereign power to see full justice done in such circumstances. It would have been just as effective and more accurate to speak of the claims as ethical only, but recognized in the interest of justice when the sovereign came into court. They were treated in this way by Dr. Lushington in The Athol, 1 Wm. Rob. 374, 382. Further distinctions have been taken that need not be adverted to here. There was nothing decided in Workman v. New York, \n179 U.S. 552\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 212, that is contrary to our conclusion, which, on the other hand, is favored by The Fidelity, 16 Blatchf. 569, 573, Fed. Cas. No. 4,758, and In re State of New York, Walsh, Petitioner, \n256 U.S. 490\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 588 and In re State of New York, The Queen City, \n256 U.S. 503\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 592, June 1, 1921. The last cited decisions also show that a prohibition may be granted in a case like this. See The Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235.\n Rule absolute for writs of prohibition.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not hear the argument in this case and took no part in the decision.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, dissenting.\n The question in the cases is without complexity, and the means of its solution ready at hand. The question is, What is the law applicable to colliding vessels and what remedy is to be applied to the offending one, if there be an offending one? The question, I venture to say, has unequivocal answer in a number of decisions of this court if they be taken at their word. And why should they \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 435]\n\u00a0\n not be? That they have masqueraded in a double sense, cannot be assumed; that they have successively justified implications adverse to their meaning would be a matter of wonder.\n What, then, do they express to be the law of colliding vessels, the assignment of offence, if offence there be, and how far it is dependent, if at all, upon whether the offender was in public or private service?\n The answer may be immediate. The court has kept steadily in mind that the admiralty jurisprudence of the country, as adopted by the Constitution, has a distinctive individuality, and this court has felt the necessity of keeping its principles in definite integrity, and the remedies intact by which its principles can alone be realized. The most prominent and efficient of its remedies is that which subjects its instrumentalities, its ships particularly, to judgment. Personality is assigned to them and they are considered in pledge to indemnify any damage inflicted through them. They are made offenders and have the responsibility of offenders, and the remedy is suited to the purpose. In Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co., \n237 \nU.S. 303, 306\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 596, 597 (59 L. Ed. 966), it is said, Mr. Justice Hughes delivering the opinion of the court:\n'The proceeding in rem which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty is one essentially against the vessel itself as the debtor or offending thing-in which the vessel is itself 'seized and impleaded as the defendant, and is judged and sentenced accordingly.\"\n\n In the John G. Stevens, \n170 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 544, 547 (42 L. Ed. 969), the court, through Mr. Justice Gray, declared:\n'The foundation of the rule that collision gives to the party injured a jus in re in the offending ship is the principle of the maritime law that the ship, by whomsoever owned or navigated, is considered as herself the wrongdoer, liable for the tort, and subject to a maritime lien for the damages. This principle, as has been observed by careful text-writers on both \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 436]\n\u00a0\n sides of the Atlantic, has been more clearly established, and more fully carried out, in this country than in England. Henry on Admiralty,  75, note; Marsden on Collisions (3d Ed.) 93.'\n\n The case in many ways and by many citations fortifies and illustrates the principle. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Siren was cited, and the fact is pertinent as we shall presently see. The China, 7 Wall. 53, was also cited and quoted from. The quotation was repeated in Ralli v. Troop, \n157 \nU.S. 386, 402\n, 403 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 657, 663 (39 L. Ed. 657) where it is said that the liability of a vessel is not derived from the authority or agency of those on board either under the civil or common law, 'but upon a distinct principle of maritime law, namely, that the vessel, in whomsoever hands she lawfully is, is herself considered as the wrongdoer, liable for the tort, and subject to a marltime lien for the damages.'\n In Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 438\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 195, 201 ( 46 L. Ed. 264), this court, by Mr. Justice Brown, gave graphic representation to the same principle. He described a ship prior to her launching as 'a mere congeries of wood and iron,' but after launching she took on a name, a personality of her own, and had in a sense volition, became competent to contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, could have agents of her own, was capable of committing a tort and was pledged to its reparation. Cases were cited, The Siren among others.\n The doctrine thus explicitly announced is denied application in the pending cases and upon what grounds? As I understand, the contention is that a vessel has not independent guilt; that there must be fault in its owner or \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 437]\n\u00a0\n operator, his fault becoming its fault. This has been said, but it puts out of view her character as bail, and that the innocent victim of the injury she has inflicted shall not be remitted to the insufficient or evasive responsibility of persons, but shall have the security of the tangible and available value of the thing. And this responsibility and fullness of idemnity we have seen it was declared in The John G. Stevens, supra, distinguished the law of this country from that of England.\n But if the contention were conceded it would not determine these cases. I reject absolutely that because the government is exempt from suit that it cannot be accused of fault. Accountability for wrong is one thing, the wrong is another.\n But I do not have to beat about in general reasoning. I may appeal to the authority of The Siren, 7 Wall. 154, and the cases that have approved and followed it. A gloss is attempted to be put upon it- which we think is unjustified and inaccurate unless, indeed, it can be asserted that the writer of the opinion did not know the meaning of the words he used, and, that the members of the court who concurred with him were equally deficient in understanding. And their insensibility to what the words conveyed had no excuse. A dissenting Justice tried to bring their comprehensive import to understanding, proclaimed, indeed, that the words had the extent and consequence that the court now says was not intended nor accomplished.\n The Siren while in charge of a prize master and crew, having been taken in prize by the United States, ran into in the port of New York and sank the sloop Harper. The collision was regarded by the court as the fault the Siren. She was condemned as prize and sold and the proceeds deposited with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States. The owners of the Harper asserted a claim upon her and her proceeds for the damages sustained \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 438]\n\u00a0\n by the collision. The District Court rejected the claim. Its action was reversed by this court.\n The United States was an actor in the case, and this was regarded by the court, who spoke by Mr. Justice Field, as removing the impediment to the claim of the owners of the Harper. It was not, however, the basis of recovery. There was no confusion in the language or conception of the learned Justice, nor in the court, of that. By becoming the actor, the United States, it was said, waived their exemption from direct suit and opened 'to consideration all claims and equities in regard to the property libeled'-not, of course, that the waiver of exemption created the 'claims and equities,' They, it was explicitly said, were created against the offending vessel by the collision. 'In such case,' the language was, 'the claim exists equally as if the vessel belonged to a private citizen, but for reasons of public policy, already stated, cannot be enforced by direct proceedings against the vessel.' And again: 'The inability to enforce the claim against the vessel is not inconsistent with its existence.'\n The distinction was clearly made between exemption of the United States, the offence of the vessel and the existence of a claim against it in consequence of its offence. And the distinction was emphasized in the dissent of Mr. Justice Nelson. He was at pains to distinguish between liability to suit and legal liability for the act of injury, the ground of suit. And the basis of his dissent was the same as the basis of the opinion of the court in the present cases, but not so epigrammatically expressed. In the opinion in these cases it is said that--\n'The United States has not consented to be sued for torts, and therefore it cannot be said that in a legal sense the United States has been guilty of a tort. For a tort is a tort in a legal sense only because the law has made it so.'\n\n Mr. Juctice Nelson was more discursive. He said that--\n'If the owner of the offending vessel [he regarded the Siren as owned by the United States] is not liable at all \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 439]\n\u00a0\n for the collision, it follows, as a necessary legal consequence, that there can be no lien; otherwise, the nonliability would amount to nothing.'\n\n And again:\n'If the government is not responsible, upon the principles of the common law, for wrongs committed by her officers or agents, then, whether the proceedings in the admiralty are against the vessel, or its proceeds, the court is bound to dismiss them.'\n\n And giving point to this view the learned Justice observed that--\n'No principle at common law is better settled than that the government is not liable for the wrongful acts of her public agents.'\n\n I repeat that, in view of these extracts from Mr. Justice Nelson's dissent, misapprehension of its opinion by the court is not conceivable nor carelessness of utterance. Yet the opinion in the present cases practically so asserts and, in effect, regards Mr. Justice Nelson's dissent as the law of The Siren, and not that which the court pronounced. The court decided that the vessel was the offending thing, and though it could not be reached in the hands of the government, this 'inability to enforce the claim against the vessel' was 'not inconsistent with its existence.'\n The inevitable deduction is that in such situation the enforcement of a claim is suspended only and when the vessel passes from the hands of the government, as the offending vessels have in the cases at bar, they and 'all claims and equities in regard to' them may be enforced.\n The case was commented on in The Davis, 10 Wall. 15, 20 (19 L. Ed. 875) and the gloss now put upon it rejected. It is there said that the well supported doctrine of the case is:\n'That proceedings in rem to enforce a lien against property of the United States are only forbidden in cases where, in order to sustain the proceeding, the possession of the United States must be invaded under process of the court.'\n\n So again in Workman v. City of New York, \n179 U.S. 552\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 212, where it is said, Chief Justice White delivering the opinion of the court, after an exhaustive review of cases, such as \n\n[257 U.S. 419, 440]\n\u00a0\n he usually gave:\n'It results that, in the maritime law, the public nature of the service upon which a vessel is engaged at the time of the commission of a maritime tort affords no immunity from liability in a court of admiralty, where the court has jurisdiction.'\n\n In view of this it is difficult to understand how it can be said that there was nothing that case decided contrary to the conclusion in these cases.\n Against this array of cases and their reasoning, In re State of New York, The Queen City, \n256 U.S. 503\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 592, June 1, 1921, and In re State of New York, Walsh, Petitioner, \n256 U.S. 490\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 588, June 1, 1921, are adduced. Neither case has militating force. The latter case decided nothing but that a state cannot be sued without its consent; an indisputable proposition which this court in its opinion had to clear from confusing or disturbing circumstances. In the former case, The Queen City, a steam tug, was in the possession and service of the state of New York and to have awarded process against it as the District Court did, would have arrested the service. This court rightfully reversed that action. The tug had not been released from that immunity as the vessels were in the pending cases.\n Counsel for claimants in opposition to the petition cite cases at Circuit and District which followed the Siren. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[257 U.S. 419, 441]\n\u00a0\n It is not necessary to review or comment upon them. They are testimony of what the judiciary of the country considered and consider The Siren and other cases decided. Therefore we cannot refrain from saying that it is strange that, notwithstanding the language of The Siren, its understanding and acceptance in many cases in this court, the enforcement of its doctrine at circuit and district, it should now be declared erroneous. The cases at bar would seem to be cases for the application of the maxim of stare decisis, which ought to have force enough to resist a change based on finesse of reasoning or attracted by the possible accomplishment of a theoretical correctness.\n The rule should be discharged.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] General Insurance Co. v.

Brown, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is in most respects so like No. 724, United States of America ex rel. John W. French, Plaintiff in Error, v. John W. Weeks, Secretary of War, \n259 U.S. 326\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 505, 66 L. Ed. --, that the two were argued and submitted together.\n The relator herein was a colonel in the army, and was discharged on November 17, 1920, 'by direction of the president,' on order of the Secretary of War, under the provisions of section 24b of the Army Reorganization Act (41 Stat. 759, 773). In his petition he prays, as did Col. French in the other case, for a writ of mandamus commanding the Secretary of War to vacate the order for his discharge and to restore him to the status of colonel in the army, which he had held before the order.\n The defendant answered the petition, a demurrer to the answer was sustained, and, the defendant not desiring to \n\n[259 U.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n plead further, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia granted the writ of mandamus as prayed for. On error the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court, and the case is here for construction of the Act of Congress involved.\n In addition to the contention that section 24b of the Army Reorganization Act required personal and judicial action on the part of the President, this day disposed of in No. 724, only one other question is argued in this case, viz.: Did the failure to give the relator notice of the time and place of the meeting of the Honest and Faithful Board which considered his case, with an opportunity to be heard in his own behalf, so deny to him due process of law as to render void the action resulting in his discharge?\n We shall not repeat the discussion of section 24b which led to our conclusion in No. 724, but we shall here confine ourselves to the additional question, as we have stated it, presented by this record.\n When Col. Creary was notified that he had been placed in class B, as an officer 'who should not be retained in the service,' he requested a Court of Inquiry, which was thereupon convened, and it is averred in the answer and admitted by the demurrer that--\n'by and before that board he was given full and free opportunity to present testimony of himself and others in his behalf and to be heard fully, of which opportunities he availed himself so far as he desired.'\n\n The record of the Court of Inquiry was forwarded, as provided for by section 24b, to the Board of Final Classification, and that board, without notice to the relator, reconsidered his case, but by its final finding retained him in class B. Thereupon, again without notice to relator, his case went to the Honest and Faithful Board, which finally classified him in class B for 'causes due to his neglect, misconduct and avoidable habits,' and under the terms of the statute he was discharged from the army. \n\n[259 U.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n Thus is presented for decision the question whether the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment required that the relator should be given an opportunity to be heard before the finding was made by the board which required his discharge from the army.\n The power given to Congress by the Constitution to raise and equip armies and to make regulations for the government of the land and naval forces of the country (article 1,  8) is as plenary and specific as that given for the organization and conduct of civil affairs; military tribunals are as necessary to secure subordination and discipline in the army as courts are to maintain law and order in civil life; and the experience of our government for now more than a century and a quarter, and of the English government for a century more, proves that a much more expeditious procedure is necessary in military than is thought tolerable in civil affairs (2 Stat. 359; Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65). It is difficult to imagine any process of government more distinctively administrative in its nature and less adapted to be dealt with by the processes of civil courts than the classification and reduction in number of the officers of the army, provided for in section 24b. In its nature it belongs to the executive and not to the judicial branch of the government.\n In the present case it is admitted that the relator was given full opportunity to be heard and that he was heard by the Court of Inquiry, and this is the only one of the four tribunals which dealt with his case which the act of Congress requires shall give him a hearing. The various boards provided for each certainly had jurisdiction over the person of the relator as an army officer and over the subject of inquiry, under the terms of the act of Congress, and also because the right dealt with was distinctly military in its nature, affecting the status in the army of a soldier, and it is entirely clear that the boards which acted on his case did not exceed the powers conferred upon \n\n[259 U.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n them. Such being the case, the Supreme Court of the District was without power to review or in any manner control the conduct of the boards or the result of their action. Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 82; Johnson v. Sayre, \n158 U.S. 109\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 773; Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 380\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 181; Mullan v. United States, \n212 U.S. 516\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 330; Reaves v. Ainsworth, \n219 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 230.\n Without pursuing the subject further, it is sufficient to repeat what was said by this court in Reaves v. Ainsworth, \n219 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 230, 233 (55 L. Ed. 225):\n'To those in the military or naval service of the United States the military law is due process. The decision, therefore, of a military tribunal, acting within the scope of its lawful powers, cannot be reviewed or set aside by the courts.'\n\n It results that, because the action of the President, given effect by the order of the Secretary of War, was in full compliance with the act of Congress, and also because the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction to order the writ of mandamus prayed for, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reversing the judgment of that court, must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL FRENCH v. WEEKS(1922)\nNo. 724\nArgued: April 20, 1922Decided: May 29, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. S. T. Ansell, of Washington, D. C., and Charles Pope Caldwell, of New York City, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 327]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., and Frederick M. Brown, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the petition in this case a writ of mandamus is prayed for, commanding the Secretary of War to annual an order by him, purporting to have been made by direction and authority of the President, approving the action of a final classification board and retiring the relator, Col. John W. French, from active service in the Army, under the provisions of section 24b of the Army Reorganization Act, approved June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. 759, 773), and to restore him to the status of a colonel of infantry which he had before the order. The Secretary of War filed an answer, and, a demurrer thereto being sustained, the writ was allowed by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, as prayed for. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and the case is here on writ of error for construction of the statute, and on the question of the jurisdiction of the court of issue a writ of mandamus in such a case.\n The Army Reorganization Act is intended to provide for a reduction of the Army of the United States to a peace basis while maintaining a standard of high efficiency. To contribute to this purpose, Congress made elaborate provision in the act for retaining in the service officers who had proved their capacity and fitness for command and for retiring or discharging those who, for any reason, were found to be unfit. Every step of this process is committed to military tribunals, made up of officers who, by experience and training, should be the best qualified men in the country for such a duty, but with their action all subject, as we shall see, to the supervisory control of the President of the United States. \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n Not being in any sense a penal statute, the act should be liberally construed to promote its purpose, and it is of first importance that that purpose shall not be frustrated by unnecessarily placing technical limitations upon the agencies which are to carry it into effect. Street v. United States, \n133 U.S. 299\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 309.\n Section 24b deals only with the 'Classification of Officers,' and is printed in the margin. \n1\n The process provided by the section for classifying and reducing the number of officers, is as follows:\n First. The President shall convene a board of not less than five general officers, which shall arrange all officers in two classes, viz.:\n'Class A, consisting of officers who should be retained in the service, and class B, of officers who should not be retained in the service.'\n\n This classification is tentative and since it is intended simply to furnish a basis for further action the board will be referred to he has been placed in class B by the Preliminary \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n herein as the 'Preliminary Classification manner in which this board was convened or as to its composition.\n Section. If, when an officer is notificed that he has been placed in class B by the Preliminary Classification Board, he shall request, as Col. French did, an opportunity to appear before a Court of Inquiry, then--\n'he shall be furnished with a full copy of the official records upon which the proposed classification is based and shall be given an apportunity to present testimony in his own behalf.'\n\n The powers and procedure of such a Court of Inquiry are not defined in the section, but their definition is found in chapter 2 of the act, being Articles of War 97 to 103, inclusive (41 Stat. 807), in which it is provided, that such a Court of Inquiry 'shall consist of three or more officers' (article 98), that it 'shall not give an opinion on the merits \n___ Whenever an officer is placed in class B, a board of not less than three officers shall be convened to determine whether such classification is due to his neglect misconduct or avoidable habits. If the finding is affirmative, he shall be discharged from the Army; if negative, he shall be placed on the unlimited retired list with pay at the rate of 2 1\/2 per centum of his active pay multiplied by the number of complete years of commissioned service, or service which under the provisions of this act is counted as its equivalent, unless his total commissioned service or equivalent service shall be less than ten years, in which case he shall be honorably discharged with one year's pay. The maximum retired pay of an officer retired under the provisions of this section prior to January 1, 1924, shall be 74 per centum of active pay, and of one retired on or after that date, 60 per centum. If an officer is thus retired before the completion of thirty years' commissioned service, he may be employed on such active duty as the Secretary of War considers him capable of performing until he has completed thirty years' commissioned service. The board convened upon the passage of this act shall also report the names of those second lieutenants of the Quartermaster Corps who were commissioned under the provisions of section 9 of the Act of June 3, 1916, who are not qualified for further promotion. The officers so reported shall continue in the grade of second lieutenant for the remainder of their service and the others shall be placed upon the promotion list according to their commissioned service, as hereinbefore provide.' \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n of the case inquired into unless specially ordered to do so' (article 102), and that it 'shall keep a record of its proceedings, which shall ... be forwarded to the convening authority' (article 103). In this case, however, section 24b provides that the record of the Court of Inquiry shall be forwarded to the Final Classification Board.\n Third. After a hearing has been had by a Court of Inquiry the section requires that its record shall be forwarded to the Final Classification Board for reconsideration of the case--\n'and after such consideration the finding of said classification board shall be final and not subject to further revision except upon the order of the President.'\n\n No objection is made in this court to the manner of the convening nor to the membership of this board.\n Fourth. After the Final Classification Board has made a finding, if the President does not order further revision, and the officer who has demanded the Court of Inquiry is continued in class B, then the section provides that another 'board of not less than three officers shall be convened to determine whether such classification is due to his neglect, misconduct or avoidable habits. If the finding is affirmative, he shall be discharged from the Army; if negative, he shall be placed on the unlimited retired list with pay,' as provided in the section.\n This board will be hereinafter referred to as the 'Honest and Faithful Board,' a name by which it is commonly and widely designated. The action of this board is not and could not be complained of, for it was favorable to the relator.\n It is to be observed that there is no requirement in the section, that the officer whose case is under consideration shall either be notified of the hearing or that he shall be heard, by any of the tribunals thus provided for, except the Court of Inquiry.\n The facts essential to the decision of the case, derived from the allegations of the petition not denied in the \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n answer and from the allegations of the answer admitted by the demurrer, are as follows: When the relator was notified that he had been tentatively placed in class B as an officer not to be retained in the Army, he requested a Court of Inquiry, which was thereupon convened. He appeared before that court, was represented by counsel, and was given an opportunity to present testimony of himself and others in his behalf of which he availed himself.\n The record of the Court of Inquiry was forwarded to the Final Classification Board for reconsideration of the case, but the classification of relator in class B was adhered to by that board, and was approved by the Secretary of War, under authority from the President, which, it is averred and admitted by the demurrer, was given to him prior to any determination in the relator's case. Prior to the submission of the record of the Final Classification Board to the Honest and and Faithful Board for the purpose of having determined the cause of the relator's classification, the Secretary of War, 'acting on behalf of and by the authority of the President,' signed at the foot of that record the notation: 'Approved: Baker, Secretary of War.' After the Honest and Faithful Board has determined that relator's classification was not due to his own neglect, misconduct, or avoidable habits, he was retired from service by the following order:\n'Washington, D. C., December 24, 1920\n\n\n\n'The action of the Classification Board in finally classifying Col. John W. French, Infantry, in class B, is approved by the President, and, by his direction, a board of officers having determined that such classification is not due to the officer's neglect, misconduct or avoidable habits, Col. French is retired from active service, after twenty-two years of commissioned service, under the provision of section 24b of the act of Congress approved June 4, 1920.\n\n'Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War.' \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n Newton D. Baker having been succeeded by John W. Weeks as Secretary of War, Secretary by John W. Weeks as Secretary of War, Secretary Weeks was substituted as defendant\n\n While there are allegations in the petition that various formalities in the procedure prescribed by section 24b were not complied with, reliance is not placed upon any of these; in the assignments of error in this court and in argument the relator presses only one question upon our attention for decision, viz.:\n It is contended that section 24b imposes a personal, nondelegable, judicial duty upon the President, to review the record of the Board of Final Classification in each case after it has made a finding, and by his order to approve or disapprove it, and that because the approval in this case was not made by the President personally, but by the Secretary of War, acting under delegated general direction and authority from the President, it is void and must be so treated.\n The construction of the section thus contended for obviously would place such a burdensome, if not impossible, personal duty upon the President during the process of reducing the army from a war to a peace basis that, if Congress had intended to attempt such a thing, we may be sure its purpose would have been clearly expressed, and not left to doubtful implication.\n The argument for the relator is bottomed entirely upon the use of the words 'except upon the order of the President,' for there is nothing else in the section suggesting participation by the President after the convening of the Preliminary Classification Board, and we are thus brought to consider the construction which should be placed upon these seven words.\n To give the effect claimed for the words by the relator would result in deyning any meaning whatever to the clear and emphatic declaration immediately preceding them that 'the finding of said Classification Board shall \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n be final and not subject to further revision,' for it would render such finding ineffective in every case until approved by the President, and then, of course, its effect and finality would be derived from the President's approval, and not from the finding of the board, which would be rendered, at most, merely advisory. Familiar principles (United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460; Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612; Montclair v. Ramsdell, \n107 U.S. 147\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 391), forbid the acceptance of such a construction, save under the compulsion of a clear expression of congressional purpose, such as is not to be found in either the section or the act we are considering.\n But both the meaning and purpose of the entire expression seem very clear. The declaration that the finding of the Final Classification Board shall be 'final and not subject to further revision' could not be more emphatically worded, while the exception 'upon the order of the President' is in such general terms that it plainly contemplates only discretionary action on his part to be taken, on the suggestion of the Secretary of War in special cases, on the application of officers involved or their friends, or on his own 'mere motion.' The exception plainly enought was inserted, not for the purpose of imposing a very great burden upon the President, but rather as a congressional recognition of the right in him as the Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the Army (a right which he probably would have had without it), to interfere in such cases at his option, leaving the finding of the board to become final, should he elect not to take any action, and perhaps, also, for the purpose of forestalling the chance of its being successfully argued that the unusual finality-'not subject to further revision'-given to the finding of the board was intended to place such finding beyond the power of interposition in any case by the President. This construction gives consistent effect to each clause of the provision, and that contended for by the relator must be denied. \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 334]\n\u00a0\n In support of his contention, which has thus been rejected, the relator relies upon Runkle v. United States, \n122 U.S. 543\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1141, United States v. Page, \n137 U.S. 673\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 219, and United States v. Fletcher, \n148 U.S. 84\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 552. All of these were court-martial cases, conducted under authority of the then sixty-fifth Article of War (2 Stat. 367, c. 20) which prescribed that the sentence of such a court in cases such as were there under consideration should not be carried into execution--\n'until after the whole proceedings shall have been transmitted to the Secretary of War, to be laid before the President of the United States for his confirmation or disapproval and orders in the case.'\n\n It was held, obviously enough, that the quoted language called for personal review and action by the President, and that making him, as it did, it effect, a member of the court, the required review was judicial in character, and therefore nondelegable. The difference between such a statute and the one we have here renders these decisions too plainly inapplicable for discussion.\n Under the construction of section 24b thus arrived at, neither personal nor delegated approval by the President of the finding by the Final Board of Classification was necessary before action by the Honest and Faithful Board, and, if no action whatever had been taken by him through the agency of the Secretary of War that finding, by force of the express words of the statute, would have become 'final and not subject to further review,' and thereupon the case would have been ripe for the further action prescribed by the statute.\n Since the section did not require personal action by the President, the action on his behalf and by his authority, taken by the Secretary of War, was in a legally sufficient form. R. S.  216 (Comp. St.  318); Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; Williams v. United States, 1 How. 290, 297; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. of Idaho v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 351, 357\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 625. \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 335]\n\u00a0\n But the Court of Appeals held that the action of the Secretary of War, which is assailed in the case, was taken in the exercise of duly delegated administrative power of the President and was really executive action by him which the courts may not control by mandamus or otherwise, and that therefore the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia was without jurisdiction and void.\n As a colonel in the Army, the relator was subject to military law, and the principles of that law, as provided by Congress, constituted for him due process of law in a constitutional sense. Reaves v. Ainsworth, \n219 \nU.S. 296, 304\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 230.\n By the demurrer it is admitted that the three boards and the Court of Inquiry, provided for by section 24b, were lawfuly convened and constituted. They obviously had jurisdiction over the relator and over the subject-matter involved, and there is no contention that any of them exceeded the scope of its lawful powers. The only infirmity claimed to exist in the entire proceeding is, that the review and approval of the findings of the Final Classification Board and the ultimate order retiring relator from the Army, were made by the Secretary of War, 'acting in the name of and by the authority of the President,' instead of by the President personally. But we have found this contention unsound and that the action of the President by the Secretary was a legally sufficient compliance with the act of Congress.\n Thus we have lawfully constituted military tribunals, with jurisdiction over the person and subject-matter involved unquestioned and unquestionable, and action by them within the scope of the power with which they are invested by law. It is settled beyond controversy that under such conditions decisions by military tribunals, constituted by act of Congress, cannot be reviewed or set aside by civil courts in a mandamus proceeding or otherwise. Johnson v. Sayre, \n158 \nU.S. 109, 118\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 773; Carter v. McClaughry, \n\n[259 U.S. 326, 336]\n\u00a0\n \n183 \nU.S. 365, 380\n, 381 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 181; Mullan v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 516, 520\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 330; Collins v. McDonald, \n258 U.S. 416\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 326, 66 L. Ed. --, decided April 10, 1922.\n'If it were otherwise, the civil courts would virtually administer the rules and articles of war, irrespective of those to whom that duty and obligation has been confided by the laws of the United States, from whose decisions no appeal or jurisdiction of any kind has been given to the civil magistrate or civil courts.' Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 82 (15 L. Ed. 838).\n\n It results that, because the action of the President, given effect by the order of the Secretary of War, was in full compliance with the act of Congress, and also because the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction to order the writ of mandamus prayed for, the judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of that court must be Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 24b. Classification of Officers.-Immediately upon the passage of this act, and in September of 1921 and every year thereafter, the President shall convene a board of not less than five general officers, which shall arrange all officers in two classes, namely: Class A, consisting of officers who should be retained in the service, and class B, of officers who should not be retained in the service. Until otherwise finally classified, all officers shall be regarded as belonging to class A, and shall be promoted according to the provisions of this act to fill any vacanices which may occur prior to such final classification.

It is further provided that nothing in the section shall apply to the dispensing or distribution of any of the drugs to a patient of a registered physician in the course of his professional practice only, or to the sale, dispensing or distribution of said drugs by a dealer to a consumer in pursuance of a written prescription issued by a physician registered under the act. \n\n[258 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n The indictment charges that the defendant did unlawfully sell, barter, and give to Willie King a compound, manufacture, and derivative of opium, to wit, 150 grains of heroin and 360 grains of morphine, and a compound, manufacture, and derivative of coca leaves, to wit, 210 grains of cocaine, not in pursuance of any written order of King on a form issued for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States; that the defendant was a duly licensed physician and registered under the act, and issued three written orders to the said King in the form of prescriptions signed by him, which prescriptions called for the delivery to King of the amount of drugs above described; that the defendant intended that King should obtain the drugs from the druggist upon the said orders; that King did obtain upon said orders drugs of the amount and kind above described pursuant to the said prescriptions; that King was a person addicted to the habitual use of morphine, heroin, and cocaine, and known by the defendant to be so addicted; that King did not require the administration of either morphine, heroin, or cocaine by reason of any disease other than such addiction; that defendant did not dispense any of the drugs for the purpose of treating any disease or condition other than such addiction; that none of the drugs so dispensed by the defendant was administered to or intended by the defendant to be administered to King by the defendant or any nurse, or person acting under the direction of the defendant, nor were any of the drugs consumed or intended to be consumed by King in the presence of the defendant, but that all of the drugs were put in the possession or control of King, with the intention on the part of the defendant that King would use the same by self-administration in divided doses over a period of several days, the amount of each of said drugs dispensed being more than sufficient or necessary to satisfy the craving of King therefor, if consumed by him all at one \n\n[258 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n time; that King was not in any way restrained or prevented from disposing of the drugs in any manner he saw fit; and that the drugs so dispensed by the defendant were in the form in which said drugs are usually consumed by persons addicted to the habitual use thereof to satisfy their craving therefor, and were adapted for such consumption.\n The question is: Do the acts charged in this indictment constitute an offense within the meaning of the statute. As we have seen, the statute contains an exception to the effect that it shall not apply to the dispensing or distribution of such drugs to a patient by a registered physician in the course of his professional practice only, nor to the sale, dispensing, or distribution of the drugs by a dealer to a consumer under a written prescription by a registered physician. The rule applicable to such statutes is that it is enough to charge facts sufficient to show that the accused is not within the exception. United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 173.\n The District Judge who heard this case was of the opinion that prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such quantity to addicts as charged in the indictment, but out of deference to what he deemed to be the view of a local District Judge in another case announced his willingness to follow such opinion until the question could be passed upon by this court, and sustained the demurrer. In our opinion the District Judge who heard the case was right in his conclusion and should have overruled the demurrer.\n Former decisions of this court have held that the purpose of the exception is to confine the distribution of these drugs to the regular and lawful course of professional practice, and that not everything called a prescription is necessarily such. Webb v. United States, \n249 U.S. 96\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 217; Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, \n254 U.S. 189\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 98. \n\n[258 U.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n Of this phase of the act this court said in the Jin Fuey Moy Case, 254 U. S. at page 194, 41 Sup. Ct. 100:\n'Manifestly the phrases 'to a patient' and 'in the course of his professional practice only' are intended to confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy he craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A 'prescription' issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it. Webb v. United States, \n249 U.S. 96\n.'\n\n It is enough to sustain an indictment that the offense be described with sufficient clearness to show a violation of law, and to enable the accused to know the nature and cause of the accusation and to plead the judgment, if one be rendered, in bar of further prosecution for the same offense. If the offense be a statutory one, and intent or knowledge is not made an element of it, the indictment need not charge such knowledge or intent. United States v. Smith, 2 Mason, 143, Fed. Cas. No. 16,338; United States v. Miller, Fed. Cas. No. 15,775; United States v. Jacoby, Fed. Cas. No. 15,462; United States v. Ulrici, Fed. Cas. No. 16,594 (opinion by Miller, Circuit Justice); United States v. Bayaud (C. C.) 16 Fed. 376, 383, 374; United States v. Jackson (C. C.) 25 Fed. 548, 550; United States v. Guthrie (E. C.) 171 Fed. 528, 531; United States v. Balint & Randazzo, \n258 U.S. 250\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 301, 66 L. Ed. --, this day decided.\n It may be admitted that to prescribe a single does, or even a number of doses may not bring a physician within the penalties of the act; but what is here charged is that the defendant physician by means of prescriptions has enabled one, known by him to be an addict, to obtain from a pharmacist the enormous number of doses contained in 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, \n\n[258 U.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n and 210 grains of cocaine. As shown by Wood's United States Dispensatory, a standard work in general use, the ordinary does of morphine is one-fifth of a grain, of cocaine one-eighth to one-fourth of a grain, of heroin one- sixteenth to one-eighth of a grain. By these standards more than 3,000 ordinary doses were placed in the control of King. Undoubtedly doses may be varied to suit different cases as determined by the judgment of a physician. But the quantities named in the indictment are charged to have been intrusted to a person known by the physician to be an addict without restraint upon him in its administration or disposition by anything more than his own weakened and perverted will. Such so-called prescriptions could only result in the gratification of a diseased appetite for these pernicious drugs or result in an unlawful parting with them to others in violation of the act as heretofore interpreted in this court within the principles laid down in the Webb and Jin Fuey Moy Cases, supra.\n We hold that the acts charged in the indictment constituted an offense within the terms and meaning of the act. The judgment of the District Court to the contrary should be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n If this case raised a question of pleading I should go far in agreeing to disregard technicalities that were deemed vital a hundred or perhaps even fifty years ago. But we have nothing to do with pleading as such, and as the Judge below held the indictment bad it can be sustained only upon a construction of the statute different from that adopted below.\n The indictment for the very purpose of raising the issue that divides the Court alleges in terms that the drugs \n\n[258 U.S. 280, 290]\n\u00a0\n were intended by the defendant to be used by King in divided doses over a period of several days. The defendant was a licensed physician and his part in the sale was the giving of prescriptions for the drugs. In view of the allegation that I have quoted and the absence of any charge to the contrary it must be assumed that he gave them in the regular course of his practice and in good faith. Whatever ground for scepticism we may find in the facts we are bound to accept the position knowingly and deliberately taken by the pleader and evidently accepted by the Court below.\n It seems to me impossible to construe the statute as tacitly making such acts, however foolish, crimes, by saying that what is in form a prescription and is given honestly in the course of a doctor's practice, and therefore, so far as the words of the statute go, is allowed in terms, is not within the words, is not a prescription and is not given in the course of practice, if the Court deems the doctor's faith in his patient manifestly unwarranted. It seems to me wrong to construe the statute as creating a crime in this way without a word of warning. Of course the facts alleged suggest an indictment in a different form, but the Government preferred to trust to a strained interpretation of the law rather than to the finding of a jury upon the facts. I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BETHLEHEM STEEL CO(1922)\nNo. 127\nArgued: March 16, 1922Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Daniel L. Morris, of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[258 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Geo. W. Dalzell, of Washington, D. C., Clarence P. Byrnes, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and Robert C. Hayden, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n\n[258 U.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit by the Steel Company to recover royalties for the use by the United States of a patented invention owned by the company.\n On November 7, 1891, the United States by and through the Ordnance Bureau of the War Department contracted with the Bethlehem Iron Company for the manufacture of 100 guns of 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch caliber, which were to be equipped with the usual breech mechanism then known as 'Model 1888 M 2.'\n On November 21, 1893, and pending the execution of the contract, Owen F. Leibert, an employee of the Bethlehem Iron Company, made application for an improvement in breech mechanism for ordnance. The company notified the Bureau of the invention and of an application for a patent. It suggested that the Bureau have the application made special. This the Bureau did and a patent was issued to Leibert on March 20, 1894\n\n\n In February, 1894, the Bureau requested full information as to the patent and that it be permitted to use the same at the Watervliet Arsenal in an experimental test on a 12-inch gun. The request was granted and the Bureau prepared drawings for the test.\n On December 23, 1895, while the Leibert mechanism was in course of construction the Chief of Ordnance forwarded to the commanding officer of the Arsenal a communication \n\n[258 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n showing a form of mechanism saying that it seemed to possess marked merit and that it was a modification of the Leibert design, from which it differed 'mainly in the mode of operating the withdrawal block, and in the pitch of the segmental rack to give increased power for rotation.'\n The commanding officer reported that the design was deemed superior to the other designs and that he had ordered its manufacture, as suggested by the Chief of Ordnance he should do in such case. It was thereafter manufactured and used by the United States on a number of guns.\n The design that was used was prepared by John W. Stockett, a draftsman in the Ordnance Bureau, and was known and referred to as the 'Stockett design,' and the 'Department design,' but more generally as 'Model 1895.' Stockett applied for and received a patent for the design.\n From time to time during 1894 to 1896 the Ordnance Bureau considered different forms of mechanism, and the company notified the Bureau that work under the contract had reached a point that it was necessary to know the mechanism to be used, and requested that if any change was to be made the company be notified. The Bureau replied that it had no objection to the use of the 'Model 1895.' The company answered that it had no objection to conforming to that design, provided no modification be made in the price to be paid for the guns named in the contract on account of change in the breech mechanism. March 3, 1898, the Ordnance Bureau indicated its assent to that proposition.\n On August 16, 1901, the Bethlehem Iron Company assigned all of its rights and franchises to the Bethlehem Steel Company and the latter company asked that it be recognized as the successor to the Iron Company. \n\n[258 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n This was refused, and the Bureau entered into an independent contract with the Steel Company, and Congress subsequently (June 6, 1902) authorized the Steel Company to be the successor to the Iron Company.\n On November 5, 1902, the Steel Company reported that it was proceeding with its contracts using the compound gear wheel shown in its prints 7374 and 7381, copies of which it inclosed, also a copy of the Leibert patent, and said:\n'We believe that the wheel we are now putting on the guns, as stated and which we understand the department is also using on its guns built elsewhere, of several calibers, is the same as that described in claim 1 et seq. of the said patent. We should be glad if the department, at its convenience, would give us an opportunity to lay before it more fully our views in this regard.'\n\n In reply to the above-quoted letter, the Chief of Ordnance, on February 25, 1903, wrote the Steel Company as follows:\n'Referring to your communication of November 5, 1902, upon the subject of breech mechanism for guns of 1895 model, I have the honor to state that the claims in the patent of Owen F. Leibert, owned by you, are so much involved with the original designs of Farcot and the patents of F. F. Fletcher and John W. Stockett that this department does not feel that it is in a position to pass on the legal aspects of the case. If the Bethlehem Steel Company will bring suit to establish the points involved, this office will lend its assistance in bringing before the court all documents on hand pertaining to the subject.'\n\n On February 27, 1903, the Steel Company responded to the above letter of the Ordnance Bureau as follows:\n'In accordance with your suggestion we have instructed our attorney to bring suit against the department, to establish the points involved.' \n\n[258 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n The findings contain a detail of the mechanisms of the Leibert patent and the Stockett patent with copies of the letters patent.\n\n The findings also give a list of patents constituting the prior art at the time of Leibert's application, in which was included the patent of F. F. Fletcher mentioned in the last letter (February 25, 1903) of the Chief of Ordnance to the Steel Company. And it was found that none of the patents of the prior art anticipated the Leibert design and that it was a patentable advance upon them, and it was further found that the combination of claims 1, 2 and 3 of it were found in 'Model 1895.'\n From its findings the court deduced the ultimate facts: (1) That the breech mechanisms of the Leibert patent possessed patentable novelty, utility and invention; and (2) that those mechanisms were used by the United States 'in and as a part of the said 'Model 1895.\" And it ordered and adjudged that the Steel Company have and recover from the United States the sum of $67,000.\n There is but one question in the case, and that is the attitude of the Ordnance Bureau, representing the United States, toward the Leibert patent, whether in recognition of it, as contended by the Steel Company, or in opposition to, or, it may be said, in tortious use of, it, as contended by the United States.\n We have in other cases expressed our aversion to the latter conclusion, except upon explicit declaration or upon a course of proceedings tantamount to it. A contract, express or implied in fact, must, it is true, be established; but one to pay for a mechanism used will be implied rather than a tortious appropriation of it-rather than the exercise by the United States of its sovereignty in aggression upon the rights of its citizens.\n The Court of Claims so construed our cases. Mr. Justice Booth, speaking for the court, said the difficulty was \n\n[258 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n more in the application of the determining rule than in its ascertainment. And further:\n'From cases heretofore adjudicated upon similar principles it may be safely asserted that, where the government uses a patented invention 'with the consent and express permission of the owner' and does not 'repudiate the title of such owner,' an implied contract to pay a reasonable compensation for such usage arises.' 53 Ct. Cl. 357.\n\n United States v. Berdan Firearms Co., \n156 U.S. 552\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 420, and United States v. Societe Anonyme, etc., \n224 U.S. 320\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 479, were cited.\n We think the cases sustain the principle announced and we concur in it. And the findings demonstrate that it is sustained in the present case. There can be no doubt that the Ordnance Bureau knew that the Stockett design could only be used with the Leibert mechanism, and though declining, as it said, to pass 'on the legal aspect' of such use, it would 'lend its assistance in bringing before the court all documents on hand pertaining to the subject.' This necessarily means that it would accept the decision as a determination of the right of the company and the obligation of the United States. In other words, its attitude was not that of repudiation, not that even of antagonism, but that of submission to and acceptance of the right as it should be declared, and certainly consideration for the rights of inventors, instead of aggression upon them, is a policy of wisdom regarding the purpose of the War Department and, it may be, its necessities. It gives incentive to the inventive genius of the country by assuring recognition and reward to its work, if its work have merit. It is to be remembered that the government is the only user of heavy ordnance and must encourage, not deter its improvement, if it, the government, would keep ready for whatever emergency may come to it.\n We think, therefore, that the judgment of the Court of Claims sould be, and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BOWMAN(1922)\nNo. 69\nArgued: October 17, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act (34 Stat. c. 2564, p. 1246 [Comp. St.  1704]) to review the ruling of the District Court sustaining a demurrer of one of the defendants to an indictment for a conspiracy to defraud a corporation in which the United States was and is a stockholder, under section 35 of the Criminal Code, as amended October 23, 1918 (40 Stat. 1015 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10199]).\n During the period covered by the indictment, i. e., between October, 1919, and January, 1920, the steamship Dio belonged to the United States. The United States owned all the stock in the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. The National Shipping Corporation agreed to operate and manage the Dio for the Fleet Corporation, which under the contract was to pay for fuel, oil, labor, and material used in the operation. The Dio was on a voyage to Rio Janeiro under this management. Wry was her master, Bowman was her engineer, Hawkinson was the agent of the Standard Oil Company at Rio Janeiro, and Millar was a merchant and ship repairer and engineer in Rio. Of these four, who were the defendants in the indictment, the first three were American citizens, and Millar was a British subject. Johnston & Co. were the agents of the National Shipping Corporation at Rio. The indictment charged that the plot was hatched by Wry and Bowman on board the Dio before she reached Rio. Their plan was to order, through Johnston & Co., and receipt for, 1,000 tons of fuel oil from the Standard Oil Company, but to take only 600 tons aboard, and to collect cash for a delivery of 1,000 tons through Johnston & Co., from the Fleet Corporation, and then divide the money paid for the undelivered 400 tons among the four defendants. This \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n plan was to be, and was, made possible through the guilty connivance of the Standard Oil agent, Hawkinson, and Millar, the Rio merchant, who was to, and did, collect the money. Overt acts charged included a wireless telegram to the agents, Johnston & Co., from the Dio while on the high seas ordering the 1,000 tons of oil. The Southern District of New York was the district into which the American defendants were first brought and were found, but Millar, the British defendant, has not been found.\n The first count charged a conspiracy by the defendants to defraud the Fleet Corporation, in which the United States was a stockholder, by obtaining and aiding to obtain the payment and allowance of a false and fraudulent claim against the Fleet Corporation. It laid the offense on the high seas, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, and out of the jurisdiction of any district of the United States, but within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. The second count laid the conspiracy on the Dio on the high seas and at the port of Rio Janeiro, as well as in the city. The third count laid it in the city of Rio Janeiro. The fourth count was for making and causing to be made in the name of the Standard Oil Company, for payment and approval, a false and fraudulent claim against the Fleet Corporation in the form of an invoice for 1,000 tons of fuel oil, of which 400 tons were not delivered. This count laid the same crime on board the Dio in the harbor of Rio Janeiro. The fifth count laid it in the city, and the sixth at the port and in the city.\n No objection was made to the indictment or any count of it for lack of precision of fulness in describing all the elements of the crimes denounced in section 35 of the Criminal Code as amended. The sole objection was that the crime was committed without the jurisdiction of the United States or of any state thereof and on the high seas or \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n within the jurisdiction of Brazil. The District Court considered only the first count, which charged the conspiracy to have been committed on the Dio on the high seas, and, having held that bad for lack of jurisdiction, a fortiori it sustained the demurrer as the others.\n The court in its opinion conceded that under many authorities the United States as a sovereign may regulate the ships under its flag and the conduct of its citizens while on those ships, and cited to this point Crapo v. Kelly, 16 Wall. 610, 623-632; United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249, 260\n, 261 S., 264, 265, 14 Sup. Ct. 109; The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 405 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 133; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n, 574; United States v. Smiley, 6 Sawyer, 640, 645, Fed Cas. No. 16,317. The court said, however, that while private and public ships of the United States on the high seas were constructively a part of the territory of the United States-indeed, peculiarly so, as distinguished from that of the States-Congress had always expressly indicated it when it intended that its laws should be operative on the high seas. The court concluded that, because jurisdiction of criminal offenses must be conferred upon United States courts and could not be inferred, and because section 35, like all the other sections of chapter 4 (Comp. St.  10191- 10252), contains no reference to the high seas as a part of the locus of the offense defined by it, as the sections in chapters 11 and 12 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10445-10483a) do, section 35 must be construed not to extend to acts committed on the high seas. It confirmed its conclusion by the statement that section 35 had never been invoked to punish offenses denounced, if committed on the high seas or in a foreign country.\n We have in this case a question of statutory construction. The necessary locus, when not specially defined, depends upon the purpose of Congress as evinced by the description and nature of the crime and upon the territorial limitations upon the power and jurisdiction of a \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n government to punish crime under the law of nations. Crimes against private individuals or their property, like assaults, murder, burglary, larceny, robbery, arson, embezzlement, and frauds of all kinds, which affect the peace and good order of the community must, of course, be committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the government where it may properly exercise it. If punishment of them is to be extended to include those committed out side of the strict territorial jurisdiction, it is natural for Congress to say so in the statute, and failure to do so will negative the purpose of Congress in this regard. We have an example of this in the attempted application of the prohibitions of the antitrust law to acts done by citizens of the United States against other such citizens in a foreign country. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047. That was a civil case, but as the statute is criminal as well as civil, it appears an analogy.\n But the same rule of interpretation should not be applied to criminal statutes which are, as a class, not logically dependent on their locality for the government's jurisdiction, but are enacted because of the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction, or fraud wherever perpetrated, especially if committed by its own citizens, officers, or agents. Some such offenses can only be committed within the territorial jurisdiction diction of the government because of the local acts required to constitute them. Others are such that to limit their locus to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home. In such cases, Congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries, but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense. Many of these occur in chapter 4, which bears the title 'Offenses \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n against the Operation of the Government.' Section 70 of that chapter (Comp. St.  10238) punishes whoever as consul knowingly certifles a false invoice. Clearly the locus of this crime as intended by Congress is in a foreign country, and certainly the foreign country in which he discharges his official duty could not object to the trial in a United States court of a United States consul for crime of this sort committed within its borders. Forging or altering ship's papers is made a crime by section 72 of chapter 4 (Comp. St.  10240). It would be going too far to say that because Congress does not fix any locus it intended to exclude the high seas in respect of this crime. The natural inference from the character of the offense is that the sea would be a probable place for its commission. Section 42 of chapter 4 (Comp. St.  10206) punishes enticing desertions from the naval service. Is it possible that Congress did not intend by this to include such enticing done aboard ship on the high seas or in a foreign port, where it would be most likely to be done? Section 39 (Comp. St  10203) punishes bribing a United States officer of the civil, military, or naval service to violate his duty or to aid in committing a fraud on the United States. It is hardly reasonable to construe this not to include such offenses when the bribe is offered to a consul, ambassador, and army or a naval officer in a foreign country or on the high seas, whose duties are being performed there, and when his connivance at such fraud must occur there. So, too, section 38 of chapter 4 (Comp. St.  10202) punishes the willfully doing or aiding to do any act relating to the bringing in, custody, sale or other disposition of property captured as prize, with intent to defraud, delay or injure the United States or any captor or claimant of such property. This would naturally often occur at sea, and Congress could not have meant to confine it to the land of the United States. Again, in section 36 of chapter 4 (Comp. St.  10200), it is made a crime to steal, embezzle, or knowingly apply to his own use ordinance, arms, ammunition, clothing, subsistence stores, money or other property of the United \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n States furnished or to be used for military or naval service. It would hardly be reasonable to hold that if any one, certainly if a citizen of the United States, were to steal or embezzle such property which may properly and lawfully be in the custody of army or naval officers either in foreign countries, in foreign ports or on the high seas, it would not be in such places an offense which Congress intended to punish by this section.\n What is true of these sections in this regard is true of section 35, under which this indictment was drawn. We give it in full in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[260 U.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n It is directed generally against whoever presents a false claim against the United States, knowing it to be such, to any officer of the civil, military or naval service or to any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States is a stockholder, or whoever connives at the same by the use of any cheating device, or whoever enters a conspiracy to do these things. The section was amended in 1918 to include a corporation in which the United States owns stock. Tiis was evidently intended to protect the Emergency Fleet Corporation in which the \n___ or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, or willfully to conceal such money or other property, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to any person having authority to receive the same any amount of such money or other property less than that for which he received a certificate or took a receipt; or whoever, being authorized to make or deliver any certificate, voucher, receipt, or other paper certifying the receipt of arms, ammunition, provisions, clothing, or other property so used or to be used, shall make or deliver the same to any other person without a full knowledge of the truth of the facts stated therein and with intent to defraud the United States, or any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. And whoever shall purchase, or receive in pledge, from any person any arms, equipment, ammunition, clothing, military stores, or other property furnished by the United States, under a clothing allowance or otherwise, to any soldier, sailor, officer, cadet, or midshipman in the military or naval service of the United States or of the National Guard or Naval Militia, or to any person accompanying, serving, or retained with the land or naval forces and subject to military or naval law, having knowledge or reason to believe that the property has been taken from the possession of the United States or furnished by the United States under such allowance, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 102]\n\u00a0\n United States was the sole stockholder, from fraud of this character. That corporation was expected to engage in, and did engage in, a most extensive ocean transportation business, and its ships were seen in every great port of the world open during the war. The same section of the statute protects the arms, ammunition, stores, and property of the army and navy from fraudulent devices of a similar character. We cannot suppose that when Congress enacted the statute or amended it, it did not have in mind that a wide field for such frauds upon the government was in private and public vessels of the United States on the high seas and in foreign ports and beyond the land jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore intended to include them in the section.\n Nor can the much-quoted rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed avail. As said in United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 629\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 625, 627 (33 L. Ed. 1080), quoting with approval from Sedgwick, Statutory and Const. Law (2d. Ed.) 288:\n'Penal provisions, like all others, are to be fairly construed according to the legislative intent as expressed in the enactment.'\n\n They are not to be strained either way. It needs no forced construction to interpret section 35 as we have done.\n Section 41 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1023) provides that:\n'The trial of all offenses committed upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district, shall be in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first brought.'\n\n The three defendants whe were found in New York were citizens of the United States, and were certainly subject to such laws as it might pass to protect itself and its property. Clearly it is no offense to the dignity or right of sovereignty of Brazil to hold them for this crime against the government to which they owe allegiance. The other defendant is a subject of Great Britain. He has never been apprehended, and it will be time enough to consider what, if any, jurisdiction the District \n\n[260 U.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n Court below has to punish him when he is brought to trial.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed, with directions to overrule the demurrer and for further proceedings. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 35 of the Criminal Code, as amended October 23, 1918 (40 Stat. 1015), is as follows:\n Whoever shall make or cause to be made or present or cause to be presented, for payment or approval, to or by any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States, or any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, any claim upon or against the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent; or whoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of such claim, or for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the government of the United States, or any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry; or whoever shall take and carry away or take for his own use or for the use of another, with intent to steal or purloin, any personal property of the United States, or any branch or department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder; or whoever shall enter into any agreement, combination, or conspiracy to defraud the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, by obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance lowance of any false or fraudulent claim; and whoever, having charge, possession, custody, or control of any money or other public property used or to be used in the military or naval service, with intent to defraud the United States, or any department thereof, \n\n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. COOK(1922)\nNo. 80\nArgued: January 13, 1922Decided: January 13, 1922\n\n\nDecided. Feb. 27, 1922.\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 523, 524]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. R. Harr, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Eames and Young, architects of St. Louis, made the plans for a custom house at San Francisco and supervised its construction. They were to receive compensation at the rate of 5 per centum upon the actual cost of the work. The work was long delayed, three years, by the San Francisco earthquake and fire, which increased the cost of labor and materials. Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, within a limit of $250, 000, to make good to the contractor his loss from the delay and enhanced prices, so that he should receive enough to recoup \n\n[257 U.S. 523, 525]\n\u00a0\n him for his outlay, but without profit. The architects claimed from the government 5 per centum on the extra amount paid to the contractor. Eames died, and Cook, his executor, joining with the surviving partner, Young, brought this suit in the Court of Claims. The Court of Claims gave judgment for $5,085.38, the full amount of the claim. The government appeals.\n The contract provided that the fee of the architects was to be computed at the rate of 5 per centum upon 'the actual cost of the work executed from the drawings and specifications, as shown upon the books of the supervising architect's office, by the net amounts of contracts awarded and proposals accepted for additions and deductions.' Until the actual cost could be determined, the monthly payments were to be on the proposed cost as estimated from time to time by the government, and upon the completion of the building the entire fee was to be computed on the actual construction cost of the work executed from the architect's drawings and specifications and under their supervision, as shown upon the books of the supervising architect's office. The extra amount paid the contractor was in fact shown upon the books of the supervising architect's office, though not, of course, included in the total cost stated before the passage of the act and the ascertainment of the amount due thereunder.\n The clause in the Sundry Civil Appropriation Act approved May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 318, providing for an extra payment to the contractor was as follows:\n'The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized, upon completion of the custom house in ... San Francisco, California, to pay to Thomas Butler, the contractor for the construction of said building, in addition to the contract price therefor, such sum as may be equitable and just to reimburse said contractor for any loss actually sustained \n\n[257 U.S. 523, 526]\n\u00a0\n in consequence of the earthquake and great fire of April, 1906, not exceeding the sum of $250,000: Provided, that the amount allowed said Thomas Butler shall not be sufficient to enable him to make any profit out of the making and execution of said contract.'\n\n The committee appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust the claim found that the actual increased cost to the contractor of constructing the building due to delay and the increased prices of labor and material was $101,907.66. During the delay of three years, the architects under their subsidiary contract had to keep a superintendent of construction on the building at a cost of $6,700, and their office and certain contingent expenses in San Francisco went on.\n The government contends that the amount awarded to the contractor under the act was a mere gratuity and cannot be properly treated as a part of the cost of construction. We cannot agree to this view. It seems to us that this was an alteration of the contract in response to equitable considerations. It was a change from unit prices to a cost plus nothing contract. It was not a mere lump sum gift. It was the result of inspection and examination, as directed by Congress, and an award by actual estimates. It was the result of a change in the contract terms made by the principal, in whose name and for whose benefit the contract was entered into, and acquiesced in by the contractor. It added to 'the actual cost of the work executed from the drawings and specifications and under the architects' supervision as shown upon the books of the supervising architect's office, by the net amounts of contracts awarded and proposals accepted for additions and deductions.' The additional sum was part of the net amount of the contracts awarded, as they were legally modified by the agreement of the parties embodied in the clause of the congressional act. The \n\n[257 U.S. 523, 527]\n\u00a0\n architects' subsidiary contract for compensation contemplated changes in the amount of actual cost by additions and deductions; i. e., by changes in the main contract, and a postponement of final calculation until the full actual cost had been ascertained. The change by legislation was, of course, not within the minds of the parties when the work was entered upon, because the earthquake and fire and change of situation were not anticipated. This, however, is not enough to exclude it from the operation of the architects' contract, if the change can be brought fairly within the terms.\n It is not helpful to point out that the United States need not have varied the terms of the main contract, or that no consideration moved to it in the change, or that the contractor could not have recovered anything additional in a suit without the legislation. There was the moral consideration which properly induced the recognition of an honorable obligation and turned an unenforceable equity into a binding and effective provision.\n Reference is made to Frisbie v. United States, \n157 U.S. 166\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 586, and other cases, in which a pension is said to be a gift, and not a vested right. These cases have no bearing on the one before us. They merely establish that Congress, in shaping the form of its bounty, may impose conditions and limitations on its acquisition and enjoyment by the beneficiaries which it could not impose on the use and enjoyment by them of a vested right.\n An authority more helpful in the present case is that of United States v. Realty Co., \n163 U.S. 427\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1120. The question there was the validity of an appropriation by Congress of money to reimburse sugar planters who on the faith of a sugar bounty provided by statute, Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 694\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 495, had planted a crop and were subjected to heavy loss by repeal of the statute. The government objected that the sugar bounty was unconstitutional and that Congress could not pay such a bounty either by \n\n[257 U.S. 523, 528]\n\u00a0\n prior appropriation or by reimbursement. This court found it unnecessary to decide whether a sugar bounty was beyond the power of Congress, but, assuming its invalidity, held that, even though, in its purely legal aspect, an invalid law could not be made the basis of a legal claim, the planter had acquired a claim against the government of 'an equitable, moral, or honorary nature,' that Congress had power to pay the debts of the United States, that the nation, speaking broadly, owed a 'debt' to an individual when his claim grew out of right and justice-when, in other words, it was based upon considerations of a moral or merely honorary nature-and that the power of Congress extended to the payment of such a debt. The claim of the contractor in this case was more concrete than that of the sugar planter, and was equitably recognized by Congress as part of the cost of the building to be paid by the government.\n The architects had just as great an equity in this matter as the contractor. The delays and rise in the prices affected their expenses proportionately. When, therefore, the contractor has received more for the work, it is just that the architects receive a percentage on what has thus been recognized by the government as a 'debt' to the contractor for his work, and the words of the contract are inclusive enough to permit this to be done.\n The fact that the architects unsuccessfully applied to Congress for relief similar to that accorded to the contractor is relied on as an admission by the architects that only by congressional action, could they have equity done them. We do not consider this material or important. We cannot say from anything before us, but that the reason why Congress did not make special provision for the architects was the assumption that their equities might be worked out under their contract as they have been by this judgment of the Court of Claims.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. M RICE & CO(1922)\nNo. 114\nArgued: January 26, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Hoppin, for the United States.\n Mr. J. Stuart Tompkins, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the sufficiency of a protest necessary to justify a suit against the United States for duties illegally exacted. The board of general appraisers found the protest defective and refused relief. The Court of Customs Appeals on appeal reversed this action and gave judgment for the importer. 10 Ct. Cust. App. 165. The case comes here by certiorari under section 195 of the Judicial Code, as amended August 22, 1914, 38 Stat. 703 (Comp. St.  1186).\n The subject of importation was immortelles. They were entered April 3, 1916, at the port of Philadelphia, and the duty was liquidated June 8, 1916. The collector levied duty on them at 60 per cent. ad valorem under paragraph 347, Schedule N, of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913, 38 Stat. 114, 148 (Comp. St.  5291). The protest of the importer of July 7, 1916, set forth that the immortelles were dutiable 'at the rate of 25 per cent. ad valorem under the first clause of paragraph 210 as palms or cut flowers, preserved or fresh.' 38 Stat. 114, 133.\n The question as to the proper classification of the immortelles was settled by a decision of the Court of Customs Appeals in Bayersdorfer v. United States, 7 Ct. Cust. App. 66, and the legal duty is conceded to be 25 per cent. ad valorem by resemblance to the articles named in paragraph 210, Schedule G. The sole question here is whether under the form of protest presented the importer could rely upon the similitude clause ( paragraph 386, Schedule N), of the statute and claim that the immortelles were taxable at the rate fixed \n\n[257 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n in paragraph 210, because of their resemblance to articles therein described.\n Paragraph N of the Tariff Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 114, 187 (Comp. St.  5595), provides:\n'That the decision of the collector as to the rate and amount of duties chargeable upon imported merchandise ... shall be final and conclusive against all persons interested therein, unless the owner, importer, consignee, or agent of such merchandise ... shall, within thirty days after but not before such ascertainment and liquidation of duties, ... if dissatisfied with such decision imposing a higher rate of duty, ... file a protest or protests in writing with the collector, setting forth therein distinctly and specifically, and in respect to each entry or payment, the reasons for his objection thereto. ...'\n\n The relevant part of paragraph 386 of the same act provides that--\n'Each and every imported article, not enumerated in this section, which is similar, either in material, quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated in this section as chargeable with duty, shall pay the same rate of duty which is levied on the enumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned. ...'\n\n The point here raised has long been in dispute. In Hahn v. Erhardt, 78 Fed. 620, 24 C. C. A. 265 (1897), the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit held that mention in the protest of the paragraph fixing the duty on specifically described articles, without more, would not give the collector reason to suppose that the importer claimed the importation came under such paragraph by virtue of the similitude clause, and therefore was defective. In Re Guggenheim Smelting Co., 112 Fed. 517, 50 C. C. A. 374 (1901), the Circuit Court of Appeals held a protest sufficient to justify recovery which claimed classification under a \n\n[257 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n named paragraph, although the article imported could only be so classified by virtue of the similitude clause. In United States v. Dearberg, 135 Fed. 245, the same point arose in the Circuit Court, S. D., New York, and the board of general appraisers was sustained in holding the protest sufficient under the authority of the Guggenheim Case. 135 Fed. 245. This was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 143 Fed. 472, 74 C. C. A. 226 (1905) without opinion, on the authority of the Hahn Case. Thereafter the board of general appraisers, in this and others cases, has by a majority vote, followed the Hahn Case. In the case of United States v. Snellenburg, 9 Ct. Cust. App. 59, the Court of Customs Appeals held a protest sufficient which mentioned a special paragraph without more, although the article imported could only be brought under the paragraph by virtue of a similitude paragraph. The Court of Customs Appeals, in the judgment here under review, followed the Snellenburg Case and sustained the protest, one member of the court dissenting. It is because of this somewhat exceptional contrariety of opinion existing among general appraisers, Circuit Courts of Appeals and Judges of the Court of Customs Appeals, that this court has granted a certiorari herein.\n The protest and similitude clauses have appeared in all tariff acts since 1842 in substantially the same form as in paragraph N and paragraph 386 of the Tariff Act of 1913, so that the authorities construing other tarriff acts have application to the present question.\n A protest must be distinct and specific enough to show that the objection taken at the hearing or trial was at the time of filing the protest in the mind of the importer and sufficient to notify the collector of its true nature and character to the end that he might then ascertain the precise facts and have adequate opportunity to correct mistakes and cure defects.

Morgan, \n112 \nU.S. 495, 501\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 241; Arthur v. Dodge, \n101 U.S. 34\n, 37; Greely's Administrator v. Burgess, 18 How. 413, 416. But no special form is required.\n'A protest which indicates to an intelligent man the ground of the importer's objection to the duty levied upon the articles should not be discarded because of the brevity with which the objection is stated.' Schell's Executors v. Fauche, supra.\n\n'We are not, therefore, disposed to exact any nice precision, nor to apply any strict rule of construction upon the notices required under this statute. It is sufficient if the importer indicates distinctly and definitely the source of his complaint, and his design to make it the foundation for a claim against the government.' Greely's Adm'r v. Burgess, supra.\n\n Does a claim in a protest under a particular paragraph, with no more, adequately indicate to the collector that the importer intends to claim the article imported may come under the specified paragraph either directly, or by resemblance to articles therein described?\n In Arthur v. Fox, \n108 U.S. 125\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 371, this court said:\n'If an article is found not enumerated in the tariff laws, then the first inquiry is whether it 'bears a similitude, either in material, quality, texture or use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated ... as chargeable as with duty.' If it does, and the similitude is substantial, then, in the language of the court in Stuart v. Maxwell [16 How. 150], 'it is to be deemed the same, and to be charged accordingly.' In other words, although not specifically enumerated, it is provided for under the name of the article it most resembles.'\n\n The part of paragraph 386 under consideration prescribes a rule of construction applicable to every paragraph of the tariff, imposing duty on specifically described articles. It is a general provision intended to enlarge the scope of each paragraph to include articles not specifically described but resembling articles specified. The collector \n\n[257 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n must be taken to be familiar with the general provisions of the Tariff Act. When an importer specifies in his protest a paragraph under which he claims his importation should be classified, the collector should inquire not only whether the article comes within the paragraph named, but also whether it so resembles the articles specifically described therein as to require it to be classified thereunder. After satisfying himself that the article does not come within the specific description of the named paragraph, its resemblance to articles which do should be his 'first inquiry.'\n The quoted words of paragraph 386 mention no specific rate. Any reference to them in a protest would be meaningless, unless accompanied by mention of some taxing paragraph. It is the latter which taxes the article under the general rule of interpretation which these words furnish.\n It is said thereby that resemblance is a question of fact, but it is one not very different from that involved in the classification of articles within the specific description of the paragraph. The object of the protest is to put the collector on inquiry, not alone as to the law, but also as to the facts which make the law applicable. The reasoning of the Court of Customs Appeals meets our approval and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. MASON & HANGER CO(1922)\nNo. 121\nArgued: November 24, 1922Decided: December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n Mr. Geo. A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee. \n\n[260 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims which awards the appellee, plaintiff in the Court of Claims, the sum of $12,064.52, composed of three sums, which are respectively of the amounts of $2,500, $ 450, and $9,114.52. The last two sums the United States does not contest. The sum of $2,500 is only, therefore, in question. The amount is charged to be due (as the other sums were) upon what are called 'cost plus contracts' for the construction of certain buildings at Camp Zachary Taylor, near Louisville, Kentucky.\n It is provided in article II of the contract that 'the contractor shall be reimbursed ... for such of its actual net expenditures in the performance of said work as may be approved or ratified by the contracting officer. ... (h) Such bonds, fire, liability, and other insurance as the contracting officer may approve or require, and such losses and expenses, not compensated by insurance or otherwise, as are found and certified by the contracting officer to have been actually sustained (including settlements made with the written consent and approval of the contracting officer) by the contractor in connection with said work, and to have clearly resulted from causes other than the fault or neglect of the contractor. ...'\n The United States contends that within the meaning of article II the premium paid on a bond of $250,000 that being the amount fixed by the War Department, was not an expenditure in the performance of the work. The Court of Claims decided the contrary and supported its decision by the action and approval of the War Department. And there was no hesitation on the part of the department. It recognized the obligation of the government under the contract to pay to the contractor the \n\n[260 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n amount of premium, and negotiated with the surety companies for a reduction of it in the interest of the government. The premium was approved by the contracting officer as required by article II and paid as part of the cost of the work and was not questioned for over two years. Its amount was later deducted from other sums due the contractor.\n What is the import of this practical interpretation? The government does not contend that the words of the contract were dictated by statute. They are, therefore, the words of the contracting officer to express and provide for the purpose of the government in exercise of the duty with which he was charged, and used as a declaration and measure of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. His subsequent conduct is necessarily to be considered a definition of them. The officer in a sense is a party to the contract, not only representing but speaking for the impersonality of the government. Competent, therefore, it would seem, to declare the meaning of the contract.\n We are, however, not called upon to pass upon the conflicting contentions. The contract contains other provisions that determine the liability of the government.\n Article IV of the contract provides for a monthly statement of the elements of costs upon which, if there be disagreement, the decision of the contracting officer 'shall govern.' It is further provided that 'the settlement so made and all payments made thereon shall be final and binding upon both parties hereto, except as provided in article XIV hereof.' Article XIV requires the contract to be interpreted as a whole, not by any special clause and takes care to reserve the determining decision to the officers concerned with the work, the final decision being that of the Secretary of War. Article IV, indeed, is the complement and elaboration of the provision of article II (quoted above), which provides that the contractor is to \n\n[260 U.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n be reimbursed for such of its expenditures 'as may be approved or ratified by the contracting officer.'\n We have decided that the parties to the contract can so provide and that the decision of the officer is conclusive upon the parties. Kihlberg v. United States, \n97 U.S. 398\n; Martinsburg & Potomac Railroad Co. v. March, \n114 U.S. 549\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1035; United States v. Gleason, \n175 U.S. 588\n; 20 Sup. Ct. 228; Ripley v. United States, \n223 U.S. 695\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 352. This is extending the rule between private parties to the government.\n There were such decisions, and settlement, and payments, in consequence of them, as we have seen. Over the effect of these the Comptroller of the Treasury has no power. They were the acts and duty of the officer in charge in the expression of which there was no ambiguity, and were, therefore, conclusive in effect.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judgment affirmed on rehearing, \n261 U.S. 610\n, 43 Sup.

The statute prescribes the punishment to be--\n'a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in the workhouse of the District of Columbia at hard labor for not more than twelve months or by both such fine and imprisonment.' 34 Stat. 86.\n\n He was tried by a jury and found guilty, and, after certain proceedings with which we have no concern, he \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n was sentenced to the workhouse at hard labor for six months.\n The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the juvenile court, with directions to dismiss the complaint. The court considered that it was constrained to decide that the judgment was in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and, therefore, to reverse it on the authority of Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 U.S. 228\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 977.\n The United States resists both the authority and extent of that case by the citation of others, which, it asserts, modify or overrule it. A review of it, therefore, is of initial importance.\n Certain statutes of the United States made it unlawful under certain circumstances for a Chinese laborer to be in the United States, and provided for his deportation by certain officers, among others, a commissioner of a United States court. And one of them (Act of 1892 [Comp. St.  4318]) provided that, if a Chinese person or one of that descent was 'convicted and adjudged to be not lawfully entitled to be or remain in the United States,' he should 'be imprisoned at hard labor for a period not exceeding one year, and thereafter removed from the United States.'\n Wong Wing, a Chinese person (there were others arrested, but for the purpose of convenience of reference we treat the case as being against him only), was arrested and taken before a commissioner of the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and adjudged to be unlawfully within the United States and not entitled to remain therein. It was also adjudged that he be imprisoned at hard labor at and in the Detroit House of Correction for the period of 60 days.\n The court, considering the statutes, said they operated on two classes-one which came into the country with its consent; the other which came in without consent and in disregard of law-and that Congress had the constitutional \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n power to deport both classes and to commit the enforcement of the law to executive officers.\n This power of arrest by the executive officers and the power of deportation were sustained; but the punishment provided for by the act, and which was pronounced against Wong Wing, that is, imprisonment at hard labor, was decided to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment; he not having been proceeded against by presentment or indictment by a grand jury.\n The court noted the argument and the cases cited and sustained the power of exclusion, but said that when Congress went further, and inflicted punishment at hard labor, it 'must provide for a judicial trial to establish the guilt of the accused.' And this because such punishment was infamous and prohibited by the Fifth Amendment; the conditions prescribed by the amendment not having been observed. The necessity of their observance was decided, because, to repeat, imprisonment at hard labor was an infamous punishment. In sanction of the decision Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 428\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 935, was cited and quoted from. The citation was in point. Both propositions were presented in that case, and both were decided upon elaborate consideration and estimate of authorities. See, also, Mackin v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 348, 350\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 777.\n The United States urges against the Wong Wing Case that 4 years after its decision the question of the infamy attached to punishments came up for consideration and decision in Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n178 U.S. 304\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 944, and that it (the Wong Wing Case) was not referred to. The immediate answer is that a case is not overruled by an omission to mention it. Besides, it was based on Ex parte Wilson, and that case was cited. The Wilson case was elaborate in the exposition of the law-its evolution and extent. The various punishments, or, we may say, the various imprisonments, to which infamy had been ascribed, were detailed, with citation of cases. In these were in cluded, \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n as certain, imprisonment in a penitentiary. But it was decided that the quality of infamy could attach to any imprisonment, if accompanied by hard labor. It was said, and it was necessary to say, in passing on Wilson's situation, athat--\n'Imprisonment at hard labor, compulsory and unpaid, is, in the strongest sense of the words, 'involuntary servitude for crime,' spoken of in the provision of the Ordinance of 1787 and of the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, by which all other slavery was abolished.'\n\n In other words, it was declared that, if imprisonment was in any other place than a penitentiary and was to be at hard labor, the latter gave it character; that is, made it infamous and brought it within the prohibition of the Constitution.\n There is nothing in Fitzpatrick v. United States that gives aid to the contention, which counsel make, that it is the place of imprisonment- that is, imprisonment in a penitentiary-which makes the infamy; the accompaniment of hard labor being but an incident. It is true in that case it was said that 'the test is not the imprisonment which is imposed, but that which may be imposed under the statute.' This manifestly was said to distinguish the character of the crime as capital, and not to assign a quality to the punishment. To assign a quality to the punishment was a necessity in Wong Wing v. United States and in Ex parte Wilson, and it was responded to by discussions pertinent to it, and by decisions which were required by it. We can add nothing to the fullness of the discussions or their adequacy, and the decisions pronounced as their consequence we are not disposed to overrule. They necessarily determine, therefore, the present case, and require the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, so far as it decides that the sentence upon Moreland was void because of the inclusion therein of the punishment of hard labor; he not having been presented or indicted by a grand jury. And because of their authority we do not review the cases cited by the United States, nor consider that they can be modified in \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n accommodation to the practice that is said to exist of creating workhouses as places of punishment.\n Some further comment becomes necessary. An attempt is made to modify the case or to remove it as authority for that at bar. The means and pains taken to accomplish it are somewhat baffling to representation. We have cited the case for the proposition that imprisonment with the accompaniment of hard labor is an infamous punishment, made so by the accompaniment of hard labor, and declared illegal because not upon presentment or indictment by a grand jury.\n Doubt is cast upon our right to so cite it, and it is, in effect, asserted that the infamy of the imprisonment to which Wong Wing was sentenced was not constituted by the accompaniment of hard labor, but was the attribute of the imprisonment; the Detroit House of Correction being, it is said, a penitentiary. And this is attempted to be established by the assertion of a fact extraneous to the opinion of the court and the record in the cause. It is true certain isolated sentences used by a justice concurring in part and dissenting in part are referred to as to what the court must have implied.\n The assertion calls for reply. We have relied on the case as authority, and, regarding it as authority, we have naturally refrained from the idleness, or, as it may be said, the ostentation, of general reasoning. We might, indeed, leave the case to speak for itself to those who may need to refer to its ruling and the ruling in the present case; but some comment, though it may not be necessary, is justified.\n It is to be kept in mind that the case concerned the Constitution of the United States and necessarily had a purpose beyond its incident and time. Its precept became a part of the Constitution, and in realization of this the court took care that the grounds of its decisions were neither obscure nor uncertain. Its opinion demonstrates this, and that there was no misunderstanding of the points \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n of counsel nor ambiguity in passing upon them. What was not in controversy, of course, received no attention, and the infamy of imprisonment in a penitentiary was not in controversy; that was of universal acceptance then, as now, and an intimation of its existence would have been enough to have caused Wong Wing's delivery from custody on the instant; nor would the United States have resisted. There was in controversy, however, the question whether imprisonment in any prison or place, at hard labor, as a sentence for crime, was infamous. Upon that counsel were in opposition, and it was submitted for decision. The court contrasted the contentions.\n Wong Wing's was recognized as a claim that his sentence to imprisonment at hard labor inflicted an infamous punishment, and hence conflicted with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, he not having been presented or indicted by a grand jury.\n'On the other hand,' the court said, 'it is contended by the government that it has never been decided by this court that in all cases where the punishment may be confinement at hard labor, the crime is infamous, and many cases are cited from the reports of the state Supreme Courts, where the constitutionality of statutes providing for summary proceedings, without a jury trial, for the punishment by imprisonment at hard labor of vagrants and disorderly persons has been upheld.\n\n The comment was an anticipation of some things that are urged in this case. At any rate, the contrast of contentions shows unmistakably upon what the court's decision was invoked,1 and while it decided, as we have seen, \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n that the commissioner had power under the Act of 1892 to order Wong Wing deported and to sentence him to imprisonment, Congress could not legally invest the commissioner with power to make hard labor an adjunct of the imprisonment. It was, in effect, said that the adjunct made the imprisonment infamous, and beyond the power of legislation to direct, without making provision 'for a judicial trial to establish the guilt of the accused.' Wong Wing was therefore discharged from custody.\n That the place of imprisonment was not considered either pertinent or determinative is established by the fact that the Detroit House of Correction was not a penitentiary, nor regarded as such. It was, and is, what its name implies-a place of correction and reformation, not of condemnation to infamy, and it might be to a perpetual criminal career. Howell's Mich. Stats. Anno. (2d Ed.) c. 430, p. 5915 et seq.; Acts Mich. 1861, p. 262, Act. No. 164; Compiled Laws of Mich. 1897,  2155\n\n\n It is an institution of the city of Detroit, and the act creating it designated its use to be 'for the confinement, punishment and reformation of criminals or persons sentenced thereto. ...' How this use is regulated and its purpose accomplished are detailed in too much legislation to be reproduced. The House of Correction stands in a unique relation to the state prison, and while it may, under circumstances and in the discretion of a condemning court, be a place of imprisonment for offenders that might be committed to the state prison, yet always it is kept distinct from the state prison. It does not, therefore, make its use as a place of confinement for other offenses a penitentiary, with its attachment of infamy. Its purpose is reformation, instruction in conduct, and diversion from a criminal career. To make it, therefore, a penitentiary, would defeat the purpose of its creation.\n We have dwelt on this matter at length because we think more is involved than the power to deport aliens, or \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n to punish them for illegal entry into the country-more than to deliver one from punishment who has defied the orders of a court, that enjoined upon him the manifest duty of supporting his minor children. It concerns the recognition and enforcement of a provision of the Constitution of the United States expressing and securing an important right. And the right, at times, must be accorded one whose conduct tempts to a straining of the law against him.\n The ultimate contention of the United States is that the provision of the Act of March 23, 1906, for punishment by fine or imprisonment are severable, and that, therefore, it was error in the Court of Appeals in holding the act unconstitutional, and in directing the dismissal of the case, instead of sending it back for further proceedings.\n The contention is untenable. It is what sentence can be imposed under the law, not what was imposed, that is the material consideration. When an accused is in danger of an infamous punishment, if convicted, he has a right to insist that he be not put upon trial, except on the accusation of a grand jury. Ex parte Wilson and Mackin v. United States, supra.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom concurs Mr. Chief Justice TAFT and Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n On January 18, 1921, an information, under the Act of March 23, 1906, c. 1131, 34 Stat. 86, was filed against Moreland in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia for willfully neglecting to provide support for his minor children-girls aged 8 and 13. He was tried by a jury and found guilty. The court suspended sentence and ordered him to pay each month for their \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n support the sum of $30. Having failed to make any payment under this order, Moreland was sentenced on April 19, 1921, to be committed to the workhouse at hard labor for 6 months; the superintendent to pay to the mother for the support of the children 50 cents for each day's hard labor performed by him. Moreland had insisted that the offense with which he had been charged was an infamous crime, since the statute prescribes as punishment imprisonment at hard labor, and he claimed that rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment had been violated, because he had been made to answer to the charge without having been indicted by the grand jury. His claim was overruled by the juvenile court. Upon writ of error the Court of Appeals of the District (51 App. D. C. 118, 276 Fed. 640), relying upon Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 U.S. 228\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 977, reversed the judgment of the juvenile court and directed that the complaint be dismissed. The case came here on writ of certiorari. \n257 U.S. 631\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 169, 66 L. Ed. --.\n The Fifth Amendment declares:\n'No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury . ...'\n\n Whether a crime is infamous, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, may be determined by the character of the punishment or by other incidents of the sentence prescribed. Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 426\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 935. In the Wong Wing Case the commitment was to an institution which was named the Detroit House of Correction, but served also as a state prison or penitentiary. \n2\n Imprisonment \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n in a state penitentiary is an infamous punishment whether it be with or without hard labor. In re Claasen, \n140 \nU.S. 200, 205\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 735. Moreover, the commitment in the Wong Wing Case was not under sentence of a court or after conviction by a jury. It was by direction of a commissioner of the United States. The punishment by imprisonment was thus imposed under an executive order, and, hence, was clearly void under the Constitution, whatever its character or incidents, its duration or the place of confinement. The question here involved is different. It is whether the mere fact that the act prescribes hard labor as an incident of the sentence of confinement in the workhouse, renders the offense (which the statute describes as a misdemeanor) an infamous crime within the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment.\n The Act of March 23, 1906, declares that any person in the District of Columbia, who shall willfully neglect to provide for his minor children under the age of 16 in destitute circumstances, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in the workhouse of the District at hard labor for not more than 12 months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. If a fine is imposed, the court may direct that it be paid \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 444]\n\u00a0\n to the wife or other person in whose care the children are. If the father is confined to the workhouse, the superintendent is required to pay toward their support a sum equal to 50 cents for each day's hard labor performed by him. Either before trial or after conviction the father may be released upon giving recognizance for the payment of a weekly allowance for the support of the children. These provisions may be enforced by proceedings in the juvenile court (Act of June 18, 1912, c. 171,  8, 37 Stat. 134, 136), and, if so, they are commenced by information. The accused is entitled to trial by jury, as the pensalty which may be imposed for the offense charged is a fine of more than $50 or imprisonment for more than 30 days. Act of March 19, 1906, c. 960,  12, 34 Stat. 73, 75.\n The workhouse of the District of Columbia is at Occoquan in the state of Virginia. It is an industrial farm of 1150 acres, bordering on the Occoquan river. On the farm, in healthful and attractive surroundings, are many small, well-equipped buildings, appropriate for the residence and occupation of the inmates. These are employed on the premises, partly in agricultural, partly in industrial, pursuits-in cultivating hundreds of acres of land and in clearing, from time to time, more; in fruit orchards and dairy; in chicken and hog raising; in brick-manufacturing and stone- crushing plants; in sawmill operations and a small shipyard; in the repair and construction of farm implements, of roads, and of buildings required for the development of the institution; and in transporting its products by water or otherwise. The work is such as is ordinarily performed under favorable conditions on farms, in factories, and in the mechanical trades; and it is not harder. The eight-hour workday prevails. There is a school, a library, and a hospital. And there is no wall, cell, lock, or bar to restrain the inmates. Nor are they subjected to a distinctive dress such \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 445]\n\u00a0\n as marks offenders. \n3\n By section 934 of the Code of the District, persons sentenced by its courts to imprisonment for not more than 6 months may ordinarily be committed either to the workhouse or to the jail; if sentenced for more than 6 months and not more than 1 year, the commitment must be to the jail; if sentenced for more than 1 year, the commitment must be to a penitentiary. The dominant purpose of Occoquan is not punishment, but rehabilitation. The compulsory labor is in a larger sense compulsory education. In the case of those who are committed for nonsupport, it serves also the purpose of compelling the performance of a parental duty imposed by the common law. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Confinement at hard labor in a workhouse or house of correction for periods of less than a year was a punishment commonly imposed in America in the colonial period, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and since, for offenses not deemed serious-that is, for delinquencies, as distinguished from serious crimes. Thus by the Great Law of the Province of Pennsylvania of December 7, 1682, the penalty for clamorous scolding, railing or lying was 3 days' imprisonment in the house of correction at hard labor; for cursing, playing at cards or dice, and for the first offense of drunkenness, it was 5; for stage plays, bull baiting, and cock fighting, it was at least 10; and for dueling it was 3 months. The duty to establish such a house 'for restraint, correction, labour and punishment' was imposed upon every county of Pennsylvania at the same time. \n5\n A similar \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 446]\n\u00a0\n law had been enacted in Plymouth colony in 1658;6 in Massachusetts colony earlier;7 and like provision was made in other colonies. \n8\n By the Law of New York of February 9, 1788, c. 31, confinement in the house of correction at hard labor was prescribed as the punishment for all disorderly persons, and those 'who threaten to run away and leave their wives and children to the city or town' were classed as disorderly persons, with vagrants, beggars, idlers, fortune tellers and common prostitutes. The period of imprisonment, limited ordinarily to 60 days or until the next general sessions of the peace, could be extended by the general sessions for a further period of 6 months. In the counties or cities in which there was no workhouse (bridewell) or house of correction, the jails were to be used and considered as such. \n9\n A single institution often served as almshouse, insane asylum, workhouse, house of correction and jail. \n10\n And under all of these laws commitment to the workhouse at hard labor was made by a judge, justice of the peace, or magistrate, without presentment or indictment of a grand jury. \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 447]\n\u00a0\n Confinement at hard labor in workhouse or house of correction did not imply infamy. Workhouses were not open to the reception of felons. Besides being refuges, they were in purpose correctional institutions in a true sense of those words. They were deemed training schools, in which bad habits were to be eradicated and good ones formed. The medium of instruction adopted was regular, hard, productive work. The labor which inmates were required to perform was not imposed as punishment or as a means of disgrace. Nor was the confinement imposed primarily as punishment. That was administered rather by the whipping 'not exceeding ten stripes' to which by some laws the newcomer was subjected on entering the institution. \n11\n The proceeds of the labor were deemed, in large part, payment for maintenance. But often part of the earnings were reserved for the inmate or were ordered to be paid for the support of his family. \n12\n It thus appears that the willful neglect to provide for wife and children in destitute circumstances for which Congress sought to provide relief in 1906 was not a new social manifestation and that the method employed by it was not novel. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n It is not the provision for hard labor, but the imprisonment in a penitentiary, which now renders a crime in famous. \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 448]\n\u00a0\n Commitment to a penitentiary, with or without hard labor, connotes infamy, because it is proof of the conviction of a crime of such a nature that infamy was a prescribed consequence. Con finement in a penitentiary is the modern substitute for the death penalty and for the other forms of corporal punishment which, at the time of the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, were still administered in America for most of the crimes deemed serious. \n14\n It was then believed that even capital punishment should be inflicted under conditions involving public disgrace. Largely for this reason hangings were public, as in earlier days men had been drawn and quartered. If the life of an offender was spared, it was then thought that some other punishment involving disgrace must be applied to render his loss of reputation permanent. When in 1786 Pennsylvania, shrinking from the physical cruelties inflicted under sentence of the courts, took the first step in reform by substituting imprisonment for death as the penalty for some of the lesser felonies, the exposure to infamy was still deemed an essential of punishment. The measure then enacted provided specifically that the imprisonment should be attended by 'continuous hard labor publicly and disgracefully imposed.' Hard labor as thus prescribed and prac ticed \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 449]\n\u00a0\n was merely an instrument of disgrace. The statutory direction was carried out by employing the convicts in gang labor along the public roads, chained by fetters with bomb shells attached and iron collars, with shaved heads, and wearing a distinctive infamous dress. \n15\n The demoralizing influence both upon the community and the convict of these public manifestations of disgrace was soon realized, and led, shortly after the adoption of our Constitution, to their discontinuance in Pennsylvania and to the establishment in Philadelphia of America's first penitentiary. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Hard labor was not considered an essential element of the penitentiary punishment; and experience proved that it was in fact an alleviation. The most severe punishment inflicted was solitary confinement without labor. \n17\n Hard labor regularly pursued and productively employed had for two centuries been applied as a corrective measure in the effort to deal with social delinquents. \n18\n Then the belief spread that it might be effectively employed also in the reformation of criminals-a class of persons theretofore generally considered incorrigible. And when reform and rehabilitation of those convicted of serious crimes became a chief aim of the penal system, the dignity of labor was proclaimed and the practices of the workhouse \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 450]\n\u00a0\n were adopted and developed in the penitentiary. \n19\n Thus hard labor, which, in inflicting punishment for serious crimes, had first been introduced as a medium of disgrace, became the means of restoring and giving self- respect.\n The purpose of the Fifth Amendment was stated by Chief Justice Shaw in Jones v. Robbins, 8 Gray (Mass.) 329, 347-349; and his statement was quoted with approval by this court in Ex parte Wilson, supra, \n114 U.S. 428\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 941. It was 'to make a marked distinction between crimes of great magnitude and atrocity, and to secure every person against accusation and trial for them without the previous interposition of a grand jury,' but 'to leave minor and petty offences to be prosecuted without these formalities.' Imprisonment in a penitentiary where the convict is (or used to be) 'subject to solitary imprisonment, to have his hair cropped, to be clothed in conspicuous prison dress, subjected to hard labor without pay, to hard fare, coarse and meager food, and to severe discipline' is a punishment deemed infamous; but commitment to a 'house of correction, under that and the various names of workhouse or bridewell,' although some of the incidents of the confinement are identical, 'has not the same character of infamy attached to it.' There is thus no basis for the contention that sentence to hard labor as an incident of confinement necessarily renders a punishment infamous, or that commitment to a workhouse at hard labor can be made only upon indictment by a grand jury. This court did not hold in Wong Wing v. United States, nor has it, heretofore, ever decided or stated, that commitment to a workhouse at hard labor is an infamous punishment. The confinement in the Wong Wing Case was in an institution used as a \n\n[258 U.S. 433, 451]\n\u00a0\n state prison or penitentiary and the expression in the opinion concerning imprisonment at hard labor must be understood as referring to such.\n But even if imprisonment at hard labor elsewhere than in a penitentiary had, in the past, been deemed an infamous punishment, it would not follow that confinement, or rather service, at a workhouse like Occoquan, under the conditions now prevailing should be deemed so. As stated in Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 427\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 935 (29 L. Ed. 89), and in Mackin v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 348, 351\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 777, 778 (29 L. Ed. 909):\n'What punishments shall be considered as infamous may be affected by the changes of public opinion from one age to another.'\n\n Such changes may result from change in the conditions in which, or in the purpose for which, a punishment is prescribed. The Constitution contains no reference to hard labor. The prohibition contained in the Fifth Amendment refers to infamous crimes-a term obviously inviting interpretation in harmony with conditions and opinion prevailing from time to time. And to-day commitment to Occoquan for a short term for nonsupport of minor children is certainly not an infamous punishment. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We may quote, in corroboration, that even the concurring justice said the question involved was whether a Chinese person could 'be lawfully convicted and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for a definite period by a commissioner without indictment or trial by jury.' The italics are the justice's and we copy their emphasis, as it demonstrates that the fact of hard labor was that which determined the case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It seems clear that the court had this fact in mind. In his concurring opinion Mr. Justice Field said (\n163 U.S. 241\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 982): 'It does not follow that, because the government may expel aliens or exclude them from coming to this country, it can confine them at hard labor in a penitentiary before deportation or subject them to any harsh and oruel punishment.' In Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 428\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 935, 940 (29 L. Ed. 89) strongly relied upon by the court in \n163 \nU.S. 234, 237\n, 242 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 977, Mr. Justice Gray said: 'For more than a century, imprisonment at hard labor in the state prison or penitentiary or other similar institution has been considered an infamous punishment in England and America.' In the Wilson Case the prisoner had been sentenced to the Detroit House of Correction for the term of 15 years for having passed counterfeit bonds. In 1892, when Wong Wing was sentenced, there were about 1,700 United States prisoners, other than those serving jail sentences, who were confined in about 60 state and territorial institutions. The institution having the largest number, 432 on July 1, 1892, was the Detroit House of Correction, these prisoners having been received from various districts in the South and West, as well as from the Michingan districts.

The punishment, other than death, then prescribed for serious crimes were mutilation, cutting off the ears or nailing them to the pillory, branding, whipping, the pillory, the stocks and the ducking stool.

St.  1704). Defendants in error were indicted for a violation of the Narcotic Act of December 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 785, 786 (Comp. St.  6287g-6287q). The indictment charged them with unlawfully selling to another a certain amount of a derivative of opium and a certain amount of a derivative of coca leaves, not in pursuance of any written order on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, contrary to the provisions of section 2 of the act. (Comp. St.  6287h). The defendants demurred to the indictment on the ground that it failed to charge that they had sold the inhibited drugs knowing them to be such. The statute does not make such knowledge an element of the offense. The District Court sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment. The correctness of this ruling is the question before us.\n While the general rule at common law was that the scienter was a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this was followed in regard to statutory crimes even where the statutory definition did \n\n[258 U.S. 250, 252]\n\u00a0\n not in terms include it (Rex v. Sleep, 8 Cox, 472), there has been a modification of this view in respect to prosecutions under statutes the purpose of which would be obstructed by such a requirement. It is a question of legislative intent to be construed by the court. It has been objected that punishment of a person for an act in violation of law when ignorant of the facts making it so, is an absence of due process of law. But that objection is considered and overruled in Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v. Minnesota, \n218 \nU.S. 57, 69\n, 70 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 663, 666 (54 L. Ed. 930), in which it was held that in the prohibition or punishment of particular acts, the state may in the maintenance of a public policy provide 'that he who shall do them shall do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance.' Many instances of this are to be found in regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases of mala in se. Commonwealth v. Mixer, 207 Mass. 141, 93 N. E. 249, 31 L. R. A . (N. S.) 467, 20 Ann. Cas. 1152; Commonwealth v. Smith, 166 Mass. 370, 44 N. E. 503; Commonwealth v. Hallett, 103 Mass. 452; People v.

So, too, in the collection of taxes, the importance to the public of their collection leads the Legislature to impose on the taxpayer the burden of finding out the facts upon which his liability to pay depends and meeting it at the peril of punishment. Regina v. Woodrow, 15 M. & W. 404; Bruhn v. Rex, \n\n[258 U.S. 250, 1909]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 317. Again where one deals with others and his mere negligence may be dangerous to them, as in selling diseased food or poison, the \n\n[258 U.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n policy of the law may, in order to stimulate proper care, require the punishment of the negligent person though he be ignorant of the noxious character of what he sells. Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation (1910) 2 K. B. Div. 471, 483.\n The question before us, therefore, is one of the construction of the statute and of inference of the intent of Congress. The Narcotic Act has been held by this court to be a taxing act with the incidental purpose of minimizing the spread of addiction to the use of poisonous and demoralizing drugs. United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 94\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 214; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854.\n Section 2 of the Narcotic Act (38 Stat. 786) we give in part in the margin. \n1\n It is very evident from a reading of \n\n[258 U.S. 250, 254]\n\u00a0\n it that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic. Its manifest purpose is to require every person dealing in drugs to ascertain at his peril whether that which he sells comes within the inhibition of the statute, and if he sells the inhibited drug in ignorance of its character, to penalize him. Congress weighed the possible injustice of subjecting an innocent seller to a penalty against the evil of exposing innocent purchasers to danger from the drug, and concluded that the latter was the result preferably to be avoided. Donbtless considerations as to the opportunity of the seller to find out the fact and the difficulty of proof of knowledge contributed to this conclusion. We think the demurrer to the indictment should have been overruled.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in this decision. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Part of section 2 of an act entitled 'An act to provide for the registration of, with collectors of internal revenue, and to impose a special tax upon all persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away opium or coca leaves, their salts, derivatives, or preparations, and for other purposes,' approved December 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 785, 786:\n'Sec. 2.

The charge of the petition is that the defendants restrain or attempt to monopolize, and do monopolize trade and commerce in violation of the Act of July 2, 1890, known as the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), and have also violated the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489. The prayer of the petition is that the lines of the Southern Pacific Company and those of the Central Pacific Railway Company be decreed to constitute competitive systems, and that the ownership acquired by the Southern Pacific Company of all or a controlling interest in the capital stock of the Central Pacific Railway Company, and its lease, control and operation of the lines thereof be declared violative of the Sherman Act; that the Southern Pacific Company be required to dispose of such capital stock, and cancel and relinquish its lease, control, management, and operation thereof; and that the control of the Central Pacific Railway Company by the Southern Pacific be decreed to be in violation of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1862, entitled 'An act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,' and also violative of the act, supplemental to the act of 1862, the Act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 356, and the Act of June 20, 1874, 18 Stat. 111 (Comp. St.  10057); the government miantaining that the effect of such acts is to require the Central Pacific to maintain physical connection with the Union Pacific to make a through line to the coast, and to furnish equal advantages and facilities as to rates, time, and transportation over such through line.\n An answer was filed by the defendants, much testimony was taken, and a decree was entered dismissing the petition, \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 226]\n\u00a0\n one of the three Circuit Judges who heard the case dissenting. 239 Fed. 998.\n The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California was incorporated under the laws of California in 1891 for the purposes of constructing a railroad from Sacramento to the eastern boundary of California. In 1862 and 1864 Congress by proper legislation incorporated the Union Pacific Railroad Company to build from the Missouri river westward, and authorized the Central Pacific to build eastwardly from the Pacific Coast, at or near San Francisco, to a common meeting point with the Union Pacific. These acts of Congress authorized the issue of first mortgage bonds, and also second mortgage bonds, and made a land grant of public lands for each linear mile of railroad construction. These acts provided that these two railroads should be operated as one continuous line, and that neither should discriminate in favor of or against the other. Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, C. P. Huntington, and Mark Hopkins acquired a large part of the capital stock of the Central Pacific Company. The Central Pacific assigned to the Western Pacific a portion of the construction, namely, that from Sacramento to San Jose, this with the approval of Congress. Chapter 88,  2, 13 Stat. 504.\n The Pacific Railroads were constructed from 1864 to 1869 from the Missouri river to the Pacific Coast-from Omaha to Ogden, by the Union Pacific; from Ogden to Sacramento, by the Central Pacific; from Sacramento to San Jose, by the Western Pacific, afterwards consolidated with the Central Pacific. These are denominated in the defendants' brief as the 'bond-aided lines.' What they call the nonbond-aided lines of the Central Pacific system are those from Niles to Oakland, from Lathrop to Goshen, and from Roseville to Redding, which were constructed in the state of California from the years 1869 to 1872. In 1870 the Central Pacific absorbed in consolidation \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 227]\n\u00a0\n the Western Pacific, which built from Sacramento to San Jose; the Alameda Company, which built from Niles to Oakland; the San Joaquin, which built from Lathrop to Goshen; and the California & Oregon Company, which built from Roseville north en route to the Oregon line.\n The Southern Pacific Railroad Company was incorporated in 1865 under the laws of California for the purpose of constructing a railroad from San Francisco Bay, by the way of San Diego, to the eastern boundary of California. In 1866 Congress passed an act to incorporate the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company to construct a railroad near the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude from Springfield, Mo., to the Pacific Ocean. This act authorized the Southern Pacific to connect with the Atlantic & Pacific near the eastern boundary of California, and both companies were granted public lands. In 1867 the Southern Pacific changed its route to the eastward, so as not to go as far south as originally contemplated, this act was ratified by Congress and the Legislature of California in 1870\n\n\n In 1871 Congress incorporated the Texas Pacific Railroad Company to build a line of railroad near the thirty-second parallel of latitude from Marshall, Tex., by the way of El Paso, to the Pacific Ocean at San Diego, and to connect on the east with other railroads, and on the west with the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Southern Pacific was authorized to construct a railroad from Tehachapi Pass to a junction of the Texas Pacific Railroad at the eastern boundary of California. Land grants were made to both companies. In 1872 the Central Pacific had extended its lines to Goshen.\n About 1870 the promoters of the Central Pacific obtained control of the Southern Pacific, and subsequently the latter was constructed from Goshen through Tehachapi Pass, with one fork to a junction with the Atlantic & Pacific at The Needles (near thirty-fifth parallel) on the Colorado river at the eastern boundary of the state, and the \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 228]\n\u00a0\n other fork to the southeastern corner of the state (near thirty-second parallel), thence across Arizona and New Mexico to a junction in Texas with the Texas & Pacific, thence to a connection at El Paso with the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railroad. The sections of the Southern line were leased for a series of years to the Central. In 1881 the Southern Pacific made a junction with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe at Demming, N. M. In 1882 the Southern made a junction with the Texas & Pacific at Sierra Blanca, Tex. In 1883 the direct line of the southern connection with the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio and its eastern connections was completed through to New Orleans. The same year it made its junction with the Atlantic & Pacific at The Needles.\n The section from Mohave to Needles was leased to the Santa Fe in 1883, and sold to it in 1911. From 1883 to 1885 the Central Pacific was the lessee owner of a system of leases, and the system was known as the 'Central Pacific Railroad and Leased Lines.' In February, 1885, after the formation of the Southern Pacific Company (of Kentucky), that road became the lessee. We shall have occasion to deal more particularly with that lease later.\n Without familiarity with the geography of the region described and the location of the points named, this description means little. The outstanding facts, and those essential to be considered in the view which we take of this branch of the case, are: The Central Pacific Railroad extends from the Bay of San Francisco to Ogden, Utah, with a branch extending north from Roseville, in Central California, to the northern boundary of California; and to Kirk, in Oregon, and a branch extending south from Lathrop, in Central California, to Goshen, Cal., and a branch extending south from Hazen, in Nevada, to Mojave, in California, and a branch from Fernley in Nevada, to Susanville, Cal., and a short line in Oregon from Oakridge to Natron. At Ogden the Central Pacific connects \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 229]\n\u00a0\n with the Union Pacific, extending to Omaha, Neb., and to Kansas City, Mo., connecting at Ogden with the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, and with other connecting roads eastwardly to the Missouri river, and from the Missouri river to the central and eastern parts of the United States.\n The Southern Pacific system extends from San Francisco Bay, by way of El Paso, to Galveston, Tex., and to New Orleans, there connecting with steamship lines to New York City controlled by the Southern Pacific. At El Paso it connects with the Rock Island, which runs to Omaha and Chicago; at New Orleans it connects with roads extending to points in the central and eastern parts of the United States. It owns branches in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and many in California.\n The Central Pacific with its eastern connection at Ogden forms one great system of transportation between the East and the West, and the Southern Pacific with its roads and connections, and steamboat lines, forms another great transcontinental system for transportation from coast to coast. The Central Pacific constitutes some 800 miles of the transcontinental line of which it is a part. The Southern Pacific system has practically its own line of railroads and steamboat connections to New York, via Galveston and New Orleans.\n Under principles settled in the Union Pacific Case, \n226 \nU.S. 61, 86\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 53, the acquisition by the Southern Pacific Company of the stock of the Central Pacific Railway Company in 1899, unless justified by the special circumstances relied upon, to be hereinafter considered, constituted a combination in restraint of trade because it fetters the free and normal flow of competition in interstate traffic and tends to monopolization. In the Union Pacific Case this court held that the acquisition by the Union Pacific, which constituted about 1, 000 miles of the transcontinental system, to which we have referred, of enough stock in the Southern \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 230]\n\u00a0\n Pacific to dominate and control it, was violative of the Sherman Act. This case differs from that not at all in principle. These two great systems are normally competitive for the carrying trade in some parts from the East and Middle West to the Coast, and for the traffic moving to and from Central and Northern California, including a great volume of ocean-borne traffic which lands on the coast destined across the continent to the Atlantic Seaboard and intermediate Western and Eastern points, or is destined from the latter points to foreign ports via San Francisco or other Pacific Coast points.\n Counsel for the defendants, evidently realizing this situation, make elaborate argument to distinguish the Union Pacific Case. The claim is made that the decision there rested only on the fact that a then existing competition was restrained through the purchase by the Union Pacific of the control of the Southern Pacific in 1901; but the principle of that decision and of the previous cases upon which it rested was broader than the mere effect upon existing competition between the two systems.\n Such combinations, not the result of normal and natural growth and development, but springing from the formation of holding companies, or stock purchases, resulting in the unified control of different roads or systems, naturally competitive, constitute 'a menace and a restraint upon that freedom of commerce which Congress intended to recognize and protect and which the public is entitled to have protected.' Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 327\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 436, 453 (48 L. Ed. 679). This principle was restated and applied in United States v. Union Pacific Co., supra. It was reiterated and approved by the court as recently as the October term, 1919. United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26, 57\n, 58 S., 59, 40 Sup. Ct. 425.\n These cases, collectively, establish that one system of railroad transportation cannot acquire another, nor a substantial and vital part thereof, when the effect of such \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 231]\n\u00a0\n acquisition is to suppress, or materially reduce the free and normal flow of competition in the channels of interstate trade.\n In the instant case we are not dealing with the principle in the abstract. The proof is ample that the policy of the Southern Pacific system has been to favor transportation on its line by securing for itself, whenever practicable, the carriage of freight which would normally move eastward or westward over the shorter line of the Central Pacific Railroad and its connections, for its own much longer and wholly owned southern route. This course was limited by an arbitrary rule during the time the Union Pacific dominated the Southern Pacific from the stock purchase in 1901 until the so-called 'unmerger' in 1913, as a result of the decision of this court in the Union Pacific Case. The compelling motive of this course of conduct is obvious. The Southern Pacific owns and controls the southerly route, and receives 100 per cent. of the compensation for freight transported by its road and water lines. Over the Central Pacific route it receives but a fraction of the freight, because the Union Pacific with its Eastern connections take up the carrying from Ogden to the East. Self-interest dictates the solicitation and procurement of freight for the longer haul by the Southern Pacific lines. While many practices, formerly in vogue, are eliminated by the legislation of Congress regulating interstate commerce, and through rates and transportation may be had under public supervision, there are elements of competition in the granting of special facilities, the prompt carrying and delivery of freight, the ready and agreeable adjustment and settlement of claims, and other elements which that legislation does not control.\n It is conceded in the brief of counsel for the defendants that 'it is true of all such systems that, other things being equal, freight is preferentially solicited for the 100 per cent. haul.' \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 232]\n\u00a0\n We reach the conclusion that the stock ownership in the Central Pacific acquired by the Southern Pacific is violative of the Sherman Act within the principles settled by this court, certainly since the decision in the Northern Securities Case, in 1903, and that such stock ownership must be divested from the Southern Pacific Company unless the special circumstanses and defenses set up and relied upon by the defendants are to prevail.\n In the opinion of the majority of the judges sitting in the District Court it was set forth that these companies, the Southern Pacific and the Central Pacific, constituted practically a single system of railroads. This was held to be particularly true of so much of the systems as are in California and Oregon. It was said that the roads of the Central Pacific System appear on the map as natural links and parts of the Southern Pacific System, and that the spurs, branches, and tributary feeders of the Central Pacific belong to the Southern Pacific. It was maintained that the construction and control of these systems had substantially united them before the acts complained of which are alleged to be violative of the Sherman Act. True, the Central Pacific was incorporated by, and for a portion of the time under consideration its stock was owned by. Messrs. Stanford, Hopkins, Huntington, and Crocker. Perhaps as early as 1870 the same group gained control of anc continued to dominate the policy of the Southern Pacific. The roads were always separate and distinct corporations; they were so recognized in the acts of Congress making land grants to them, authorizing their construction and operation from one state or territory to another, and otherwise conferring rights on them which only Congress could confer. For a good part of the time the roads had boards of directors not consisting of the same persons. At times the majority of the stock was separately held. In the Central Pacific when the lease of 1885 to the Southern Pacific was made only one-fourth \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 233]\n\u00a0\n of the stock was held by the group to which we have referred. It had been sold and was widely owned in the United States and Europe. The dominating control was maintained from the fact that the stock had not been transferred by its true owners on the company's books, and much of it was held in the name of employees who were used in voting it by the original promoters, their successors and survivors.\n We cannot accept the theory of prior practical consolidation as a justification for a violation of the Sherman Act resulting from the stock control acquired in 1899.\n Much stress is placed on the lease in February, 1885, of the Central Pacific to the Southern Pacific for a term of 99 years. In 1884 the Southern Pacific, a holding company, was organized as a corporation of the state of Kentucky. The organization of this company which acquired the stocks of the Southern Pacific System, and became the lessee of the Central Pacific, was the result of a meeting in New York of Messrs. Stanford, Huntington, Crocker, and Timothy Hopkins, the successor of Mark Hopkins. The plan was then discussed, and the necessary measures directed to carry it into execution.\n The lease of 1885 is set up in the answer and relied upon as showing an existing legal acquisition before the transfer of the Central Pacific stock in 1899. This lease made February 17, 1885, was modified in January, 1888, and on December 7, 1893, a lease was entered into which recited that the agreements of lease between the same parties, the Southern Pacific and the Central Pacific, dated February 17, 1885, and January 1, 1888, respectively should be canceled, except in so far as they relate to the operation of the demised premises prior to January 1, 1894, and to the adjustment of accounts in respect to such operation.\n It is contended by the government that this lease in itself constituted a combination in restraint of interstate \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 234]\n\u00a0\n commerce. However this may be, this court has repeatedly recognized the fact that the Central Pacific was a corporation receiving much of its authroity and power from acts of Congress. California v. Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 U.S. 1\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1073. In Central Pacific Railroad Co. v. California, \n162 U.S. 91\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 766, it was held by this court that on the return for taxation by the Central Pacific Railroad Company of the value of its franchise and roadway, roadbed, and rails within the state of California, the same might be taxed under the laws of that state. This conclusion was reached against the elaborately stated and strongly expressed dissents of Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Justice Harlan. In the prevailing opinion, delivered by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, it was recognized (162 U. S. page 123, 16 Sup. Ct. 766) that important franchises conferred upon the Central Pacific were of federal creation, including that of constructing a railroad from the Pacific Ocean to Ogden in the then territory of Utah.\n It is true, as is argued at length by counsel for the defendants, that Congress had opportunity by the reports of its committees, and otherwise, to learn of this lease; but we are referred to no legislation passed by Congress authorizing or approving of it. In our view the lease for 99 years by the Central Pacific to a rival and competitive company could not legally be made without authorization by federal legislation. In the absence of such action the Central Pacific had not the corporate capacity to make the lease. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. et al. v.

It is stated and the previous cases reviewed in Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington Railroad Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 613\n, 614 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 589.\n We find nothing in these leases to the Southern Pacific Company which justifies the continued control of the Central Pacific by the Southern Pacific after the Sherman Act became effective.\n We come now to the settlement of the Central Pacific debt in 1899, which the court below held to be a practical construction of the Sherman Act, and to warrant the conclusion that the Southern Pacific control of the Central Pacific was not within its condemnation. After hearings and reports, and attempted legislation, Congress passed the act to create a commission to settle the indebtedness of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific Railroads to the United States. This act was passed July 7, 1898 ( 30 Stat. c. 571, p. 659), and constituted the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney Gneral a commission with full power to settle the indebtedness to the government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid of construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond-aided roads upon such terms and in such a manner as might be agreed upon between them and the owners of said road. The act also provided that the settlement should not be binding until approved by the President of the United States; that the commission should not agree to accept a less sum than the full amount of principal and interest and all amounts necessary to reimburse the United States for moneys paid, for interest or otherwise. It provided that the rate of interest upon installments should be not less than 3 per cent. per annum, payable \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 236]\n\u00a0\n semiannually, with such security as the commission might deem expedient; that the final discharge of the indebtedness should not be postponed beyond 10 years; that the whole amount, principal and interest, should be paid in equal semiannual installments within that period; that any settlement made should provide that, if a default were made in the payment of either principal or interest, the whole sum and all installments should immediately become due and payable; that unless the settlement authorized should be perfected within one year the President of the United States should at once proceed to foreclose all liens held by the United States against the railroad companies to collect the indebtedness sought to be settled under the act; and that nothing therein contained should be held to waive or release any right, lien, or cause of action held by the United States.\n Under this act a settlement was effected as of date February 1, 1899. The Central Pacific's debt to the United States for government aid in the construction of lines between Sacramento and Ogden, and Sacramento and San Jose, amounted to $58,812,715.48, one-half of this amount was accrued interest. It was secured by a statutory lien on the bondaided lines, subject to prior first mortgages. The Central Pacific's bonded debt amounted to $57,471,000, largely secured by first mortgages on its various lines of railroad. The outstanding stock was $67,275,500.\n Messrs. Speyer & Co., New York bankers, undertook to formulate the plan, and the agreement of settlement was signed by the commissioners in behalf of the United States, the Central Pacific Railroad Company and Messrs. Speyer & Co. It was approved by the President. By the agreement of settlement the Central Pacific was to execute to the United States 20 promissory notes, dated February 1, 1899, payable, respectively, on or before each 6 months for 10 years, each note for \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 237]\n\u00a0\n the sum of $2,940,635.78, being one-twentieth of the debt, bearing interest at 3 per cent., payable semiannually, all to mature on default in payment of any one of them. Under the agreement gold bonds not exceeding $ 100,000,000 were to be issued, secured by first mortgage on all the Central Pacific lines, bond-aided or not. This mortgage to be prior in lien to any lease of the railroads of the Central Pacific Railroad Company. The bonds were secured by the guaranty of the Southern Pacific. No such agreement of guaranty was embodied in the written settlement, but it was known to the commissioners that the plan contemplated such guaranty. Of these bonds $58,820,000 were to be deposited with the treasurer of the United States as security for the 20 installment notes. Speyer & Co., within one month after the execution and delivery of the notes, were to purchase from the United States the 4 notes first maturing by paying the face thereof for the same, $11,762,543.12 and interest. A proportionate amount of the collateral mortgage bonds was to go with the notes.\n On February 15, 1899, the commission reported the agreement to the House of Representatives. No reference to the guaranty of the Southern Pacific upon the bonds appeared in the report. In the Annual Report of the Attorney General to the Senate and House of November, 1899, the completion of the settlement, which had been made, was set out, and the guaranty of the Southern Pacific was stated, no doubt by inadvertence, to be upon the notes, instead of upon the bonds. The notes, held in the treasury of the United States, were paid primarily by the checks of the Southern Pacific, and charged by that road against the Central Pacific.\n On March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1245, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to dispose of any notes in his possession touching the indebtedness of the Central Pacific Railroad Company to the United \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 238]\n\u00a0\n States. On March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. 1023 [Comp. St.  10064]), the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized and directed to settle claims for interest growing out of transportation services for the government over nonbond-aided lines of the Southern Pacific and the Central Pacific by crediting the amounts on the Central Pacific notes.\n Neither the agreement between the commissioners, the railroad company, and Speyer & Co., nor the report of the commission to Congress, contained any reference to the proposed acquisition of the stock of the Central Pacific by the Southern Pacific. The Speyer plan for the adjustment of the affairs of the Central Pacific was dated February 8, 1899, was put out February 20th of the same year, was extensively published in American and European financial circles, and was given publicity in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle in the February, 1899, issues of that journal. Under the terms of the plan the Central Pacific Railway Company, successors to the Central Pacific Railroad Company, was organized as a corporation of the state of Utah on July 29, 1899. The Central Pacific Railroad Company ( the old corporation of 1861) conveyed all of its property to the new company. On August 1, 1899, the Central Pacific Railway Company executed a refunding mortgage of $100,000,000 to the Central Trust Company of New York, trustee, and a mortgage of $25,000,000 to the Union Trust Company of New York. The Southern Pacific Company executed instruments subordinating its lease to the lien of these mortgages. Thereupon, carrying out the Speyer plan for the Southern Pacific to acquire the stock of the new Central Pacific Railway Company, $20,000,000 of the preferred shares of the latter company were issued, which were taken by the Southern Pacific at par. The outstanding stock of the old Central Pacific was taken by the Southern Pacific, share for share, plus 25 per cent. in the bonds of the Southern Pacific. \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 239]\n\u00a0\n To consummate this transaction Southern Pacific mortgage bonds amounting to $36,819,000 were issued; $20,000,000 thereof were used to acquire the new Central Pacific preferred stock, the balance to provide the 25 per cent. in bonds required to aid in the share for share exchange of the outstanding Central Pacific stock in the hands of private owners. Thus the Southern Pacific under the Speyer plan was to become the owner of the Central Pacific Railway Company stock.\n In the opinion of the District Court it is said:\n'We do not say that the commission was authorized to violate or to sanction the violation of the act of Congress, but the adjustment they effected necessarily involved the question of its pertinence to the business in hand. The acceptance of the guaranty of the Southern Pacific was a recognition that it had sufficient corporate interest in the Central Pacific to justify it. Without such interest its accommodation guaranty of $100,000,000 of bonds of another company would manifestly have been ultra vires-a gross, indefensible excess of its corporate powers. Again, the acceptance of the guaranty implied a recognition of its possible natural result; that is to say, the enforcements of the rights of a guarantor against the property of a debtor. The addition of the stock ownership by the Southern Pacific to its long leasehold interest did not so change the situation as to make unlawful what was not so before.'\n\n We are unable to accept this view. The commission with the approval of the President was authorized to settle the Central Pacific debt in accordance with the terms of the act of 1898. It did not undertake to exercise authority not conferred upon it by giving immunity from the penalties of the Sherman Act. The Attorney General testified that the act was not mentioned in the course of the discussion. The Southern Pacific Company's guaranty of the new bonds was made, so far as that company \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 240]\n\u00a0\n was concerned, from motives of self-interest sufficient in the opinion of those who controlled it to warrant such action. The commissioners, acting for the government, accepted such guaranty. They did not thereby condone, or intend to condone, any act which had the effect to violate the Sherman Act. Nor could this settlement estop the government from prosecuting an action under the provisions of the act.\n It is insisted that the decree in the Union Pacific Case is decisive of this controversy, and amounts to an adjudication against the government of the issues involved. The conclusive answer to this contention is that the Central Pacific was not a party to that suit up to the final decree in this court. That suit and the present one do not relate to the same subject-matter. The issues and questions, therein decided, are not the ones presented for decision here. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 U.S. 351\n; United Shoe Machinery Co. v. United States (decided April 17, 1922) \n258 U.S. 451\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 363, 66 L. Ed. --.\n The defendants contend that the suit is barred by laches on part of the government in failing to institute it earlier. Without deciding that this defense is available when an action is brought under an act of Congress embodying, as does the Sherman Act, an expression of public policy enforceable by criminal prosecution and by civil suit instituted by the Attorney General, we are unable to discover that laches exists in the failure to more promptly prosecute the suit. The stock acquisition complained of was in 1899. In 1901 the Union Pacific acquired control of the Southern Pacific by purchase of sufficient stock to accomplish that purpose. The Union Pacific Case was begun in 1908, and a final decree reached in 1913, and in 1914 this suit was begun.\n Other points are insisted upon in the oral argument and the elaborate briefs of the defendants. We have considered them, but they do not overcome the conclusions here inbefore \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 241]\n\u00a0\n stated, which in our view dispose of this cause, and require a reversal of the decree of the District Court.\n We do not find it necessary to pass upon the government's contention that the leases to the Southern Pacific and the acquisition by it of Central Pacific stock were in and of themselves violative of the Pacific Railroad Acts of Congress of 1862 and subsequent supplemental legislation.\n We direct that a decree be entered severing the control by the Southern Pacific of the Central Pacific by stock ownership or by lease. But, in accomplishing this purpose. so far as compatible therewith, the mortgage lien asserted in the brief filed for the Central Union Trust Company shall be protected.\n In addition, the several terminal lines and cut-offs leading to San Francisco Bay which have been constructed or acquired during the unified control of the two systems for the purpose of affording direct or convenient access to the bay and to the principal terminal facilities about the bay should be dealt with, either by way of apportionment or by provisions for joint or common use, in such manner as will secure to both companies such full, convenient, and ready access to the bay and to terminal facilities thereon that each company will be able freely to compete with the other, to serve the public efficiently, and to accomplish the purpose of the legislation under which it was constructed. And a like course should be pursued in dealing with the lines extending from San Francisco Bay to Sacramento and to Portland, Or.\n To the end that an appropriate decree may be framed, the District Court may and should bring in additional parties whenever that may become advisable in executing our directions.\n Reversed and remanded accordingly.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 242]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment of the court. To this I feel constrained because I think it is unjust for the government to enforce a dissolution of the relation existing between the Central Pacific Railway Company and the Southern Pacific Company. I put my action on that ground alone, though much can be said on the other grounds urged by the government and contested by the appellee companies.\n Prior to this relation another existed between the two companies or systems (they may be said to have had that pretention and extent) constituted by a lease for 99 years, executed in 1885 by the Central Pacific Railroad Company to the Southern Pacific, giving to the latter the dominion of a proprietor. Waskey v. Chambers, \n224 \nU.S. 564, 565\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 597, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 998.\n The Central Pacific Railroad Company was a bond-aided road, and on account of it was under obligation to repay the government the aid it had received, and Congress by an act passed July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 659), created a commission with power to settle the indebtedness. An agreement of settlement was made in which the Southern Pacific was a participant, and by it assured the payment of the securities provided for in the agreement of settlement between the Central Pacific Railroad Company and the government.\n This participation was contemplated in the scheme submitted by Speyer & Company to the Commission,1 and \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 243]\n\u00a0\n the present relation of the company is the outcome of the settlement, and it may be said, is the substitute of the \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 244]\n\u00a0\n rights and control the Southern Pacific, as lessee, had of the Central Pacific Railroad Company.\n Was it a justifiable substitute? The answer should be in the affirmative. When the act of 1898 was passed the situation was serious, the problem complex, and because the problem was complex three Cabinet officers were selected to solve it. These were the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General. Their prominence in the government, their official concern with the subject- matter, assured fidelity in the execution of the trust, and repels charge or intimation that they were, or could be, actuated by anything other than a strict consideration of duty and the exercise of their trust; and their ability assured judgment in the selection of means. The problem, it is to be remembered, was something more than to ascertain the amount of the debt. It involved, it might be, foreclosure of the government's liens and, it might also be, government ownership and all that that meant.\n The debt was known to be $58,812,715.48. It was secured by a mortgage on the lines of the Central Pacific Railroad Company, it is true, but the mortgage was subordinate to other mortgages for about the same amount. It was to be rescued from this subordination, and given independent and certain solvency. The power given to the commissioners was necessary to and commensurate with the purpose. The power was 'to settle the indebtedness' 'upon such terms and in such manner' as 'might be' 'agreed upon' and to take 'such security as' might 'seem expedient.' The only limitation was that the payment was not to be extended more than 10 years.\n Necessarily, therefore, there was power to view the situation and judge of it, its legal and practical aspects, and what was possible in law and fact in the interest of all concerned to be done and it may be presumed that the commission found that there was nothing exigent in the \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 245]\n\u00a0\n situation or that demanded the separation of the Southern Pacific from the Central Pacific, and that the guaranty of the former could be accepted, and all that would follow from it. And it is to be remembered that the action of the commission received the sanction of the President, and was reported to Congress. It either had objected, the settlement as planned could not have been accomplished, and both would have objected, if they had discerned anything sinister or inimical to law in it or that would result from it.\n It is said, however, that there was no affirmative approval by Congress, and that its approval cannot be assumed from nonaction.\n The government makes much of this, ignoring all else, and ventures, in a kind of desperation, against the circumstances, the incredible assertion that Congress was ignorant of the guaranty of the Southern Pacific and its contributing efficiency; and this against an irresistible presumption to the contrary and in defiance of the fact that the Attorney General reported to Congress the terms of settlement and that the notes taken in settlement were guaranteed by the Southern Pacific, and in defiance of the further fact that the bonds that it was provided were to be deposited as security for the notes with the Secretary of the Treasury had indorsed upon them the guaranty of the Southern Pacific, and that the financial and commercial journals of the country, addressing the business world-the world that was to accept the notes which Congress authorized the Secretary to sell-explained the settlement and the relation of the Southern Pacific to it, and the assurance of safety and value the guarantee of the Southern Pacific gave.\n I need not dwell on the contention of the government; the court has not been impressed by it. The court's view is, rejecting that of the District Court, that there was no acceptance by the commission of the Southern Pacific's \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 246]\n\u00a0\n guaranty which carried obligation, and that the guaranty was the prompting of interest on the part of the Southern Pacific. I concede the latter. The enterprise that is necessary, and is exhibited in the conduct of great railroad systems, whose traffic is concerned with a continent, is not induced by the altruistic; it is, and naturally must be, prompted by interest; but it, as other transactions of the business world, is entitled to legal sanction and remedy.\n The court asserts an interest in the Southern Pacific that urged its guaranty, but does not explain the interest. It is of pertinent concern to consider what it was. It manifestly was no other than the relation of the company to the Central Pacific Railway Company through stock ownership. The company would necessarily have no concern or interest in the Central Pacific (the new company), or the payment of the old company's debts to the government, if it was to be separated from the Central Pacific and declared a competitor and a business antagonist; and this must have been apparent to every one connected with the transactions, if they gave any reflection to them-anything but a haphazard and reckless attention, inconsiderate of practical and legal consequences. This cannot be assumed, and the contrary must be; that is, that the guaranty of the Southern Pacific was accepted as necessary to the settlement of the debt.\n I repeat, and summarize, that the situation was of great concern to the government. Its solution was the consummation desired, and through the aid of the Southern Pacific. The company's guaranty was assurance to the business world that behind the notes and bonds of the Central Pacific were the great properties of the Southern Pacific and the competency of its management; and the company made sacrifices in addition to the guaranty, and they, and it, were accepted by the government, and therefore the benefit that the company expected cannot be denied it. \n\n[259 U.S. 214, 247]\n\u00a0\n There was no thought in any one's mind that the acquisition of stock by the Southern Pacific in the Central Pacific would be a restraint upon competition, or a detriment to the public interest. The attitude of those concerned in the transaction can be accurately realized by the reflection that the interest-control, if it may be so called-that the Southern Pacific acquired in or over the new company (the railway company) was not greater nor more offensive to law than it had in or over the old company ( the railroad company). The latter control existed from the enactment of the law until it was superseded by the agreement, a period of 8 years. And there was no revulsion against or condemnation of the control-not by the government, whose duty it was to proceed against it, if it violated the Anti-Trust Law; not by any business interest, though for such interest the law was enacted as a protection. This suit was not brought until 1914, 15 years after the agreement; not, however, by the government of the agreement, but by the government of a much later time.\n I think, however, that the decree of the District Court should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] James Speyer, of the firm of Speyer & Co., being on the witness stand, the following is part of his testimony:\n'Q. Please state whether the Central Pacific could have complied with the conditions imposed by that act of Congress [act of 1898] without a financial readjustment of their affairs of the kind contained in the readjustment which you arranged for?'\n\n The question was objected to, but the witness answered.\n'The Witness: Without some kind of readjustment, they could not have complied.

Mr. Speyer, when you started to work upon that plan of readjustment did you expect and count upon the intervention and aid of the Southern Pacific Company?\n\n'A. I knew I could not carry it through without the help of the Southern Pacific, or some other railroad company, in case the Southern Pacific had not come to assist.\n\n'Q.

And that plan could not have been carried through without the intervention and aid of the Southern Pacific Company.'\n\n The question was objected to.\n'Q. Mr. Speyer, considering the terms required by the act of Congress, namely, the requirement that the entire debt of $58,800,000, in round numbers, would have to be paid in 10 years, in 20 semianual installments, would any one at all familiar with the Central Pacific affairs know that the Central Pacific, with its own resources and credit, could not comply with those conditions?\n\n'A. He would.\n\n'Q. It would be obvious to any one at all familiar with the affairs of the Central Pacific that it could not with its own resources and credit comply with the terms of that act?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. In making the agreement which you participated in with the United States, what did you count upon to enable you to carry out the agreement with the United States.\n\n'A.

WONG SING(1922)\nNo. 44\nArgued: October 11, 1922Decided: October 23, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Error to review the action of the District Court in dismissing an indictment against defendant in error. The indictment was in two counts. The first count charged that Wong Sing feloniously had in his possession and under his control, at a specified date, certain derivatives and preparations of morphine and cocaine for the purpose of sale and distribution; he not being registered under the provisions of the act of Congress approved \n\n[260 U.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n December 17, 1914, and its amendments (Comp. St.  6287 et seq.), and not having paid the special tax required by the Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The second count charged that Wong Sing, at a specified date and time on such date, and at a specified place in Salt Lake City, within the jurisdiction of the court, knowingly, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously purchased, from a person or persons unknown to the grand jurors, morphine and cocaine, the exact quantity being unknown to the grand jurors; the said drugs not being in the original stamped packages, or from the original stamped packages; he not having then and there obtained the drugs from a registered dealer in pursuance of a prescription written for legitimate medical uses by a practitioner registered under the act of December, 17, 1914, and its amendments; and the purchase not being by a patient from a registered practitioner in the course of his professional practice, and he, Wong Sing, not being then and there registered under the provisions of the act of Congress, and not having then and there, or theretofore, or at all, paid the special tax provided by the act-contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States of America.\n Wong Sing, upon being arraigned, pleaded not guilty, but subsequently withdrew the plea and demurred to the indictment 'for failure to state an offense, and being insufficient.' The demurrer was sustained, and he was discharged from all liability thereon.\n The court made a certificate, to be part of the record and proceedings, that the first count of the indictment was based upon section 8 of the Act of Congress of December 17, 1914, commonly called the Harrison Anti-Narcotic \n\n[260 U.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n Act, and that he sustained the demurrer to that count upon the authority of United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854. And the court further certified that the second count of the indictment was based upon the amended Harrison Anti- Narcotic Act contained in section 1006 of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18 (40 Stat. 1130; Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6287g), and that the count was predicated upon the following provisions: 'It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute any of the aforesaid drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package ...'-and that he construed 'the word 'persons' in the foregoing language to mean the persons enumerated in the first paragraph of section 1006, namely, 'Every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses, or gives away opium, or coca leaves, or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation thereof, shall register with the collector of internal revenue of the district, his name or style, place of business and place or places where such business is to be carried on, and pay the special taxes hereinafter provided.\"\n The demurrer was sustained, it was further certified, because the second count contained no appropriate allegation giving effect to the word 'person,' and hence fell within the ruling in the Jin Fuey Moy Case, otherwise, it was said, the amendment would be unconstitutional; and, further, that the demurrer was treated as presenting that question of construction, and was sustained only for that reason.\n The construction by the court of section 1006 constitutes the question in the case. It is attacked by the United States as not justified, and United States v. Doremus, \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 214, and Webb v. United States, \n249 U.S. 96\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 217, are cited.\n We are unable to concur with the District Court. The provisions quoted by the court have a certain relation but they have also a certain independence. The first \n\n[260 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n makes it 'unlawful for any person to purchase' the drugs; the second enumerates other persons who have a larger connection with the drugs, and requires them to register the fact and pay the tax prescribed. There could be no object in requiring a purchaser of the drugs to register, but it fulfilled the purpose of the law to forbid a purchase 'except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package.' The requirement fortifies the other injunctions of the statute.\n In Doremus v. United States and Webb et al. v. United States, it was decided that the power of Congress, exerted through the act of 1914, though the act might be denominated a revenue measure, could, as a complement to it, make criminally unlawful the sale, barter or exchange of narcotic drugs, except under certain prescribed conditions designed to make effective as a revenue measure. The principle of the decision applies to the act of 1919 upon which count 2 is based. If the law can put conditions upon sellers, it can put conditions with a like purpose upon purchasers which is done here. Therefore the apprehension of the District Court, if it should be so held, that the act would be unconstitutional under the decision in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854, was not justified. There is another distinction between the Jin Fuey Moy Case and this. In that case, which was under the act of 1914, it was intimated that the persons affected by the act received definition from the requirement of registration. This case is under the act of 1919, and it, as we have said, does not require registration.\n It follows that the judgment of the District Court must be and it is--\n Reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Counsel for the United States say that only the second count is material on this writ of error.

Alleging that Thomas Atkins never existed and that his enrollment came about through fraud and gross mistake of law and fact, the United States brought this proceeding against many defendants to annul the allotment certificate and patent and to quiet title in the Tribe.\n Minnie Atkins maintains that the enrolled Thomas was her son; that he was born prior to April 1, 1899, and died thereafter, leaving her as sole heir. Nancy Atkins claims to be the mother and sole heir. She filed a cross-bill asking that the title to the land be confirmed to her and those claiming through her. Henry Carter asserts that he is the individual enrolled as Thomas Atkins.\n The trial court ruled that the enrollment by the Commission amounted to an adjudication that Thomas Atkins was a living person on April 1, 1899, entitled to membership; that this finding was not subject to collateral attack under a mere allegation of his nonexistence; and that it could not be annulled for fraud, unless the fraud alleged and proved was such as to have prevented a full hearing within the doctrine approved by United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 U.S. 61\n, Vance v. Burbank, \n101 U.S. 514\n, and Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 U.S. 113\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 139. The relief asked by the United States was accordingly denied. Having considered the voluminous testimony, it found Minnie Atkins to be the mother of Thomas and owner of the land subject to the rights of those claiming under her. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a final decree embodying these conclusions. Folk v. United States, 233 Fed. 177, 147 C. C. A. 183; United States v. Atkins, 268 Fed. 923.\n In United States v. Wildcat, \n244 \nU.S. 111, 118\n, 119 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 561, 564 (61 L. Ed. 1024), it was insisted that the Indian died prior to April 1, 1899, and that his enrollment as of that date was beyond the jurisdiction of the Dawes Commission and void within the doctrine of Scott v. McNeal, \n154 U.S. 34\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1108. Much consideration was given to the statutes creating and defining \n\n[260 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n the powers of the Commission and the effect of an enrollment. This court said:\n'There was thus constituted a quasi judicial tribunal whose judgments within the limits of its jurisdiction were only subject to attack for fraud or such mistake of law or fact as would justify the holding that its judgments were voidable. Congress by this legislation evidenced an intention to put an end to controversy by providing a tribunal before which those interested could be heard and the rolls authoritatively made up of those who were entitled to participate in the partition of the tribal lands. It was to the interest of all concerned that the beneficiaries of this division should be ascertained. To this end the Commission was established and endowed with authority to hear and determine the matter. ...\n\n'When the Commission proceeded in good faith to determine the matter and to act upon information before it, not arbitrarily, but according to its best judgment, we think it was the intention of the act that the matter, upon the approval of the Secretary, should be finally concluded and the rights of the parties forever settled, subject to such attacks as could successfully be made upon judgments of this character for fraud or mistake.\n\n'We cannot agree that the case is within the principles decided in Scott v. McNeal, \n154 U.S. 34\n, and kindred cases, in which it has been held that in the absence of a subject-matter of jurisdiction an adjudication that there was such is not conclusive, and that a judgment based upon action without its proper subject being in existence is void. ... We think the decision of such tribunal, when not impeached for fraud or mistake, conclusive of the question of membership in the tribe, when followed, as was the case here, by the action of the Interior Department confirming the allotment and ordering the patents conveying the lands, which were in fact issued.'\n\n It must be accepted now as finally settled that the enrollment of a member of an Indian tribe by the Dawes \n\n[260 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n Commission, when duly approved, amounts to a judgment in an adversary proceeding determining the existence of the individual and his right to membership subject, of course, to impeachment under the well established rules where such judgments are involved.\n The questions of fact relating to the conflicting claims advanced by Minnie Atkins, Nancy Atkins, and Henry Carter have been determined in favor of Minnie by both courts below upon survey of all the evidence; and we find nothing which would justify us in overruling their well considered action.\n The decree of the court below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. LANZA(1922)\nNo. 39\nArgued: November 23, 1922Decided: December 11, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n Mr. John F. Dore, of Seattle, Wash., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error by the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act (34 Stat. c. 2564, p. 1246 [U. S. Comp. St.  1704]), to reverse an order of the District Court for the Western District of Washington dismissing five counts of an indictment presented against the defendants in error April 28, 1920. The first of these charged the defendants with manufacturing intoxicating liquor, the second with transporting it, the third with possessing it, and the fourth and fifth with having a still and material designed for its manufacture \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n about April 12, 1920, in violation of the National Prohibition Act ( chapter 85, 41 Stat. 305). The defendants filed a special plea in bar setting out that on April 16, 1920, an information was filed in the superior court of Whatcom county, Wash., charging the same defendants with manufacturing, transporting and having in possession the same liquor, and that on the same day a judgment was entered against each defendant for $ 250 for manufacturing, $250 for transporting, and $250 for having in possession such liquor. The information was filed under a statute of Washington in force before the going into effect of the Eighteenth Amendment and passage of the National Prohibition Act. Remington's Code,  6262-1 et seq., as amended by Sess. Laws 1917, p. 46. The government demurred to the plea. The District Court sustained the plea and dismissed the five counts. United States v. Peterson, 268 Fed. 864. No point is made by the government in the assignments of error that counts 4 and 5, for having a still and material in possession, were not covered by the information and judgment by the state court.\n The Eighteenth Amendment is as follows:\n'Section, 1. After one year from the ratification of this article, the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from, the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof, for beverage purposes, is hereby prohibited.\n\n'Sec. 2. The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n The defendants insist that two punishments for the same act, one under the National Prohibition Act and the other under a state law, constitute double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment; and in support of this position it is argued that both laws derive their force from the same \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n authority-the second section of the amendment-and therefore that in principle it is as if both punishments were in prosecutions by the United Stats in its courts.\n Consideration of this argument requires an analysis of the reason and purpose of the second section of the amendment. We dealt with both sections in the National Prohibition Cases, \n253 U.S. 350\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 486, 588. The conclusions of the court, relevant here, are Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n'6. The first section of the amendment, the one embodying the prohibition, is operative throughout the entire territorial limits of the United States, binds all legislative bodies, courts, public officers and individuals within those limits, and of its own force invalidates every legislative act-whether by Congress, by a state Legislature, or by a territorial assembly-which authorizes or sanctions what the section prohibits.\n\n'7. The second section of the amendment, the one declaring 'the Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation,' does not enable Congress or the several states to defeat or to thwart the prohibition, but only to enforce it by appropriate means.\n\n'8. The words 'concurrent power' in that section do not mean joint power, or require that legislation thereunder by Congress, to be effective, shall be approved or sanctioned by the several states or any of them; nor do they mean that the power to enforce is divided between Congress and the several states along the lines which separae or distinguish foreign and interstate commerce from intrastate affairs.\n\n'9. The power confided to Congress by that section, while not exclusive, is territorially coextensive with the prohibition of the first section, embraces manufacture and other intrastate transactions as well as importation, exportation and interstate traffic, and is in no wise dependent on or affected by action or inaction on the part of the several states or any of them.' \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n The amendment was adopted for the purpose of establishing prohibition as a national policy reaching every part of the United States and affecting transactions which are essentially local or intrastate, as well as those pertaining to interstate or foreign commerce. The second section means that power to take legislative measures to make the policy effective shall exist in Congress in respect of the territorial limits of the United States and at the same time the like power of the several states within their territorial limits shall not cease to exist. Each state, as also Congress, may exercise an independent judgment in selecting and shaping measures to enforce prohibition. Such as are adopted by Congress become laws of the United States and such as are adopted by a state become laws of that state. They may vary in many particulars, including the penalties prescribed, but this is an inseparable incident of independent legislative action in distinct jurisdictions.\n\n To regard the amendment as the source of the power of the states to adopt and enforce prohibition measures is to take a partial and erroneous view of the matter. Save for some restrictions arising out of the federal Constitution, chiefly the commerce clause, each state possessed that power in full measure prior to the amendment, and the probable purpose of declaring a concurrent power to be in the states was to negative any possible inference that in vesting the national government with the power of country-wide prohibition, state power would be excluded. In effect the second section of the Eighteenth Amendment put an end to restrictions upon the state's power arising out of the federal Constitution and left her free to enact prohibition laws applying to all transactions within her limits. To be sure, the first section of the amendment took from the states all power to authorize acts falling within its prohibition, but it did not cut down or displace prior state laws not inconsistent with it. Such laws derive their force, as do all new ones consisten with \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n it, not from this amendment, but from power originally belonging to the states, preserved to them by the Tenth Amendment, and now relieved from the restriction heretofore arising out of the federal Constitution. This is the ratio decidendi of our decision in Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, \n258 U.S. 403\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 330 (April 10, 1922).\n We have here two sovereignties, deribing power from different sources, capable of dealing with the same subjectmatter within the same territory. Each may, without interference by the other, enact laws to secure prohibition, with the limitation that no legislation can give validity to acts prohibited by the amendment. Each government in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other.\n It follows that an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each. The Fifth Amendment, like all the other guaranties in the first eight amendments, applies only to proceedings by the federal government (Barron v. City of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243), and the double jeopardy therein forbidden is a second prosecution under authority of the federal government after a first trial for the same offense under the same authority. Here the same act was an offense against the state of Washington, because a violation of its law, and also an offense against the United States under the National Prohibition Act. The defendants thus committed two different offenses by the same act, and a conviction by a court of Washington of the offense against that state is not a conviction of the different offense against the United States, and so is not double jeopardy.\n This view of the Fifth Amendment is supported by a long line of decisions by this court. In Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 410, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio was under review. It affirmed a conviction under a state law \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n punishing the uttering of a false United States silver dollar. The law was attacked as beyond the power of the state. One ground urged was that, as the coinage of the dollar was intrusted by the Constitution to Congress, it had authority to protect it against false coins by prohibiting not only the act of making them, but also the act of uttering them. It was contended that if the state could denounce the uttering, there would be concurrent jurisdiction in the United States and the state, a conviction in the state court would be a bar to prosecution in a federal court, and thus a state might confuse or embarrass the federal government in the exercise of its power to protect its lawful coinage. Answering this argument, Mr. Justice Daniel for the court said (5 How. 434):\n'It is almost certain that, in the benignant spirit in which the institutions both of the state and federal systems are administered, an offender who should have suffered the penalties denounced by the one would not be subjected a second time to punishment by the other for acts essentially the same, unless indeed this might occur in instances of peculiar enormity, or where the public safety demanded extraordinary rigor. But were a contrary course of policy and action either probable or usual, this would by no means justify the conclusion, that offenses falling within the competency of different authorities to restrain or punish them would not properly be subjected to the consequences which those authorities might ordain and affix to their perpetration.'\n\n This conclusion was affirmed in United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560, 569 (13 L. Ed. 257), where the same justice said that--\n'The same act might, as to its character and tendencies, and the consequences it involved, constitute an offense against both the state and federal governments, and might draw to tis commission the penalties denounced by either, as appropriate to its character in reference to each.' \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 384]\n\u00a0\n The principle was reaffirmed in Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, in United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 550\n, 551 S., in EX parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371, 389\n, 390 S., 391, in Cross v. North Carolina, \n132 \nU.S. 131, 139\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 47, in Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 209\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 542, in Crossley v. California, \n168 \nU.S. 640, 641\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 242, in Southern Ry. Co. v. R. R. Com. Indiana, \n236 U.S. 439\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 304, in Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 125, and, finally, in McKelvey v. United States, \n260 U.S. 353\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 132, 67 L. Ed. --, decided December 4, 1922\n\n\n\n In Southern Ry. Co. v. R. R. Com. Indiana, supra, Mr Justice Lamar used this language:\n'In support of this position numerous cases are cited, which, like Cross v. North Carolina, \n132 U.S. 131\n, hold that the same act may constitute a criminal offense against two sovereignties, and that punishment by one does not prevent punishment by the other. That doctrine is thoroughly established. But, upon an analysis of the principle on which it is founded, it will be found to relate only to cases where the act sought to be punished is one over which both sovereignties have jurisdiction. This concurrent jurisdiction may be either because the nature of the act is such that at the same time it produces effects respectively within the sphere of state and federal regulation and thus violates the laws of both, or where there is this double effect in a matter of which one can exercise control, but an authoritative declaration that the paramount jurisdiction of one shall not exclude that of the other.'\n\n These last words are peculiarly appropriaate to the case presented by the two sections of the Eighteenth Amendment. The court below is the only District Court which has held conviction in a state court a bar to prosecution for the same act under the Volstead Law. United States v. Holt ( D. C.) 270 Fed. 639; United States v. Bostow (D. C.) 273 Fed. 535; United States v. Regan (D. C.) 273 Fed. 727; United States v. Ratagczak (D. C.) 275 Fed. 558. \n\n[260 U.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for defendants in error invoke the principle that as between federal and state jurisdictions over the same prisoner, the one which first gets jurisdiction may first exhaust its jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other. Ponzi v. Fessenden at al., \n258 U.S. 254\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 309, decided March 27, 1922. This is beside the point and has no application. The effect of the ruling of the court below was to exclude the United States from jurisdiction to punish the defendants after the state court had exhausted its jurisdiction, and when there was no conflict of jurisdiction.\n If Congress sees fit to bar prosecution by the federal courts for any act when punishment for violation of state prohibition has been imposed, it can, of course, do so by proper legislative provision; but it has not done so. If a state were to punish the manufacture, transportation and sale of intoxicating liquor by small or nominal fines, the race of offenders to the courts of that state to plead guilty and secure immunity from federal prosecution for such acts would not make for respect for the federal statute or for its deterrent effect. But it is not for us to discuss the wisdom of legislation; it is enough for us to hold that in the absence of special provision by Congress, conviction and punishment in a state court under a state law for making, transporting and selling intoxicating liquors is not a bar to a prosecution in a court of the United States under the federal law for the same acts.\n Judgment reversed, with direction to sustain the demurrer to the special plea in bar of the defendants and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Oregon Lumber Co. \n260 U.S. 290\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[260 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. Lair Thompson, of Portland, Or., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n This case is here upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under section 239 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1216).\n The plaintiff in error brought an action at law against the defendant in error in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon to recover damages for the fraudulent acquisition of certain lands. The complaint was filed in February, 1918, and alleged that the Oregon Lumber Company, a corporation, and certain of its officers, named as codefendants, unlawfully conspired to acquire certain tracts of land in Oregon, under the Timber and Stone Act of June 3, 1878 (20 Stat. 89 [Comp. St.  4671 et seq.]). The lands were patented in 1900, subsequently conveyed by the patentees to an officer of the defendant corporation, and thereafter (with the exception of a small tract) transferred by such officer to the corporation. The value of the lands was alleged to be $65,000 and judgment was asked for this amount.\n The answer denied the material allegations of the complaint and pleaded, among other things, as separate defenses:\n'(1) That pro tanto to the measure of damages the United States received from the several entrymen named in the complaint the aggregate sum of $16,400, which was the price fixed by law and the practices in the Land Office for the lands described in the complaint ; (2) that in October, 1912, the United States brought suit in equity to set aside the patents for the lands, and alleged that it owned the property described in the complaint herein and that the patents for the lands which are the same as are involved in this action were secured through fraud of the defendants named in the present action and others, and prayed for the cancellation of the patents; that in the equity suit substantially the same facts were pleaded as are pleaded by the United States in this action; that issue was joined in the equity suit; that in 1916, after trial upon the merits, the District Court dismissed the equity \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n suit, for the reason that the United States had had full knowledge of the matters complained of in its complaint for more than 6 years before the equity suit was instituted, and that no appeal was ever taken from the decree dismissing the complaint of the United States.'\n\n The plaintiff in error demurred to these separate defenses, and the District Court having overruled the demurrer and the plaintiff in error having declined to plead further, the court dismissed the complaint and judgment was entered.\n The District Court, in rendering its judgment, decided that, inasmuch as the suit in equity was brought by the United States with knowledge of all the facts, it constituted an election final and conclusive.\n Upon these facts the following questions are propounded by the Circuit Court of Appeals:\n'1. Is an action by the United States for the value of lands as damages, against the patentees for the lands for fraudulent acquisition of the lands patented under the Timber and Stone Act, barred where more than 6 years have elapsed after the United States, with knowledge of the fraud, brought a suit in equity to cancel the patents for the same lands, in which equity suit decree of dismissal was made against the United States on the ground that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations?\n\n'2. If the foregoing question be answered in the negative, should any damages recoverable be reduced by such amounts as the United States may have received from the entrymen, as the price fixed by law for the lands described in the patents?'\n\n Upon the facts stated the sale was voidable (Moran v. Horsky, \n178 \nU.S. 205, 212\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 856), and the plaintiff in error was entitled either to disaffirm the same and recover the lands, or affirm it and recover damages for the fraud. It could not do both. Both remedies were appropriate to the facts, but they were inconsistent, since the first was founded \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n upon a disaffirmance and the second upon an affirmance of a voidable transaction. Robb v. Vos, \n155 \nU.S. 13, 43\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 4; Connihan v. Thompson, 111 Mass. 270, 270; 2 Black on Rescission and Cancellation,  562, and cases cited. The rule is applicable to the government in cases where patents have been procured by fraud. United States v. Koleno, 226 Fed. 180, 183, 141 C. C. A. 178. Any decisive action by a party, with knowledge of his rights and of the facts, determines his election in the case of inconsistent remedies, and one of the most unequivocal of such determinative acts is the bringing of a suit based upon one or the other of these inconsistent conclusions. Robb v. Vos, supra.\n It is suggested in the brief for the plaintiff in error that there is not such inconsistency between a suit to recover lands patented because of fraud and an action to recover damages for the fraud as to bar the latter, citing Friederichsen v. Renard, \n247 U.S. 207\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 450. That case, however, lends no support to the suggestion. The petitioner, Friederichsen, brought suit to cancel a contract for the exchange of lands, on the ground of fraud practiced upon him. Upon the coming in of the report of the master it appeared that petitioner, pending suit, had cut a considerable amount of timber growing upon the lands which he had taken in exchange. Thereupon the court found that he was not entitled to equitable relief, because, by cutting the timber, he had ratified the contract and had rendered it impossible to put the defendant in statu quo, but his remedy was at law for damages. The court ordered that the master's report be vacated and the case transferred to the law side of the court, pursuant to equity rule 22 (33 Sup. Ct. xxiv), and 'that the parties 'file amended pleadings to conform with an action at law .\" The question was there presented for decision whether this was the commencement of a new action, so as to bring it within the bar of the statute of limitations, and it was determined in the negative. Holding further \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n that under the circumstances the doctrine of election of remedies did not apply, this court said:\n'Thus, we are brought to the conclusion that since the two remedies asserted by the petitioner were alternative remedies, and since the order made, requiring the conversion of the suit in equity into one at law, was entered by the court sitting in chancery, for us to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the petitioner, in obeying the order of the trial court, made a fatal choice of an inconsistent remedy, would be to subordinate substance to form of procedure, with the result of defeating a claim which the respondents stipulated had been sufficiently established to justify a verdict against them. This we cannot consent to do.'\n\n But here in the equity suit the plaintiff in error, upon the coming in of the defendant's plea of the statute of limitations, made no offer to amend or request to transfer the case to the law docket, but proceeded to trial and judgment upon the original bill, with knowledge of all the facts for more than 6 years prior to the filing of its bill. Defeated in its equity suit, it brought its action at law upon the same allegations of fact. We think it is not admissible to thus speculate upon the action of the court, and having met with an adverse decision, to again vex the defendant with another and inconsistent action upon the same facts.\n The justice of enforcing the doctrine of election of remedies in this case is emphasized by a consideration of the facts. The lands in question were conveyed by the United States in the year 1900. It was not until 1912 that the first suit was brought. The judgment, dismissing the bill in that suit, was rendered in 1916, and the present action was brought 2 years later. Thus a period of 18 years had elapsed since the transfer of the lands before the present action was begun, during more than two-thirds of which time the United States had possessed \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 297]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of all the facts upon which the plea of the statute of limitations was founded and sustained.\n The mere filing of the bill in the first suit, according to many authorities, did not constitute an irrevocable election. But upon ascertaining from their plea that the defendants intended to rely upon the statute of limitations, and having knowledge of the facts upon which that plea was founded, and thereafter sustained, the plaintiff in error had fairly presented to it the alternative: (a) Of abandoning that suit and beginning an action at law or transferring it to the law side of the court and making the necessary amendments to convert it into an action for damages, as a 'mere incident in the progress of the original case' (\n247 U.S. 210\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 451); or (b) of proceeding with the original case upon the issues as they stood. The plaintiff in error deliberately chose the latter alternative. If the election was not final before, it became final and irrevocable then. Rehfield v. Winters, 62 Or. 299, 305, 306, 125 Pac. 289; Bowker Fertilizer Co. v. Cox, 106 N. Y. 555, 558, 559, 13 N. E. 95; Moss v. Marks, 70 Neb. 701, 703, 97 N. W. 1031\n\n\n The case of Bistline v. United States, 229 Fed. 546, 144 C. C. A. 6, relied upon by the plaintiff in error, is not in conflict with this conclusion. That was an action by the government to recover damages for the fraudulent acquisition of certain public lands. A prior suit had been brought in equity to cancel the patent, but the defendant's answer showed that the land had been conveyed to persons not made parties to the suit. The government thereupon promptly dismissed its suit in equity, and on the same day commenced the action at law for damages. If, in the instant case, a like course had been followed upon the coming in of the defendant's answer pleading the statute of limitations, the case just referred to would have been in point.\n Northern Assurance Co. v. Grand View Building Association, \n203 U.S. 106\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 27, William W. Bierce, Limited, v. Hutchins, \n205 U.S. 340\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 524, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 298]\n\u00a0\n et al., \n250 U.S. 483\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 533, cited by plaintiff in error in support of its contention, are all distinguishable from the case now under consideration. In Northern Assurance Co. v. Grand View Building Association, supra, an action at law had been brought to enforce an insurance policy, but it was held that no recovery could be had on the policy as it stood. Thereupon a suit was brought to reform the policy and enforce it as reformed. It was held that there was no inconsistency between these two remedies, and clearly there was not, since both cases proceeded in affirmance of the contract. In Bierce v. Hutchins, supra, there had been a conditional sale. Plaintiff first undertook to enforce a lien upon the property and later brought an action in replevin. It was held there was no election because plaintiff could not enforce a lien upon property to which it had title. This court said:\n'It [appellant] could not obliterate the condition and leave the contract in force. It may be that it had an election to avoid the contract altogether, but, if so, it did not attempt to do it. It insisted on the contract as the ground of its claim to a lien for the price of the goods. The election supposed and relied upon is an election to keep the contract in force, but to leave out the reservation of title. ... But the assertion of a lien by one who has title, so long as it is only as assertion and nothing more, is merely a mistake. It does not purport to be a choice, and it cannot be one because the party has no right to choose. The claim in the lien suit, as was said in a recent case, was not an election but an hypothesis.'\n\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert et al., supra, there had been much prior litigation over the same subject-matter. It was contended that the plaintiffs were bound as privies to this litigation. As appears by the decision of the lower court (Bogert et al. v. Southern Pacific Co., 244 Fed. 61, 156 C. C. A. 489) the grievance alleged in the prior suits was a corporate grievance. Each of the suits was dismissed on the ground that the decree of foreclosure \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 299]\n\u00a0\n involved could not be attacked collaterally. The Bogert suit, however, was a suit on behalf of the minority stockholders, asserting no corporate right of the railway company, but only the right of minority stockholders. The right asserted in the prior suits and that asserted in the Bogert suit were, therefore, the rights of different parties.\n It is further urged that the judgment of the District Court was not upon the merits, but upon the plea in bar, and that therefore, when the equity suit was begun, plaintiff in error had no choice of remedies, since the judgment rendered established that in fact there was no remedy in equity at all. The contention, we think, is unsound.\n The defense of the statute of limitations is not a technical defense but substantial and meritorious. The great weight of modern authority is to this effect. Lilly-Brackett Co. v. Sonnemann, 157 Cal. 192, 106 Pac. 715, 21 Ann. Cas. 1279, and Wheeler v. Castor, 11 N. D. 347, 353, 92 N. W. 381, 61 L. R. A. 746, et seq., where the authorities are reviewed.\n Such statutes are not only statutes of repose, but they supply the place of evidence lost or impaired by lapse of time, by raising a presumption which renders proof unnecessary. Bell v. Morrison, 1 Pet. 351, 360; Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 538; Wood v. Carpenter, \n101 U.S. 135\n, 139; Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Co., 7 Wall. 386, 390. And see United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n209 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 579.\n In Wood v. Carpenter, this court said:\n'Statutes of limitation are vital to the welfare of society and are favored in the law. They are found and approved in all systems of enlightened jurisprudence. They promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs. An important public policy lies at their foundation. They stimulate to activity and punish negligence. While time is constantly destroying the evidence \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 300]\n\u00a0\n of rights, they supply its place by a presumption which renders proof unnecessary. Mere delay, extending to the limit prescribed, is itself a conclusive bar. The bane and antidote go together.'\n\n In Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Company:\n'They are founded upon the general experience of mankind that claims which are valid, are not usually allowed to remain neglected. The lapse of years without any attempt to enforce a demand creates, therefore, a presumption against its original validity, or that it has ceased to subsist. This presumption is made by these statutes a positive bar; and they thus become statutes of repose, protecting parties from the prosecution of stale claims, when, by loss of evidence from death of some witnesses, and the imperfect recollection of others, or the destruction of documents, it might be impossible to establish the truth.'\n\n In Parkes v. Clift, 9 Lea (Tenn.) 524, it was held that a decree dismissing a bill on the ground of lapse of time was a judgment upon the merits. The court said (pages 531, 532):\n'In order that a judgment or decree should be on the merits, it is not necessary that the litigation should be determined 'on the merits,' in the moral or abstract sense of these words. It is sufficient that the status of the action was such that the parties might have had their suit thus disposed of, if they had properly presented and managed their respective cases. ... A finding against a party, either upon final hearing or demurrer, that his cause of action as shown by him, is barred by the statute of limitations or by laches is a decision upon the merits, concluding the right of action.'\n\n See, also, People ex rel. Best v. Preston, 62 Hun, 185, 188, 189, 16 N. Y. Supp. 488; Black v. Miller, 75 Mich. 323, 329, 42 N. W. 837.\n Whether based on a plea of the statute of limitations or on a failure to prove substantive allegations of fact, therefore, \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 301]\n\u00a0\n the result of the judgment is the same, viz. that plaintiff has no case, and to hold that plaintiff may then invoke another and inconsistent remedy is not to recognize an exception to the general operation of the doctrine of election of remedies but to deny the doctrine altogether. Here, upon the facts as stated in the bill in equity and later in the action at law, both remedies were available to the plaintiff in error. In electing to sue in equity plaintiff in error proceeded with full knowledge of the facts, but it underestimated the strength of its cause, and if that were sufficient to warrant the bringing of a second and inconsistent action the result would be to confine the defense of election of remedies to cases where the first suit had been won by plaintiff and to deny it in all cases where plaintiff had lost. But the election was determined by the bringing and maintenance of the suit, not by the final disposition of the case by the court. See, for example, Bolton Mines Co. v. Stokes, 82 Md. 50, 59, 33 Atl. 491, 31 L. R. A. 789.\n The distinguishing feature of the instant case is that, after the coming in of the answer pleading the statute of limitations, and the plain warning thus conveyed of the danger of continuing the equity suit further, the plaintiff in error persisted in pursuing it to final judgment, instead of promptly reforming the cause or dismissing the bill and seeking the alternative remedy, not subject to the same defense. The doctrine of election of remedies and that of res adjudicata are not the same, but they have this is common: That each has for its underlying basis the maxim which forbids that one shall be twice vexed for one and the same cause. The policy embodied in this maxim we think requires us to hold that the plaintiff in error, in bringing the original suit, and in continuing after the plea in bar to follow it to a final determination, made an irrevocable election, and that it is now estopped from maintaining the present inconsistent action.\n Question No. 1 is somewhat ambiguous, but, taken in connection with the facts, it is clear that what the Circuit \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 302]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals desires to know is whether the action at law by the United States to recover the value of lands, the title to which was fraudulently obtained, is barred for the reason that the United States, with knowledge of the fraud, had previously prosecuted, upon the same facts, a suit in equity to final judgment of dismissal rendered on the ground that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations? This question we answer in the affirmative, and, as this disposes of the case, no answer to question No. 2 is required.\n It will be so certified.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice HOLMES concur.\n The general rule that statutes of limitation do not run against the United States often works hardship. The rule proved so oppressive when applied to proceedings to annual patents to land, that Congress erected for such suits the six-year bar. Act March 3, 1891, c. 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099 (Comp. St.  5114). In Exploration Co., Limited, v. United States, \n247 U.S. 435\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 571, the act was construed to mean that the 6 years do not begin to run until the cause of action is discovered. This statute did not in terms extend the bar to the government's remedy at law. United States v. Whited & Wheless, \n246 U.S. 552\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 367, held that the law gave two remedies to protect the single right, and that the act of 1891 left intact the remedy at law for deceit practiced in securing the patent. The court, therefore, permitted recovery at law, although the remedy in equity had been barred.\n The fraud here involved was practiced in connection with the acquisition of land patented in 1900. To obtain redress the government brought in 1912 a bill in equity to annual the patent. Defendants pleaded the statutory bar. The government might then have dismissed its bill; and if it had done so, it could then unquestionably have commenced \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 303]\n\u00a0\n an action at law for deceit. \n1\n Or the government might, under the act March 3, 1915, c. 90, 38 Stat. 956 (Comp. St.  1251a-1251c), and equity rule 22 (33 Sup. Ct. xxiv), have then had the case transferred to the law side of the court, and have thus freed itself from the possibility of a statutory bar. It did not do either. Instead, it proceeded to a hearing in the equity suit, presumably because it considered the legal remedy inadequate and believed that it could establish its right to pursue the equitable remedy by showing that the fraud had been discovered within the 6 years. In this the government proved to be mistaken. The court found that the United States had full knowledge of the matters complained of more than 6 years before the suit was begun, and for that reason could not have the relief sought in equity. Even then-after the adverse decision, but before entry of a decree-it was not too late to transfer the pending suit to the law side of the court, and to proceed there with the action for deceit. Such a transfer, after full hearing on the merits and a decision that relief in equity could not be had, was made without loss of any right in Friederichsen v. Renard, \n247 U.S. 207\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 450. But the government made no such application; the court entered a decree dismissing the bill; and no appeal was taken. Then, in 1918, the government brought the present action at law. The question now presented for decision is whether it had lost the right to do so.\n The thing adjudged in the equity case was solely that the fraud had been discovered by the government more than 6 years before the commencement of the suit, and that, for this reason, the patent could not be annulled. There was no adjudication of the government's substantive right. And since it had two remedies to protect that right, and the fact found is not a bar to an action at law, no suggestion is made that the decree of dismissal bars this action as res judicata. There is likewise no suggestion \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 304]\n\u00a0\n of an estoppel in pais. Nor is there a suggestion that by proceeding to a hearing in the equity suit, or by failing to ask that the case be transferred to the law side of the court, the government subjected defendants to any annoyance or expense, other than that necessarily incident to unproductive litigation. The remedy at law is denied solely on the ground that the socalled doctrine of election of remedies applies; that the government had two remedies; that the two remedies were inconsistent; that, when the statutory bar was pleaded in equity, the plaintiff was obliged at its peril to make a final choice between the two remedies; and that, since it selected the one which proved not to be available, it shall have no remedy whatsoever.\n The doctrine of election of remedies is not a rule of substantive law. It is a rule of procedure or judicial administration. It is technical, and, as applied in some jurisdictions, has often sacrificed substantial right to supposed legal consistency. \n2\n The doctrine has often been invoked in this court, but never before successfully. Its existence has been recognized; but in every case in which the question presented was actually one of election of remedies, this court held that the doctrine did not apply, giving as a reason that one or the other of its essential elements was absent. These essentials are that the party must have actually had two remedies and that the remedy in question must be inconsistent with the other previously invoked. Here neither of these essential elements was present.\n The government did not have a remedy in equity when the suit to annual the patent was begun or at any time thereafter. That this is true was established by the decree \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 305]\n\u00a0\n in the equity suit. The government's alleged choice of the equitable remedy was, therefore, 'not an election, but an hypothesis.' Northern Assurance Co. v. Grand View Building Association, \n203 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 27, 28 (51 L. Ed. 109); Wm. W. Bierce, Ltd., v. Hutchins, \n205 \nU.S. 340, 347\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 524. For 'it is impossible to conceive of a right of election in a case where no such right existed.' Friend v. Talcott, \n228 \nU.S. 27, 37\n, 38 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 505, 507 (57 L. Ed. 718). Thus the mere fact that the remedy first invoked was at the time unavailable precludes application of the doctrine. The reason why it was unavailable is immaterial. A party is equally free to try another remedy, whether the earlier proceeding was futile because of inability to establish assumed facts essential to the existence of the remedy then pursued or because the assumed facts did not as matter of law entitle him to the relief sought. \n3\n In the Northern Assurance Case, supra, the earlier action at law was held not to be an election, because the facts there relied on could not be proved. In the Bierce Case, supra, filing an earlier lien suit was held not to be an election, because one cannot have a lien on one's own property. In Friederichsen v. Renard, supra, suing to set aside the conveyance was not an election, because the right to rescind had been lost. In Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, \n250 \nU.S. 483, 490\n, 491 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 533, the earlier unsuccessful suits were not an election, because facts there essential could not be established. So, in the case at bar, because the equitable remedy, theretofore invoked was not in fact available to the government, its right to proceed \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 306]\n\u00a0\n at law was not lost, under the doctrine of election of remedies. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover, an action at law for deceit is not inconsistent with a prior unsuccessful suit to annul the patent. This case must not be confused with those in which it has been held that a prior action at law on a contract, or other proceeding arising out of it, bars a later suit to rescind, as where an action on a purchase money note has been held to bar a later suit by the vendor to set aside the conveyance for fraud. There the reason why the conveyance cannot be set aside is that by suing at law the vendor exercises his option to affirm the voidable transaction, and cannot thereafter disaffirm it. In so doing he makes a choice of substantive rights. But where the vendor's first attempt to obtain redress was by way of rescission, and there was in fact then no right to rescind, his substantive rights have not been changed. \n5\n This is the situation presented in the case at bar. The government said, in effect:\n'We wish to rescind and get back the land; but if the facts or the law are such that we cannot rescind, then we wish to recover damages for the deceit.'\n\n Certainly that is not taking inconsistent positions. See United States v. Whited & Wheless, supra, \n246 \nU.S. 562, 564\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 367. Indeed, an action for damages might be permissible as a supplemental remedy, even if the equitable relief had been granted. \n6\n For annulling the patent may fail to give the government \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 307]\n\u00a0\n full relief. The land may have been stripped, meanwhile, of its trees or its mineral, or the deceit may have involved the government in expenses which are recoverable. It is true that under such circumstances equity, if it annulled the patent, would probably retain the cause to award recovery for all damages as suffered. But it might leave the vendor to his remedy at law; and conversely the vendor might, if he chose, limit his suit in equity to the recovery of the property. In either event he could recover his damages at law. Compare Brady v. Daly, \n175 \nU.S. 148, 161\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 62; Thomas v. Sugarman, \n218 U.S. 129\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 650, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 250; Zimmerman v. Harding, \n227 \nU.S. 489, 493\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 387. There is, therefore, lacking here inconsistency of remedies; and for that reason, also, the doctrine of election of remedies does not apply.\n There are some cases in this court, earlier than those discussed above, in which the doctrine of election of remedies was referred to when denying the relief sought. But in those cases, of which Robb v. Vos, \n155 U.S. 13\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 4, is an example, relief was not denied because of a previous election of an inconsistent remedy. The party failed because he had theretofore made a choice of an alternative substantive right, as where one by his conduct ratifies and makes valid an unauthorized transaction otherwise void. In such cases the mere fact that the conduct relied upon consisted, in whole, or in part, of legal proceedings, is of no legal significance in this connection. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[260 U.S. 290, 308]\n\u00a0\n Because the government had, as now appears, no remedy except the action at law for deceit, and also because this remedy is not inconsistent with an earlier vain attempt to rescind, a denial of the right to prosecute the present action cannot, consistently with the earlier decisions of this court, rest upon the doctrine of election of remedies. Support for the denial is sought in the fact that the government did not abandon its futile attempt to annul the patent, when it was advised by the defendants' answer that they proposed to rely upon the statutory bar. But it is well settled that a party may disregard such a warning. If he deems it doubtful which one of several possible courses will lead to relief, he may (even where the courses are inconsistent) follow one to defeat, and still pursue thereafter another remedy until he ultimately finds the one which will afford him redress, provided always that the facts do not create an equitable estoppel. \n8\n There is, of course, no suggestion here that the \n\n[260 U.S. 290, 309]\n\u00a0\n government acted in bad faith in refusing to abandon the equitable remedy until the trial court had decided the issue of knowledge against it. The government gained nothing, the defendants lost nothing, by the bringing of the futile suit in equity to annul the patent. However stupid or stubborn a party may have been, he is not deprived of the right to try another remedy; for, whatever the cause of his earlier futile attempt, his failure proves him to have been mistaken. To hold that this action for deceit is barred, because the government did not dismiss the earlier equity suit when it was advised by the answer that the statutory bar would be relied on, lays down a rule new in this court-a rule inconsistent with the principles heretofore established, and opposed to a long line of well considered decisions in state courts. To do this seems to me regrettable. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Bistline v. United States, 229 Fed. 546, 144 C. C.

In Van Winkle v. Crowell, \n146 \nU.S. 42, 51\n, 13 S. Sup.

WILSON(1922)\nNo. 132\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 108]\n\u00a0\n Frederick S. Lyon and A. V. Andrews, both of Los Angeles, Cal., Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., and William K. White, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. G. Benton Wilson, of Los Angeles, Cal., and F. W. Clements, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Wilson sued the Union Tool Company in the federal court for the Southern district of California, Southern division, for infringement of a patent for underreamers. He obtained a decree for an injunction and an accounting (237 Fed. 847), which was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (249 Fed. 736, 161 C. C. A. 646), and a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by this court (\n248 U.S. 559\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 6). Thereafter a writ of injunction issued, which forbade the manufacture and sale, not only of infringing machines, but also of parts or elements that might be used in combination to effect infringement. \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n Wilson claimed that there had been deliberate violation of the injunction, both by the sale of infringing machines and by the sale of spare parts, and he moved in the District Court that the company and certain of its officers be punished for contempt or otherwise dealt with for violating it. The District Court found that, since the service of the injunction, the company had sold infringing machines, held it guilty of contempt in so doing, ordered that the company pay to the clerk of the court $5,000 as a fine, and that out of this sum $2,500 be paid to Wilson 'as a reasonable portion of the expenses incurred' by him in the contempt proceeding, and further ordered that, if the fine were not paid within 20 days, Double, the company's president, be committed to jail, to be there confined until it should be paid. The District Court also found that the company had sold, after the service of the injunction, spare parts to be used with machines or devices sold by the company prior thereto, and that these were of such a nature that when used in combination they would effect an infringement. But the court concluded, for reasons to be stated, that the sale of such spare parts should not subject the company to a fine, and purged it of contempt in that respect, without prejudice to the right of Wilson to renew his application.\n To have this judgment entered in the contempt proceeding reviewed by the Court of Appeals, the company and Double sued out a writ of error, and thereafter Wilson sued out a cross-writ of error. The two writs were considered and disposed of separately. On the original writ the judgment was modified by striking out all that related to Double, and it was reversed in so far as it 'directed that $2,500 be paid to the clerk of the court as a punishment of the corporation.' But in so far as the judgment directed payment to Wilson as compensation, it was affirmed. 262 Fed. 431. On the cross-writ, which was heard and decided later, the Court of Appeals \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n overruled a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, held the company guilty of contempt in selling the spare parts, held that the District Court had abused its discretion in purging the company of this contempt, reversed, in that respect, the judgment, and remanded it, with directions to the District Court to impose such punishment as might seem proper. 265 Fed. 669. A motion of the company for leave to file a petition for mandamus to compel the Court of Appeals to vacate its judgment on the cross-writ of error and to dismiss the latter was denied by this court. \n254 U.S. 608\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 12. But a petition for a writ of certiorari was granted to review the reversal of the judgment in so far as it purged petitioner of contempt in selling the spare parts. \n254 U.S. 624\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 14. And it is that alone which is now here for review.\n The contention that the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction of the cross-writ of error is renewed here. It is argued that the judgment for contempt, so far as now sought to be reviewed, is remedial, not punitive; that being remedial, it can be reviewed only on appeal, and not on writ of error; that an appeal will not lie until after the final decree; and that no final decree had been entered, as the accounting was still in process. It is true that the part of the judgment for contempt now under review is remedial. But it does not follow that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review it on the cross-writ of error. The District Court entered a single order, part remedial, part punitive. Where a fine is imposed, partly as compensation to the complainant and partly as punishment, the criminal feature of the order is dominant and fixes its character for purposes of review. In re Merchants' Stock Co., Petitioner, \n223 U.S. 639\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 339. If the company had acquiesced in the judgment entered, Wilson, having no right to initiate a review of the punitive part, could not have instituted any appellate proceeding until after final decree. Matter of Christensen Engineering Co., 194 \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 458, 24 Sup. Ct. 729; Doyle v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., Limited, \n204 U.S. 599\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 313. See also Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117, 122\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 356. But an order punishing one criminally for contempt, is a final judgment The contemnor may obtain immediately a review by writ of error. Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 U.S. 324\n, 336-338, 24 Sup. Ct. 665. And the company availed itself of this right. When the order was thus brought before the Court of Appeals, it acquired, at the company's instance, jurisdiction to review that part which was civil as well as that which was criminal in its nature. In the exercise of that jurisdiction it granted, in respect to Double, relief which affected both the criminal and the civil parts of the order. If a cross-writ of error had not been filed, Wilson could not have secured from the Court of Appeals relief in respect to that part of the order which was unfavorable to him. Bolles v. Outing Co., \n175 \nU.S. 262, 268\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 94. But a cross-writ was duly filed, and that enabled the court to review the portion of the order, civil in its nature, which Wilson alleged to be erroneous; for the judgment in the contempt proceeding was a unit. The case resembles in some respects Mayer v. Walsh, \n108 U.S. 17\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 417; Walsh v. Mayer, \n111 \nU.S. 31, 37\n, 38 S., 4 Sup. Ct. 260. Compare Field v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n194 \nU.S. 618, 620\n, 621 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 784. The facts relating to the sale of spare parts were agreed, and the question before the court was merely as to their legal effect. That question could appropriately be considered on cross-writ of error-even without resort to the power conferred by section 4 of the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1649a ). Cases like Ex parte National Enameling Co., \n201 U.S. 156\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 404, and Farrar v. Churchill, \n135 U.S. 609\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 771, relied upon by the company, are not applicable.\n The company contends also that the judgment of the District Court, being favorable to it in so far as it related to spare parts, was not subject to review by any appellate court, at any time, by any proceeding- although remedial \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 112]\n\u00a0\n in its nature. The argument is that where the court of whose authority contempt is charged either finds that there was no contempt or purges the offender, a judicial power has been exercised which is discretionary and is not subject to review. But the fact that a remedial order was entered in a contempt proceeding is not in itself a reason why it should not be subject to correction by an appellate court. In Worden v. Searls, \n121 \nU.S. 14, 26\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 814, such an order granting compensation was reversed by this court, and in the Court of Appeals like orders of the District Court denying compensation have been reviewed. Enoch Morgan's Sons Co. v. Gibson, 122 Fed. 420, 59 C. C. A. 46; L. E. Waterman Co. v. Standard Drug Co., 202 Fed. 167, 120 C. C. A. 455. In the determination of the question whether an injunction has been violated and, if so, whether compensation shall be made to the injured party, there may be occasion for the exercise of judicial discretion; but the order to be entered in such a proceeding is not exclusively or necessarily a discretionary one. See Christensen Engineering Co. v. Westinghouse Co., 135 Fed. 774, 68 C. C. A. 476; Gordon v. Turco-Halvah Co., 247 Fed. 487, 159 C. C. A. 541. Moreover, legal discretion in such a case does not extend to a refusal to apply well- settled principles of law to a conceded state of facts. See Winchester Repeating Arms Co. v. Olmsted, 203 Fed. 493, 494, 121 C. C. A. 615; In re Sobol, 242 Fed. 487, 489, 155 C. C. A. 263.\n Minor objections of a procedural nature are also urged It is said that while the infringement by sale of spare parts was a civil contempt, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court 'to impose such punishment as may seem proper' and thus ordered criminal punishment. In view of the opinion and other proceedings, the direction must be understood as referring to compensation. Compare Gompers. v. Bucks Stove Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 441\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S .) 874. Then it is insisted that the writ of injunction, although properly attested by the clerk of the District Court, was void and of no effect because it bears teste of \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 113]\n\u00a0\n the late Chief Justice of the United States, whereas by section 911 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1534) it should have borne teste of the District Judge. Under that section writs from the Circuit Courts bore teste of the Chief Justice; and since the transfer of their jurisdiction to the District Courts writs from them may be properly tested by the Chief Justice. See Judicial Code,  289, 291 (Comp. St.  1266, 1268). But the company is in no position to make the objection. Knowing of the injunction, it would have been bound to obey it even if no writ had issued. In re Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548, 554\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 658. Moreover, the objection to the teste of the writ is made, so far as appears, for the first time, in the brief filed by petitioner in this court. Compare District of Columbia v. Brooke, \n214 \nU.S. 138, 147\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 560.\n On the merits the contention is this: The interlocutory decree awards to Wilson, among other things, compensation by way of damages and profits, for employing the invention in any machine sold prior to the service of the injunction. A patentee, in demanding and receiving full compensation for the wrongful use of his invention in devices made and sold by a manufacturer adopts the sales as though made by himself, and therefore necessarily licenses the use of the devices, and frees them from the monopoly of the patent. This license continues during the life of the machine; it does not end when repairs become necessary. Spare parts are needed for repairs. Those here in question were sold for use in, and repair of, machines marketed by the company before the service of the injunction. Therefore, it is argued, the sale of these parts is licensed and thus not a violation of the injunction. But to this argument which prevailed in the District Court, there are several answers; and, among them, this. It does not appear that Wilson has received any compensation whatever for the infringement by use of these machines. Compare Birdsell v. Shaliol, 112 U. S. \n\n[259 U.S. 107, 114]\n\u00a0\n 485, 487-489, 5 Sup. Ct. 244. There was, consequently, no implied license to use the spare parts in these machines. As such use, unless licensed, clearly constituted an infringement, the sale of the spare parts to be so used violated the injunction. And the sale having been made with full knowledge of all relevant facts the Court of Appeals properly held that, so far as Wilson had sought remedial, as distinguished from punitive action, the District Court was not justified in purging the petitioner of contempt arising from the sale of spare parts.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION TRUST CO. OF SAN FRANCISCO v. WARDELL(1922)\nNo. 236\nArgued: Decided: May 1, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Garret W. McEnerney, Edward F. Treadwell, and Sidney M. Ehrman, all of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for defendants in error. \n\n[258 U.S. 537, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was argued at the same time and submitted with No. 200, Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 U.S. 529\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 391, 66 L. Ed. --, just decided. It involves, as that case did, the Estate Tax Act of September 8, 1916 ( Comp. St.  6336 1\/2 a-6336 1\/2 m), and its different facts illustrate and aid the principle upon which that case was decided.\n Plaintiffs in error are executors of the last will and testament of Henriette S. Lachman, deceased. They were also parties to a trust deed made by her during her lifetime. They sued defendant in error Wardell, he then being United States Collector of Internal Revenue for the First District of California, to recover the sum of $4,545.50; that being the amount of a tax assessed against the estate of Henriette S. Lachman, upon the value of 4,895 shares of stock transferred in trust by Henriette S. Lachman to trustees, upon the assumption that the Act of Congress of September 8, 1916, was applicable to the trust.\n The following is a summary of the facts stated narratively:\n On May 31, 1901, Henriette S. Lachman was the owner of 7,475 shares of the capital stock of the S. & H. Lachman Estate, a corporation. On that date she executed and delivered to Albert Lachman and Henry Lachman, her sons, the following instrument:\n'Alameda, Cal., May 31, 1901\n\n\n\n'To Albert Lachman and Henry Lachman, My Sons:\n\n'This is to certify that I have delivered to you seven thousand four hundred and seventyfive (7,475) shares of \n\n[258 U.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n the capital stock of the S. & H. Lachman Estate, represented by certificates numbers eleven (11), twelve (12), and thirteen (13) respectively, however, upon the following trust:\n\n'To pay to me during my lifetime, all the income earned and derived therefrom, and, upon my death, to deliver two thousand four hundred and ninety (2,490) shares, respectively by certificate number eleven ( 11) unto Henry Lachman, thenceforth for his absolute property; two thousand four hundred and ninety-five (2,495) shares, represented by certificate number thirteen (13) unto Albert Lachman, thenceforth for his absolute property; and yourselves, to wit, Albert Lachman and Henry Lachman, to hold two thousand four hundred and ninety (2,490) shares, represented by certificate number twelve (12) upon my death, in trust paying the income derived therefrom unto my daughter, Rebecca, wife of Leo Metzger, and upon the death of my said daughter, the income and earnings derived from said two thousand four hundred and ninety (2,490) shares shall be held, or expended, by you, according to your judgment, for the benefit of my grandchildren, the children of my said daughter, Rebecca Metzger, and upon the youngest of said children attaining the age of majority, all the then surviving children of my said daughter, Rebecca Metzger, shall be immediately entitled to said two thousand four hundred and ninety (2, 490) shares in equal proportions.\n\n'Henriette Lachman.'\n\n The requirements of the deed were performed upon the contingencies occurring for which it provided.\n On November 14, 1916, Henriette S. Lachman died, being then a resident of Alameda county, Cal., leaving an estate of the value of $302, 963.64, which included 2,490 shares of the stock that passed to her upon the death of her husband and 25 shares of stock in a business that had been conducted by her husband, but did not include the transfer of the 4, 985 shares included in the trust deed. \n\n[258 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n The will was duly probated, and the tax under the Act of September 8, 1916, was paid on the property which passed under her will, but no tax was paid on the 4,985 shares transferred 15 years before by the trust deed.\n The Commissioner, having ruled that those shares were subject to a tax, assessed against them the sum of $4,545.50. It was paid under protest and this action was brought for its recovery.\n Wardell demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him. The demurrer was sustained and judgment entered dismissing the complaint.\n Stating the contention of the plaintiffs, the court said it was that:\n'The act should not be so construed as to include transfers made prior to its passage, and that if it be so construed the act is unconstitutional.'\n\n The court observed that:\n'Both of these questions were determined adversely to the plaintiffs by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Schwab, Executor, v. Doyle, 269 Fed. 321.'\n\n And said further:\n'In that case the transfer was made in contemplation of death, whereas in the present case the transfer was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, but manifestly the same rule of construction will apply to both provisions, and the same rule of constitutional validity.' 273 Fed. 733.\n\n The court, while apparently relying on Schwab v. Doyle, declared that it entertained--\n'no doubt that the act was intended to operate retrospectively, and a contrary construction could only be justified on the principle that such a construction would render the act unconstitutional.'\n\n The same contentions are made against and for the ruling of the court as were made in Shwab v. Doyle. It is not necessary to repeat them. They are, with but verbal variations, the same as in Shwab v. Doyle, \n\n[258 U.S. 537, 541]\n\u00a0\n and the collector so considering, submits this case upon the brief in that.\n We have there stated them and passed judgment upon that which we think determines the case; that is, the retroactivity of the Act of September 8, 1916. The facts in this case fortify the reasoning in that. In this case the act is given operation against an instrument executed 15 years before the passage of the act.\n The record exhibits proceedings that should be noticed. The demurrer of Wardell was sustained to the complaint, and a judgment of dismissal entered January 13, 1921.\n On February 2, 1921, plaintiffs gave notice of a motion to substitute John S. Flynn as defendant in the place and stead of Wardell in so far as the action was against Wardell in his official capacity, and to permit it to be continued and prosecuted against him so far as it was against him personally.\n The grounds of the motion were stated to be that he had resigned and Flynn had been appointed his successor and was then the acting collector.\n On February 7, 1921, the motion was granted. The order of the court recited the resignation of Wardell and the succession of Flynn. And it being uncertain as to whether this was a proper case for the substitution of Flynn or was one which should proceed against Wardell, and it appearing to the court on motion of plaintiffs that it was necessary for the survivor to obtain a settlement of the questions involved, it was ordered that so far as the action was against Wardell in his official capacity, it might be sustained against Flynn as his successor, and that so far as it was against Wardell personally, it should be continued against him. And it was ordered that the action should thereafter proceed against Flynn and Wardell without further pleadings or process.\n On February 9, 1921, Flynn filed an appearance by attorneys which recited that he had been substituted in \n\n[258 U.S. 537, 542]\n\u00a0\n the place of Wardell in so far as the action was against Wardell in his official capacity, and thereby appeared in the action as such defendant.\n It will be observed that there was no resistance to the motion of substitution of Flynn, nor exception by him, and that he almost immediately appeared in the action in compliance with the order of the court. The subsequent proceedings were directed as much against him as against Wardell, the bond upon the writ of error running to both.\n However, this court decided in Smietanka, Collector v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 U.S. 1\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 1, October 24th of this term, that a suit may not be brought against a collector of internal revenue for the recovery of a tax, in the collection and disbursement of which, such officer had no agency. We think the bringing of Flynn into the case was error. Therefore, upon the return of the case to the District Court, he shall be permitted to set up the defense of nonliability, if he be so advised, and, if he set up the defense, it shall be ruled as sufficient for the reasons we have given.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA v. CORONADO COAL CO.(1922)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n Coal Co. \n259 U.S. 344\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[259 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n This is a writ of error brought under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218) to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit. That court on a writ of error had affirmed the judgment of the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, in favor of the plaintiffs, with some modification, and that judgment thus affirmed is here for review.\n The plaintiffs in the District Court were the receivers of the Bache- Denman Coal Company, with eight other corporations, in each of which the first-named company owned a controlling amount of stock. They were closely interrelated in corporate organization and in the physical location of their coal mines. These had been operated for some years as a unit under one set of officers in the Prairie Creek valley in Sebastian county, Ark. In July, 1914, the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas appointed a receiver for all of the nine companies by a single decree. The receiver then appointed \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n was Franklin Bache, whose successors are as such defendants in error here.\n The defendants in the court below were the United Mine Workers of America and its officers, District 21 of the United Mine Workers of America and its officers, 27 local unions in District No. 21 and their officers, and 65 individuals, mostly members of one union or another, but including some persons not members, all of whom were charged in the complaint with having entered into a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce, in violation of the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8820, 8821), and with having, in the course of that conspiracy, and for the purpose of consummating it, destroyed the plaintiff's properties. Treble damages for this and an attorney's fee were asked under the seventh section of the act (Comp. St.  8829).\n The original complaint was filed in September, 1914, about six weeks after the destruction of the property. It was demurred to, and the District Court sustained the demurrer. This was carried to the Court of Appeals on error, and the ruling of the District Court was reversed. Dowd v. Inited Mine Workers, 235 Fed. 1, 148 C. C. A. 495. The case then came to trial on the third amended complaint and answers of the defendants. The trial resulted in a verdict of $200,000 for the plaintiffs, which was trebled by the court, and to which was added a counsel fee of $25,000, and interest to the amount of $120,600, from July 17, 1914, the date of the destruction of the property, to November 22, 1917, the date upon which judgment was entered. The verdict did not separate the amount found between the companies. On a writ of error from the Court of Appeals, the case was reversed as to the interest, but in other respects the judgment was affirmed. 258 Fed. 829. The defendants the International Union and District No. 21 have given a supersedeas bond to meet the judgment, if it is affirmed as against both or either of them. \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n The third amended complaint avers that of the nine companies, of which the plaintiff was receiver, and for which he was bringing his suit, five were operating companies engaged in mining coal and shipping it in interstate commerce, employing in all about 870 men, and mining an annual product when working to their capacity valued at $465,000, of which 75 per cent. was sold and shipped to customers outside of the state. Of the five operating companies, one was under contract to operate the properties of two of the others, and four nonoperating companies were each financially interested in one or more of the operating companies, either by lease, by contract, or by the ownership of all or a majority of their stock. The defendant the United Mine Workers of America is alleged to be an unincorporated association of mine workers, governed by a constitution, with a membership exceeding 400,000, subdivided into 30 districts and numerous local unions. These subordinate districts and unions are subject to the constituttion and by-laws, not only of the International Union, but also to constitutions of their own.\n The complaint avers that the United Mine Workers divide all coal mines into two classes, union or organized mines, operating under a contract with the union to employ only union miners, and open shop or nonunion mines, which refuse to make such a contract; that, owing to the unreasonable restrictions and regulations imposed by the union on organized mines, the cost of production of union coal is unnecessarily enhanced, so as to prevent its successful competition in the markets of the country with nonunion coal; that the object of the conspiracy of the United Mine Workers and the union operators acting with them is the protection of the union-mined coal by the prevention and restraint of all interstate trade and competition in the products of nonunion mines. The complaint enumerates 23 states in which coal \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n mining is conducted, and alleges that the coal mined in each comes into competition in interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, with that mined in Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, in the markets of Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota, where, but for the defendants' unlawful interference, plaintiffs would have been engaged in trade in 1914; that the bituminous mines of the greater part of the above territory are union mines, the principal exceptions being Alabama, West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania, and Colorado, which the defendant has thus far been unable to organize.\n The complaint further avers that early in 1914 the plaintiff companies decided that the operating companies should go on a nonunion or open shop basis. Two of them, the Prairie Creek Coal Mining Company and the Mammoth Vein Coal Company, closed down and discontinued as union mines, preparatory to reopening as open shop mines in April. They were to be operated under a new contract by the Mammoth Vein Coal Mining Company. Another of the companies, the Hartford Coal Company, which had not been in operation, planned to start as an open shop mine as soon as convenient in the summer of 1914. The fifth, the Coronado Coal Company, continued operating with the union until April 18, 1914, when its employes struck because of its unity of interest with the other mines of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs say that in April, 1914, the defendants and those acting in conjunction with them, in furtherance of the general conspiracy, already described, to drive nonunion coal out of interstate commerce, and thus to protect union operators from nonunion competition, drove and frightened away with plaintiffs' employees, including those directly engaged in shipping coal to other states, prevented the plaintiffs from employing other men, destroyed the structures and facilities for mining, loading, and shipping coal, and the \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n cars of interstate carriers waiting to be loaded, as well as those already loaded with coal in and for interstate shipment, and prevented plaintiffs from engaging in or continuing to engage in interstate commerce. The complaint alleges that the destruction to the property in business amounted to the sum of $740,000, and asks judgment for three times that amount, or $2,220,000. Certain of the funds of the United Mine Workers in Arkansas were attached. The defendants the United Mine Workers of America, District No. 21, and each local union, and each individual defendant filed a separate answer. The answers deny all the averments of the complaint. The trial began on October 24, 1917, and a verdict and judgment were entered on November 22, following. The evidence is very voluminous, covering more than 3,000 printed pages.\n Messrs. Wm. A. Glasgow, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., G. L. Grant, of Ft. Smith, Ark., Henry Warrum, of Indianapolis, Ind., Webb Covington, of Ft. Smith, Ark., and Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 344, 364]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., and James B. McDonough, of Ft. Smith, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 344, 376]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Daniel Davenport, of Bridgeport, Conn., Walter Gordon Merritt, of New York City, and Thomas Hewes, of Hartford, Conn., amici curiae.\n\n\n[259 U.S. 344, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n There are five principal questions pressed by the plaintiffs in error here, the defendants below. The first is that there was a misjoinder of parties plaintiff. The second is that the United Mine Workers of America, District No. 21, United Mine Workers of America, and the local unions made defendants, are unincorporated associations and not subject to suit, and therefore should have been dismissed from the case on motions seasonably made. The third is that there is no evidence to show any agency by the \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 382]\n\u00a0\n United Mine Workers of America in the conspiracy charged, or in the actual destruction of the property, and no liability therefor. The fourth is that there is no evidence to show that the conspiracy alleged against District No. 21 and the other defendants was a conspiracy to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce. The fifth is that the court erred in a supplemental charge to the jury, which so stated the court's view of the evidence as to amount to a mandatory direction coercing the jury into finding the verdict which was recorded.\n First. It does not seem to us that there was a misjoinder of parties under the procedure as authorized in Arkansas. In that state the law provides that when causes of action of a like nature, or relative to the same question, are pending before any of its circuit or chancery courts, the court may make such orders and rules regulating proceedings therein as may be conformable to the usages of courts for avoiding unnecessary costs or delay in the administration of justice, and may consolidate said causes when it appears reasonable to do so. In Southern Anthracite Coal Co. v. Bowen, 93 Ark. 140, 124 S. W. 1048, the court consolidated, over objection by defendant, two suits by two workmen who had been injured in the same accident, and the Supreme Court approved of this action. In Fidelity Insurance Co. v. Friedman, 117 Ark. 71, 174 S. W. 215, it was held that actions by an injured person and by a mortgagee against eight insurance companies on eight different fire insurance policies could be consolidated against the objection by defendants, and they were tried together. Of course, the application of this rule of the Arkansas courts under the federal Conformity Act (Comp. St.  1537), will be qualified to prevent injury to any substantial right secured by federal law in the trial. It is a case for the exercise of reasonable discretion by the trial court. We cannot say that that discretion was abused in this case. All the companies for which the plaintiffs herein are receivers were united together in interest \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 383]\n\u00a0\n and largely under the control of one of the companies. The active manager of all of them for years was Franklin Bache. He was the first receiver, and as such the plaintiff. There was no need for a division in the verdict of damages found, because the union of interest between the plaintiffs involved no difficulty in the distribution among them of the amount found. The judgment is res adjudicata as to all the plaintiffs, and we can find no substantial reason for disturbing it on this ground. No difficulty presented itself with respect to the challenge of jurors by either side, and so far as appears there was no embarrassment to the defendants growing out of the union of the plaintiffs. On the contrary, an examination of the evidence shows that all the witnesses for the defendants treated the plaintiffs as a unit. They were so regarded in business and in the neighborhood where the mines were.\n Second. Were the unincorporated associations, the International Union, District No. 21, and the local unions, suable in their names? The United Mine Workers of America is a national organization. Indeed, because it embraces Canada, it is called the International Union. Under its constitution, it is intended to be the union of all workmen employed in and around coal mines, coal washers, and coke ovens on the American continent. Its declared purpose is to increase wages and improve conditions of employment of its members by legislation, conciliation, joint agreements, and strikes. It demands not more than eight hours a day of labor. The union is composed of workmen eligible to membership, and is divided into districts, subdistricts, and local unions. The ultimate authority is a general convention to which delegates selected by the members in their local organizations are elected. The body governing the union in the interval between conventions is the International Board, consisting of the principal officers, the president, vice president and secretary-treasurer together with a member from \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 384]\n\u00a0\n each district. The president has much power. He can remove or suspend International officers, appoints the national organizers and subordinates, and is to interpret authoritatively the constitution, subject to reversal by the International Board. When the Board is not in session, the individual members are to do what he directs them to do. He may dispense with initiation fees for admission of new locals and members. The machinery of the organization is directed largely toward propaganda, conciliation of labor disputes, the making of scale agreements with operators, the discipline of officers, members, districts, and locals, and toward strikes and the maintenance of funds for that purpose. It is admirably framed for unit action under the direction of the national officers. It has a weekly journal, whose editor is appointed by the president, which publishes all official orders and circulars, and all the union news. Each local union is required to be a subscriber, and its official notices are to be brought by the secretary to the attention of the members. The initiation fees and dues collected from each member are divided between the national treasury, the district treasury, and that of the local. Should a local dissolve, the money is to be transmitted to the national treasury.\n The rules as to strikes are important here. Section 27 of the constitution is as follows:\n'The Board shall have power between conventions, by a two-thirds vote, to recommend the calling of a general strike, but under no circumstances shall it call such strike until approved by a referendum vote of the members.'\n\n Under article 16, no district is permitted to engage in a strike involving all or a major portion of its members without sanction of the International Convention or Board.\n Section 2 of that article provides that districts may order local strikes within their respective districts 'on \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 385]\n\u00a0\n their own responsibility,' but where local strikes are to be financed by the International Union they must be sanctioned by the International Board.\n Section 3 provides that in unorganized fields the Convention or Board must sanction strikes, and no financial aid is to be given until after the strike has lasted four weeks, unless otherwise decided by the Board. The Board is to prescribe conditions in which strikes are to be financed by the International Union and the amount of strike relief to be furnished the striking members. In such cases, the president appoints a financial agent to assume responsibility for money to be expended from the International funds, and he only can make binding contracts. There is a uniform system of accounting as to the disbursements for strikes.\n The membership of the union has reached 450,000. The dues received from them for the national and district organizations make a very large annual total, and the obligations assumed in traveling expenses, holding of conventions, and general overhead cost, but most of all in strikes, are so heavy that an extensive financial business is carried on, money is borrowed, notes are given to banks, and in every way the union acts as a business entity, distinct from its members. No organized corporation has greater unity of action, and in none is more power centered in the governing executive bodies.\n Undoubtedly at common law an unincorporated association of persons was not recognized as having any other character than a partnership in whatever was done, and it could only sue or be sued in the names of its members, and their liability had to be enforced against each member. Pickett v. Walsh, 192 Mass. 572, 78 N. E. 753, 6 L. R. A (N. S.) 1067, 116 Am. St. Rep. 272, 7 Ann. Cas. 638; Karges Furniture Co. v. Amalga mated Woodworkers Local Union, 165 Ind. 421, 75 N. E. 877, 2 L. R. A. (N. S.) 788, 6 Ann. Cas. 829; Baskins v. United Mine Workers (Ark.) 234 S. W. 464, decided Nov. 7, 1921. But the growth and necessities of these great labor organizations have brought affirmative legal recognition of their \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 386]\n\u00a0\n existence and usefulness and provisions for their protection, which their members have found necessary. Their right to maintain strikes when they do not violate law or the rights of others, has been declared. The embezzlement of funds by their officers has been especially denounced as a crime. The so-called union label, which is a quasi trade-mark to indicate the origin of manufactured product in union labor, has been protected against pirating and deceptive use by the statutes of most of the states, and in many states authority to sue to enjoin its use has been conferred on unions. They have been given distinct and separate representation and the right to appear to represent union interests in statutory arbitrations, and before official labor boards. We insert in the margin an extended reference,1 furnished by the industry of counsel, to \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 387]\n\u00a0\n legislation of this kind. More than this, equitable procedure adapting itself to modern needs has grown to recognize the need of representation by one person of many, too numerous to sue or to be sued (Story, Equity Pleadings [8th Ed.]  94, 97; St. Germain v. Bakery Union, 97 Wash. 282, 166 Pac. 665, L. R. A. 1917F, 824; Branson v. Industrial Workers of the World, 30 Nev. 270, 95 Pac. 354; Barnes v. Chicago Typographical Union, 232 Ill. 402, 83 N. E. 932, 14 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1150, 122 Am. St. Rep. 129 ); and this has had its influence upon the law side of litigation, so that out of the very necessities of the existing conditions and the utter impossibility of doing justice otherwise, the suable character of such an organization as this has come to be recognized in some jurisdictions, and many suits for and against labor unions are reported, in which no question has been raised as to the right to treat them in their closely united \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 388]\n\u00a0\n action and functions as artificial persons capable of suing and being sued. It would be unfortunate if an organization with as great power as this International Union has in the raising of large funds and in directing the conduct of 400,000 members in carrying on, in a wide territory, industrial controversies, and strikes out of which so much unlawful injury to private rights is possible,\n___ California-Acts 1909, c. 331.

To remand persons injured to a suit against each of the 400,000 members, to recover damages and to levy on his share of the strike fund, would be to leave them remediless. \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 390]\n\u00a0\n In the case of Taff Vale Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 1901]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 426, an English statute provided for the registration of trades unions, authorized them to hold property through trustees, to have agents, and provided for a winding up and a rendering of accounts. A union was sued for damages growing out of a strike. Mr. Justice Farwell, meeting the objection that the union was not a corporation and could not be sued as an artificial person, said:\n'If the contention of the defendant society were well founded, the Legislature has authorized the creation of numerous bodies of men capable of owning great wealth and of action by agents with absolutely no responsibility for the wrongs that they may do to other persons by the use of that wealth and the employment of those agents.'\n\n He therefore gave judgment against the union. This was affirmed by the House of Lords. The legislation in question in that case did not create trade unions, but simply recognized their existence and regulated them in certain ways, but neither conferred on them general power to sue nor imposed liability to be sued. See also Hillenbrand v. Building Trade Council, 14 Ohio Dec. N. P. 628; Holland Jurisprudence (12th Ed.) 341; Pollock's First Book on Jurisprudence (2d Ed.) 125.\n Though such a conclusion as to the suability of trades unions is of primary importance in the working out of justice and in protecting individuals and society from possibility of oppression and injury in their lawful rights from the existence of such powerful entities as trade unions, it is after all in essence and principle merely a procedural matter. As a matter of substantive law, all the members of the union engaged in a combination doing unlawful injury are liable to suit and recovery, and the only question is whether when they have voluntarily, and for the purpose of acquiring concentrated strength and the faculty of quick unit action and elasticity, created a self-acting \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 391]\n\u00a0\n body with great funds to accomplish their purpose, they may not be sued as this body, and the funds they have accumulated may not be made to satisfy claims for injuries unlawfully caused in carrying out their united purpose. Trade unions have been recognized as lawful by the Clayton Act; they have been tendered formal incorporation as national unions by the Act of Congress approved June 29, 1886 (24 Stat. 86 [Comp. St.  8908-8912]). In the Act of Congress approved August 23, 1912 (37 Stat. 415 [Comp. St.  8913-8917]), a commission on industrial relations was created, providing that three of the Commissioners should represent organized labor. Transportation Act 1920,  302-307 (41 Stat. 469), recognizes labor unions in creation of railroad boards of adjustment, and provides for action by the Railroad Labor Board upon their application. The Act of Congress approved August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 112, and the Act approved October 3, 1913, c. 16, subd. G, (a) ( 38 Stat. 172), expressly exempt labor unions from excise taxes. Periodical publications issued by or under the auspices of trades unions are admitted into the mails as second-class mail matter. Acts 1911-1913, c. 389 (37 Stat. 550 [Comp. St.  7309]). The legality of labor unions of postal employees is expressly recognized by Act of Congress approved August 24, 1912, c. 389,  6 (37 Stat. 539, 555 [Comp. St.  3287]). By Act of Congress passed August 1, 1914, no money was to be used from funds therein appropriated to prosecute unions under the Anti-Trust Act (38 Stat. 609, 652).\n In this state of federal legislation, we think that such organizations are suable in the federal courts for their acts, and that funds accumulated to be expended in conducting strikes are subject to execution in suits for torts committed by such unions in strikes. The fact that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has since taken a different view in Baskins v. United Mine Workers of America, supra, cannot under the Conformity Act operate as a limitation on the federal procedure in this regard. \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 392]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion as to the suability of the defendants is confirmed in the case at bar by the words of sections 7 and 8 of the Anti-Trust Law ( Comp. St.  8829, 8830). The persons who may be sued under section 8 include 'corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the territories, the laws of any state, or the laws of any foreign country.' This language is very broad, and the words given their natural signification certainly include labor unions like these. They are, as has been abundantly shown, associations existing under the laws of the United States, of the territories thereof, and of the states of the Union. Congress was passing drastic legislation to remedy a threatening danger to the public welfare, and did not intend that any persons or combinations of persons should escape its application. Their thought was especially directed against business associations and combinations that were unincorporated to do the things forbidden by the act, but they used language broad enough to include all associations which might violate its provisions recognized by the statutes of the United States or the states or the territories, or foreign countries as lawfuly existing; and this, of course, includes labor unions, as the legislation referred to shows. Thus it was that in the cases of United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 U.S. 290\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 540, 41 L. ed. 1007, United States v. Joint Traffic Association, \n171 U.S. 505\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 25, Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 307, and Eastern States Lumber Association v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788, unincorporated associations were made parties to suits in the federal courts under the Anti-Trust Act without question by any one as to the correctness of the procedure.\n For these reasons, we conclude that the International Union, the District No. 21, and the 27 local unions were properly made parties defendant here and properly served by process on their principal officers. \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 393]\n\u00a0\n Third. The next question is whether the International Union was shown by any substantial evidence to have initiated, participated in, or ratified the interference with plaintiffs' business which began April 6, 1914, and continued at intervals until July 17, when the matter culminated in a battle and the destruction of the Bache-Denman properties. The strike was a local strike declared by the president and officers of the District Organization No. 21, embracing Arkansas, kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By section 16 of the International constitution, as we have seen, it could not thus engage in a strike, if it involved all or a major part of its district members, without sanction of the International Board. There is nothing to show that the International Board ever authorized it, took any part in preparation for it or in its maintenance. Nor did they or their organization ratify it by paying any of the expenses. It came exactly within the definition of a local strike in the constitutions of both the national and the district organizations. The district made the preparations and paid the bills. It does appear that the president of the national body was in Kansas City and heard of the trouble which had taken place on April 6 at Prairie Creek, and that at a meeting of the International Board he reported it as something he had learned on his trip for their official information. He said that a man named Bache had demanded in a suit an accounting of the funds of the Southwestern Coal Operators' Association, that when he secured the information he--\n'went down to Arkansas and started to run his mine nonunion. The boys simply marched in on him in a day down there, and kicked his Colorado guards out of there, and broke their jaws, and put the flag of the United Mine Workers on top of the tipple, and pulled the fires out of the boilers, and that was all there was to it, and the mines have been idle ever since. I do not say our boys did this, but I mean the people from all through that country marched in and \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 394]\n\u00a0\n stopped the work, and, when the guards offered resistance, several of them were roughly handled, but no lives were lost, as I understand it.'\n\n Later in May be made a long speech at a special convention of District No. 21 held at Ft. Smith for a purpose not connected with this matter, in which he referred especially to the Colorado and West Virginia strikes, in which the International Union was engaged with all its might, but he made no specific allusion to the Prairie Creek difficulty. It does appear that in 1916, after Stewart, the president of District 21, had been convicted of conspiracy to defeat the injunction issued to protect the Prairie Creek mines in this conflict, and had gone to the penitentiary and was pardoned, White, the national president, wrote a letter thanking the President for this, and that subsequently he appointed Stewart to a position on a district committee. It would be going very far to consider such acts of the president along a ratification by the International Board, creating liability for a past tort. The president had not authority to order or ratify a local strike. Only the board could do this. White's report in an executive meeting of the Board of the riot of April 6 shows sympathy with its purpose and a lack of respect for law, but does not imply or prove on his part any prior initiation or indicate a desire to ratify the transaction as his work. The Board took no action on his report. He did not request it.\n Communications from outsiders and editorials, published in the United Mine Workers journal, giving accounts of the occurrences at Prairie Creek, and representing that the troubles were due to the aggression of the armed guards of the mine owners, and that the action of the union men was justified because in defense of their homes against night attacks, do not constitute such ratification by the Board or the president, after the fact, as to make the International Union liable for what had been done. \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 395]\n\u00a0\n The argument of counsel for the plaintiffs is that, because the national body had authority to discipline district organizations, to make local strikes its own and to pay their cost, if it deemed it wise, the duty was thrust on it, when it knew a local strike was on, to superintend it and prevent its becoming lawless at its peril. We do not conceive that such responsibility is imposed on the national body. A corporation is responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the contention that torts are ultra vires the corporation. But it must be shown that it is in the business of the corporation. Surely no stricter rule can be enforced against an unincorporated organization like this. Here it is not a question of contract, or of holding out an appearance of authority, on which some third person acts. It is a mere question of actual agency, which the constitutions of the two bodies settle conclusively. If the International body had interfered, or if it had assumed liability by ratification, different questions would have arisen.\n Counsel cite section 2 of article 12 of the constitution of District No. 21 to show that questions of all strikes must be referred by district officers to the national president for his decision, and suggest that, in the absence of a showing, it is to be inferred that they did so here, and the strike was approved by him. They misconstrue the section. It applies only to a proposed strike which would affect two districts and to which one district is opposed. It does not apply to local strikes like this.\n But it is said that the district was doing the work of the International and carrying out its policies, and this circumstance makes the former an agent. We cannot agree to this, in the face of the specific stipulation between them that in such a case, unless the International expressly assumed responsibility, the district must meet it alone. The subsequent events, showing that the District did meet \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 396]\n\u00a0\n the responsibility with its own funds, confirm our reliance upon the constitutions of the two bodies.\n We conclude that the motions of the International Union, the United Mine Workers of America, and of its president and its other officers, that the jury be directed to return a verdict for them, should have been granted.\n Fourth. The next question is twofold: (a) Whether the District No. 21 and the individual defendants participated in a plot unlawfully to deprive the plaintiffs of their employees by intimidation and violence and in the course of it destroyed their properties; and (b) whether they did these things in pursuance of a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce.\n The case made for the plaintiff was as follows:\n\n\n (a)\n In March of 1914, when the Prairie Creek No. 4, Mammoth Vein coal mine, and the Coronado mines were operating with union labor, and under a District No. 21 contract and scale of wages and terms which did not expire until July 1 following, Bache, the manager of all the properties, determined to run his mines thereafter on a nonunion or open basis. He had his superintendent prepare a letter setting forth his reasons for the change, and forwarded it to his principals in the East to justify the change of policy which he insisted would result in a substantial reduction in the cost of production. To avoid the charge of a breach of the union scale, he had a contract made between the Mammoth Vein Coal Mining Company, which he controlled, and the Prairie Creek Coal Company and the Mammoth Vein Coal Company, by which the Mammoth Vein Coal Mining Company, a corporation with $100 capital, agreed to run the mines. As it had signed no scale, he considered it free from obligation to the union. He then shut down the mines and prepared to open them on a nonunion basis on April 6. He anticipated trouble. He employed three guards from the Burns Detective Agency, and a number of others to aid them. He bought \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 397]\n\u00a0\n a number of Winchester rifles and ammunition. He surrounded his principal mining plant at Prairie Creek No. 4 with a cable strung on posts. He had notices prepared for his former employees, who occupied the company's houses, to vacate. He had notices warning trespassers from the premises posted at the entrance to the tract that was inclosed within the cable. He sent out for nonunion men, and had gathered some 30 or more at the mine by the day fixed for the opening.\n The mines of the plaintiffs lie in the county of Sebastian, on the west border of Arkansas, next to Oklahoma, in a hilly country. The whole country is full of coal mines. The annual coal-producing capacity of Arkansas is about 2,000,000 tons. The product is a smokeless coal, like the Pocohontas of West Virginia. All the Arkansas mines, but one small one, were union. The towns in the neighborhood, Hartford, Huntington, Midland, Frogtown, and others, were peopled by union miners, and the business done in them was dependent on union miners' patronage. Hartford, a town of 2, 500, was about 3 miles from Prairie Creek; Midland, less in size, lay about the same distance away in another direction; and Huntington was a mile or two further in still another direction. Frogtown was a small village, about a mile and a half from Prairie Creek. Stewart, the president of the District No. 21, and the other officers, promptly declared a local strike against the Prairie Creek and Mammoth Vein mine, and the union miners who had not been discharged from the Coronado mine of the plaintiffs left. Through the agency of the officers of District No. 21 and the local unions, a public meeting was called at the schoolhouse, about a quarter of a mile from the Prairie Creek mine. The influence of the union men was exerted upon the shopkeepers of the towns above named to close their stores and attend the meeting. It was given a picnic character, and women and children attended. The meeting, after listening to \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 398]\n\u00a0\n speeches, appointed a committee to visit the superintendent in charge of the mine. On this committee was one Slankard, a constable of the town of Hartford, and a union man, together with two other union miners. They asked the superintendent that the nonunion men be sent away and the mine resume operations with union men. The committee was attended by a very large body of union miners. They were met at the entrance to the inclosure by two guards with guns carried behind them. The committee was admitted to see the superintendent and the crowd dealt with the guards. The guards had been directed not to use their guns save to defend their own lives or another's. The union miners assaulted the guards, took the guns away, and so injured a number of the employees that four or five had to be sent to a hospital. The crowd swarmed over the premises, forced the pulling of the fires, and hurled stones at the fleeing guards. The result was that all the employees deserted the mine, and it was completely filled with water, which came in when the pumps stopped. One of the crowd went up to the top of the coal tipple and planted a flag on which was the legend, 'This is a union man's country.'\n Mr. Bache, after the riot and lawless violence of April 6, secured from the federal District Court an injunction against those union miners and others whom his agents could identify as having been present and having taken part. This included the president and secretary-treasurer of the District No. 21 and others. Bache then made preparations to resume mining. The mine was full of water and it required a considerable time to pump it out and get things into proper condition. Because of further threats, the court was applied to to send United States deputy marshals to guard the property, and they were sent. Meantime the work of reparation progressed, and Bache's agents were engaged in securing the coming of miners and other employees from in and out of the state \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 399]\n\u00a0\n to enlarge his force. The attitude of the union miners continued hostile, and constant effort was made by them to intercept the groups of men and women who were brought in by Bache from Tennessee and elsewhere, and to turn them away, either by peaceable inducement or by threats and physical intimidation. The vicinage was so permeated with union feeling that the public officers did not hesitate to manifest their enmity toward the nonunion men, and made arrests of the guards and others who were in Bache's employ upon frivolous charges. Rumors were spread abroad through the county that the guards employed by Bache were insulting and making indecent proposals to very young girls in and about Prairie Creek, and P. R. Stewart, the president of District No. 21, in the presence of some 10 persons on the public street of Midland, in the latter part of May, denounced the guards for these insults and proposals, and said that he would furnish the guns if the people would take them. The evidence also disclosed that through the secretary-treasurer of District No. 21, some 40 or more Winchester rifles were bought from the Remington Arms Company and secretly sent to Hartford for the purpose intended by Stewart. They were paid for by a check signed by Hull, the secretary-treasurer of District No. 21, and countersigned by Stewart, the president. Conversations with Stewart, which Stewart did not take the stand to deny, were sworn to, in which he announced that he would not permit the Prairie Creek men to run 'nonunion' and intended to stop it. McLachlin, who was a member of the executive board of District No. 21 in the first week of July gathered up some of the guns, exactly how many does not appear, and shipped them 60 miles to McAlester, Okl., the headquarters of District No. 21. It appeared that guns of like make and caliber were used by the assailants in the attack on the Prairie Creek mine on July 17. The United States marshals had been withdrawn \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 400]\n\u00a0\n from the premises of Prairie Creek mine No. 4, before July 1, though the guards were retained.\n The evidence leaves no doubt that during the month of June there was a plan and movement among the union miners to make an attack upon Prairie Creek mine No. 4. By this time the number of men secured by Bache had increased to 70 or 80, and preparations were rapidly going on for a resumption of mining. The tense feeling in respect to the coming attack increased. On Sunday night, July 12, about midnight, there was a fusillade of shots into the village of Frogtown, a small collection of houses, already mentioned, about a mile and a half from Prairie Creek mine. A number of people, in fright at the cry that 'the scabs were surrounding the town,' left and went to Hartford, about 2 miles away, and thereafted guards were put out at Hartford to defend that town against attack by the guards at Prairie Creek. The ridiculous improbability that the guards at Prairie Creek, who were engaged in protecting themselves and the property and in constant fear of attack, should make this unprovoked assault upon the town of Frogtown, is manifest from the slightest reading of the evidence, and there crept in through a statement of one of the defendants, an active union man, to a witness who testified to it, that this shooting had been done by the Hartford constable, Slankard, and himself, in order to arouse the hostility of the neighborhood against the men at Prairie Creek. On the night of the 16th, the union miners' families who lived in Prairie Creek were warned by friends to leave that vicinity in order to avoid danger, and at 4 o'clock the next morning the attack was begun by a volley of many shots fired into the premises. A large force with guns attacked the mining premises from all sides later on in the day.\n The first movement toward destruction of property was at mine No. 3, a short distance from No. 4, where the coal washhouse was set on fire. The occupants of the premises \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 401]\n\u00a0\n were driven out, except a few who stayed and intrenched themselves behind coal cars or other protection. Most of the employees and their families fled to the ridges, behind which they were able to escape danger from the flying bullets. The forces surrounding the mine were so numerous that by 1 o'clock they had driven out practically all of the defenders, and set fire to the coal tipple of mine No. 4, and destroyed all the plant by the use of dynamite and the match.\n The assailants took some of Batche's employees prisoners as they were escaping, and conducted them to a log cabin behind the schoolhouse near the mine, to which reference has already been made, and where the first riot meeting was held. The four or five prisoners were taken out of the cabin where they had been for a short time confined, and two of them, one a former union man, were deliberately murdered in the presence of their captors, by a man whose indentity it was impossible to establish. The evidence in this case clearly shows that Slankard, the contable of Hartford, was present at the killing, and that the men who were killed were in his custody, on the way, as he said, to the grand jury. He was subsequently tried before a Sebastian county jury for murder, and was acquitted on an alibi. Slankard, though a defendant and in court, did not take the stand in this case. The overwhelming weight of the evidence establishes that this was purely a union attack, under the guidance of district officers.\n The testimony offered by defendants to show that it was only an uprising of the indignant citizens of the countryside really tended to confirm the guilt of the District No. 21. Its palpably artificial character showed that basis for it had been framed in advance for the purpose of relieving the officers of District No. 21 and the union miners of that neighborhood from responsibility for the contemplated execution of their destructive and criminal purpose. It is a doubtful question whether this responsibility \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 402]\n\u00a0\n was not so clearly established that, had that been the only element needed to justify a verdict, the court properly might have directed it. The president of District No. 21 and the union miners, including Slankard, whose agency in and leadership of this attack were fully proven, were present in the courtroom at the trial, but did not take the stand to deny the facts established. Indeed, they had been previously brought to trial for conspiracy to defeat the federal administration of justice and for contempt because of these very acts, had pleaded guilty to the charge made, and had been sentenced to imprisonment, and their expenses as defendants in and out of jail had been paid by the district out of the district treasury and the disbursements approved by the district in convention.\n It is contended on behalf of District No. 21 and the local unions that only those members of these bodies whom the evidence shows to have participated in the torts can be held civilly liable for the damages. There was evidence to connect all these individual defendants with the acts which were done, and, in view of our finding that District No. 21 and the unions are suable, we cannot yield to the argument that it would be necessary to show the guilt of every member of District No. 21 and of each union in order to hold the union and its strike funds to answer. District No. 21 and the local unions were engaged in a work in which the strike was one of the chief instrumentalities for accomplishing the purpose for which their unions were organized. By section 1 of arricle 12 of the constitution of District No. 21, it is provided that:\n'When trouble of a legal character arises between the members of local unions and their employer, the mine committee and officers shall endeavor to effect an amicable adjustment, and failing they shall immediately notify the officers of the district and said district officers shall immediately investigate the cause of the complaint, \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 403]\n\u00a0\n and failing to effect a peaceful settlement upon a basis that would be equitable and just to the aggrieved members, finding that a strike would best subserve the interests of the localities affected, they may, with the consent and approval of the officers, order a strike.'\n\n Thus the authority is put by all the members of the District No. 21 in their officers to order a strike, and if in the conduct of that strike unlawful injuries are inflicted, the district organization is responsible, and the fund accumulated for strike purposes may be subjected to the payment of any judgment which is recovered.\n\n\n (b)\n It was necessary, however, in order to hold District No. 21 liable in this suit under the Anti-Trust Act, to establish that this conspiracy to attack the Bache-Denman mines and stop the nonunion employment there was with intent to restrain interstate commerce and to monopolize the same, and to subject it to the control of the union. The evidence upon which the plaintiffs relied to establish this, and upon which the judgment of the trial court and of the Court of Appeals went, consisted of a history of the relations between the International Union and the union coal operators of certain so-called competitive districts from 1898 until 1914. The miners of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, large bituminous coal-producing states, were members of the union, and the coal operators of those states, in spite of strikes and lockouts from time to time, were properly classed as union operators. They met yearly in conference with the union's representatives to agree upon terms of employment from April 1st to April 1st. In these conferences the operators frequently complained that the competition of many nonunion mines in Western Pennsylvania and the whole of West Virginia was ruinous to their business because of the low cost of production of coal in such mines, due to the lower wages and less expensive conditions of working than \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 404]\n\u00a0\n in union mines, and urged that something must be done to stop this, or that the union scale of wages be reduced. By section 8 of the contract between the operators of the Central Competitive Coal Field and the United Mine Workers of America, dated Chicago, January 28, 1898, it was stipulated:\n'That the United Mine Workers organization, a party to this contract, do hereby further agree to afford all possible protection to the trade and to other parties hereto against any unfair competition resulting from a failure to maintain scale rates.'\n\n From this time on in every annual conference until after the controversy in the case before us in 1914 the subject recurred. It does not appear when, if at any time, wages were reduced because of this plea by the operators. Sometimes the contention of the operators as to the effect of nonunion competition was conceded, and greater activity in unionizing nonunion territory was promised. Again pleas were made by the miners' representatives of the great amount of money expended by the union, and in one or two instances of the sacrifice of human lives, to effect this result. Again the union leaders flatly refused to be further affected by the argument, and charged that the nonunion competition of West Virginia, which was always the principal factor, was only possible because some of the most important union operators in Ohio and the Central Competitive Field really were interested as nonunion operators in West Virginia. There was considerable discussion as to the nonunion competition of Kentucky fields as a basis for the operators' complaints. At times there were suggestions from the miners' side that the operators ought to contribute funds to enable the campaign of unionizing to go on, but they never seem to have met with favor.\n In general convention of the union of 1904, a local union from the Indian Territory in District No. 21 submitted a resolution which was adopted in respect to the then Colorado strike: \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 405]\n\u00a0\n 'Resolved, that in strict compliance with our obligations and teachings, we accord a hearty approval to our National Board on its action in regard to District No. 15 now on in Colorado, and whatever action taken by the National that in their judgment is necessary to the successful ending in the elevating of the craft in District No. 15, meets our entire approval, for which we pledge out unqualified support, as our knowledge of the southern field of Southern Colorado in the event of an unsuccessful issue of the trouble now pending would work almost unsurmountable and incalculable damage to District No. 21, as it would be an unjust competition in the same commercial field and could with little effort undersell and supersede us in Oklahoma and Southwestern Kansas markets.'\n In a joint conference between the union leaders and the coal operators, in 1904, Mr. Mitchell, the president of the union, spoke as follows:\n'I believe the discussion of this matter should be carried on with perfect frankness and candor on both sides. I don't think we should disguise our position at all, and I want to state for our side of the house just where we are, as I understand it. We don't believe that a reduction in the mining rate will help you. We know that it will do us incalculable injury. We don't believe that a reduction in the mining rate will secure for you a larger amount of trade than you now have. We don't believe that the industry will be benefited by reducing wages. We know that in the past every reduction in wages has been given to the large consumers of coal-not to the domestic trade, not to those who can ill afford to pay high rates for coal, but to the railroad companies and the great manufacturers. We know that when the mining rate is lowest your profits have been least.\n\n'Now, gentlemen, it has required many years of work and effort and sacrifice to make wages at the \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 406]\n\u00a0\n mines compare favorably with wages in other industries. We are not going back to the old conditions; we are not going to consent to a reduction in wages. We believe the best thing to do is to renew out present wage scale; to make such modifications of internal questions as seem right, and then return and work out the coming scale year as we have the past scale year. I think we may as well understand now as at any other time that we are not going to consent to a reduced mining rate.'\n\n At the convention in 1906, a resolution that Districts 13, 14, 21, 24, and 25 be admitted to the interstate joint conferences was adopted. This was urged by President Mitchell of the Union, and the secretary, W. B. Wilson. The latter said:\n'If I understand the principle upon which this movement is based, it is to bring into the joint conference those operators and those miners of the Southwestern District whose competitive business is closely related to each other, and in asking that the operators of the Southwestern District be admitted to this conference, we are simply carrying out that principle. The coal mined in Western Pennsylvania comes in immediate competition and direct competition with Ohio; that mined in Ohio, as well as that in Pennsylvania, comes in competition with Indiana and Illinois; that mined in Illinois comes in contact with Kowa; that mined in Iowa comes in competition with Missouri and coal mined in Missouri comes in competition with Kansas, Arkansas, and the Indian Territory. They are all related to one another. They are all competitors with one another, and it is but just and fair that each of these fields should have a representation in the joint conference that sets a base for the prices of the ensuing year. This is the first conference that is held. Whatever wages are agreed upon here, whether it is an increase in wages, a decrease in wages, improved conditions or otherwise, it sets the pace for other districts and those \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 407]\n\u00a0\n other districts have no voice in saying what that price shall be. In order to avoid that condition of affairs, in order to give justice to the operators and miners in other fields not represented here at the present time, we ask you as a matter of fairness and justice to permit those whose operators and miners are represented here, to participate in this joint conference.'\n\n In 1910, Bache, as a union operator, took part for his mines in fixing the scale of wages in District No. 21. Later on, at the time of a conference, he made a separate scale with the District No. 21 more favorable in some respects than that subsequently agreed on in the conference with the other operators, and he was for that reason expelled from the operators' association. He was permitted at a later time to rejoin it, but he had some litigation with it in respect to their funds, the nature of which is not disclosed by the record.\n In 1913 and 1914, and in the years preceding, the International Union had carried on two strikes of great extent covering the Colorado fields, and the Ohio and West Virginia fields, in which very large sums of money had been expended and there was much lawlessness and violence. Its treasury had been drained and it borrowed $75,000 from District No. 21 during this period.\n The foregoing will enable one to acquire a fair idea of the national situation, shown by the record, in respect to the mining and sale of coal, so far as it bears upon this case and upon this state of fact. The plaintiffs charge that there has been and is a continuously operating conspiracy between union coal operators and the International Union to restrain interstate commerce in coal and to monopolize it, and that the work of District No. 21 at Prairie Creek was a step in that conspiracy for which it can be held liable under the Anti-Trust Act.\n Coal mining is not interstate commerce, and the power of Congress does not extend to its regulation as such. In \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 408]\n\u00a0\n Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251, 272\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 529, 531 (62 L. Ed. 1101, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724) we said:\n'The making of goods and the mining of coal are not commerce, not does the fact that these things are to be afterwards shipped or used in interstate commerce make their production a part thereof. Delaward, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 U.S. 439\n.'\n\n Obstruction to coal mining is not a direct obstruction to interstate commerce in coal, although it, of course, may affect it by reducing the amount of coal to be carried in that commerce. We have had occasion to consider the principles governing the validity of congressional restraint of such indirect obstructions to interstate commerce in Swift v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276; United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325; United States v. Ferger, \n250 U.S. 199\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 445; Wisconsin R. R. Commission v. C., B. & Q. R. R. (decided February 27, 1922) \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, and Stafford v. Wallace (decided May 1, 1922) \n258 U.S. 495\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 397, 66 L. Ed. --. It is clear from these cases that if Congress deems certain recurring practices though not really part of interstate commerce, likely to obstruct, restrain or burden it, it has the power to subject them to national supervision and restraint. Again, it has the power to punish conspiracies, in which such practices are part of the plan to hinder, restrain, or monopolize interstate commerce. But in the latter case the intent to injure, obstruct, or restrain interstate commerce must appear as an obvious consequence of what is to be done, or be shown by direct evidence or other circumstance.\n What really is shown by the evidence in the case at bar, drawn from discussions and resolutions of conventions and conference, is the stimulation of union leaders to press their unionization of nonunion mines, not only as a direct means of bettering the conditions and wages of their workers, but also as a means of lessening interstate competition for union operators, which in turn would lessen the pressure of those operators for reduction of the union scale or their resistance to an increase. The latter is a \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 409]\n\u00a0\n secondary or ancillary motive, whose actuating force in a given case necessarily is dependent on the particular circumstances to which it is sought to make is applicable. If unlawful means had here been used by the national body to unionize mines whose product was important, actually or potentially, in affecting prices in interstate commerce, the evidence in question would clearly tend to show that that body was guilty of an actionable conspiracy under the Anti-Trust Act. This principle is involved in the decision of the case of Hitchman Coal Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 U.S. 229\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461, and is restated in American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 U.S. 184\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 72, decided December 5, 1921. But it is not a permissible interpretation of the evidence in question that it tends to show that the motive indicated thereby actuates every lawless strike of a local and sporadic character, not initiated by the national body, but by one of its subordinate subdivisions. The very fact that local strikes are provided for in the union's constitution, and so may not engage the energies or funds of the national body, confirms this view. Such a local case of a lawless strike must stand on its own facts, and, while these conventions and discussions may reveal a general policy, the circumstances or direct evidence should supply the link between them and the local situation to make an unlawful local strike, not initiated or financed by the main organization, a step in an actionable conspiracy to restrain the freedom of interstate commerce which the Anti-Trust Act was intended to protect.\n This case is very different from Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815. There the gist of the charge held to be a violation of the Anti-Trust Act was the effort of the defendants, members of a trades union, by a boycott against a manufacturer of hats, to destroy his interstate sales in hats. The direct object of attack was interstate commerce.\n So, too, it differs from Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788, where \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 410]\n\u00a0\n the interstate retail trade of wholesale lumber men with consumers was restrained by a combination of retail dealers by an agreement among the latter to blacklist or boycott any wholesaler engaged in such retail trade. It was the commerce itself which was the object of the conspiracy. In United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325, running a corner in cotton in New York City, by which the defendants were conspiring to obtain control of the available supply and to enhance the price to all buyers in every market of the country, was held to be a conspiracy to restrain interstate trade, because cotton was the subject of interstate trade, and such control would directly and materially impede and burden the due course of trade among the states, and inflict upon the public the injuries which the Anti-Trust Act was designed to prevent. Although running the corner was not interstate commerce, the necessary effect of the control of the available supply would be to obstruct and restrain interstate commerce, and so the conspirators were charged with the intent to restrain. The difference between the Patten Case and that of Ware & Leland Co. v. Mobile County, \n209 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 526, 14 Ann. Cas. 1031, illustrates a distinction to be drawn in cases which do not involve interstate commerce intrinsically but which may or may not be regarded as affecting interstate commerce so directly as to be within the federal regulatory power. In the Ware & Leland Case, the question was whether a state could tax the business of a broker dealing in contracts for the future delivery of cotton where there was no obligation to ship from one state to another. The tax was sustained, and dealing in cotton futures was held not to be interstate commerce, and yet thereafter such dealings in cotton futures as were alleged in the Patten Case, where they were part of a conspiracy to bring the entire cotton trade within its influence, were held to be in restraint of interstate commerce. And so in the case at bar coal mining is not interstate commerce, and obstruction \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 411]\n\u00a0\n of coal mining, though it may prevent coal from going into interstate commerce, is not a restraint of that commerce, unless the obstruction to mining is intended to restrain commerce in it, or has necessarily such a direct, material, and substantial effect to restrain it that the intent reasonably must be inferred.\n In the case at bar there is nothing in the circumstances or the declarations of the parties to indicate that Stewart, the president of District No. 21, or Hull, its secretary-treasurer, or any of their accomplices, had in mind interference with interstate commerce or competition when they entered upon their unlawful combination to break up Bache's plan to carry on his mines with nonunion men. The circumstances were ample to supply a full local motive for the conspiracy. Stewart said: 'We are not going to let them dig coal-the scabs.' His attention and that of his men was fastened on the presence of nonunion men in the mines in that local community. The circumstance that a car loaded with coal and billed to a town in Louisiana was burned by the conspirators has no significance upon this head. The car had been used in the battle by some of Bache's men for defense. It offered protection, and its burning was only a part of the general destruction.\n Bache's breach of his contract with the District No. 21, in employing nonunion men three months before it expired, his attempt to evade his obligation by a hugger-mugger of his numerous corporations, his advertised anticipation of trespass and violence by warning notices, by inclosing his mining premises with a cable and stationing guards with guns to defend them, all these, in the heart of a territory that had been completely unionized for years, were calculated to arouse a bitterness of spirit entirely local among the union miners against a policy that brought in strangers, and excluded themselves or their union colleagues from the houses they had occupied and \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 412]\n\u00a0\n the wages they had enjoyed. In the letter which Bache dictated, in favor of operating the mines on a nonunion basis, he said:\n'To do this means a bitter fight, but in my opinion it can be accomplished by proper organization.'\n\n Bache also testified that he was entering into a matter he knew was perilous and dangerous to his companies, because in that section there was only one other mine running on a nonunion basis. Nothing of this is recited to justify in the slightest the lawlessness and outrages committed, but only to point out that as it was a local strike within the meaning of the International and district constitutions, so it was in fact a local strike, local in its origin and motive, local in its waging, and local in its felonious and murderous ending.\n But it is said that these district officers and their lieutenants among the miners must be charged with an intention to do what would be the natural result of their own acts, that they must have known that obstruction to mining coal in the Bache-Denman mines would keep 75 per cent. of their output from being shipped out of the state into interstate competition, and to that extent would help union operators in their competition for business. In a national production of from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000 tons a week, or in a production in District No. 21 of 150,000 tons a week, 5,000 tons a week, which the Bache-Denman mines in most prosperous times could not exceed, would have no appreciable effect upon the price of coal or nonunion competition. The saving in the price per ton of coal under nonunion conditions was said by plaintiff's witnesses to be from 17 to 20 cents; but surely no one would say that such saving on 5,000 tons would have a substantial effect on prices of coal in interstate commerce. Nor could it be inferred that Bache intended to cut the price of coal. His purpose was probably to pocket the profit that such a reduction made possible. If it be said that what District No. 21 feared \n\n[259 U.S. 344, 413]\n\u00a0\n was that, if Bache were successful, the defection among union operators would spread, and ultimately the whole district field of District No. 21 in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas would become nonunion, and interstate commerce would then be substantially affected, it may be answered that this is remote, and no statement or circumstance appears in the record from which it can be inferred that the participants in the local strike had such a possibility in mind, or thought they were thus protecting union operators in a control or monopoly of interstate commerce. The result of our consideration of the entire record is that there was no evidence submitted to the jury upon which they properly could find that the outrages, felonies, and murders of District 21 and its companions in crime were committed by them in a conspiracy to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce. The motion to direct the jury to return a verdict for the defendants should have been granted.\n Fifth. These conclusions make it unnecessary to examine the objection which the plaintiffs in error make to the supplemental charge of the court.\n The case has been prepared by counsel for the plaintiffs with rate assiduity and ability. The circumstances are such as to awaken regret that, in our view of the federal jurisdiction, we cannot affirm the judgment. But it is of far higher importance that we should preserve inviolate the fundamental limitations in respect to the federal jurisdiction.\n The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 1.

S.(1922)\nNo. 119\nArgued: Decided: April 17, 1922\n\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles F. Choate, Jr., and Frederick P. Fish, both of Boston, Mass., and Cordenio A. Severance, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellants. \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. La Rue Brown and Elias Field, both of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States against the defendants, United Shoe Machinery Company (of Maine), United Shoe Machinery Corporation, United Shoe Machinery Company (of New Jersey), and the officers and directors of these corporations, under the provisions of Clayton Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 731, 736, to enjoin them from making leases containing certain clauses, terms and conditions alleged to be violative of the act. Issues were made up, testimony taken, and a decree granted by the District Court enjoining the use of certain clauses in the leases. 264 Fed. 138. From that decree the present appeal was prosecuted to this court.\n The record embraces 27 volumes of printed matter and 4 volumes of exhibits. The summary of testimony compiled by the defendants contains more than 1,000 pages. Much of it has but little bearing on the real issues to be decided, and so much as was essential might well have been embraced within a much narrower compass than is contained in the voluminous record now before us.\n Section 3 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  8835c), so far as pertinent, makes it unlawful for persons engaged in interstate commerce in the course of such commerce to lease machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption, or resale within the United States, or to fix a price therefor, or to discount from, or rebate upon, such price, upon the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee thereof shall not use or deal in the machinery, supplies, or other commodities of the competitor or competitors of the lessor, where the effect \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n of such lease, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n The trial judge states that he took the time necessary to read and examine this voluminous record, and from it in the course of his opinion he makes certain findings of fact. These findings are entitled to the presumption of correctness which is given to the conclusions of a chancellor reached upon consideration of conflicting evidence, and we may add that in this case the opinion gives evidence of careful and painstaking research.\n Our own examination of the testimony gives little occasion to modify the findings of fact made by the District Court. The record discloses that the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, hereinafter called the United Company, controlled a very large portion of the business of supplying shoe machinery of the classes involved in this case. The court below found that it controlled more than 95 per cent. of such business in the United States. Whether this finding is precisely correct it is immaterial to inquire. It is evident from this record that the United Company occupies a dominant position in the production of such machinery and makes and supplies throughout the United States a very large percentage of such machinery used by manufacturers.\n It may be conceded at the outset, and was so found in the court below, that the company did not act oppressively in the enforcement of the forfeiture clauses of the leases. It is established that it furnishes machines of excellent quality; that it renders valuable services in the installation of machines, instructions to operators, promptness in furnishing machines when desired by manufacturers, and is expeditious in making repairs and replacements when necessary so to do. The machines of the United Company are protected by patents granted prior to the passage of the Clayton Act, and the validity of none of them is called in question here. \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n It is contended that the suit must fail for want of necessary parties, inasmuch as the lessees were not brought into it; that they were necessary parties because their rights were necessarily adjudicated in enjoining the enforcements of the contracts involved. But we agree with the District Court that the lessees were not indispensable or even necessary parties. The relation of indispensable parties to the suit must be such that no decree can be entered in the case which will do justice to the parties before the court without injuriously affecting the rights of absent parties. 1 Street's Equity Practice, 519, quoted with approval in Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank Co., \n215 U.S. 33\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 10, in which case the former adjudications in this court are cited and considered. The covenants enjoined were inserted for the benefit of the lessor, and were of such restrictive character that no right of the lessee could be injuriously affected by the injunction which was prayed in the case. We are of opinion that their presence was not necessary to a decision.\n Turning to the decree, it will be found that the court enjoined the use of (1) the restricted use clause, which provides that the leased machinery shall not, nor shall any part thereof, be used upon shoes, etc., or portions thereof, upon which certain other operations have not been performed on other machines of the defendants; (2) the exclusive use clause, which provides that if the lessee fails to use exclusively machinery of certain kinds made by the lessor, the lessor shall have the right to cancel the right to use all such machinery so leased; (3) the supplies clause, which provides that the lessee shall purchase supplies exclusively from the lessor; (4) the patent insole clause, which provides that the lessee shall only use machinery leased on shoes which have had certain other operations performed upon them by the defendants' machines; ( 5) the additional machinery clause, which provides that the lessee shall take all additional machinery for \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n certain kinds of work from the lessor or lose his right to retain the machines which he has already leased; (6) the factory output clause, which requires the payment of a royalty on shoes operated upon by machines made by competitors; (7) the discriminatory royalty clause providing lower royalty for lessees who agree not to use certain machinery on shoes lasted on machines other than those leased from the lessor. The defendant's restrictive form of leases embraces the right of the lessor to cancel a lease for the breach of a provision in such lease, or in any other lease or license agreement between the lessor and the lessee. The lessor in such case is given the right, by notice in writing to the lessee, to terminate any and all leases or licenses then in force to use the machinery and this notwithstanding previous breaches or defaults may have been unnoticed, waived, or condoned by or on behalf of the lessor. The District Court held that the United Company had the right to cancel a lease for a violation of the terms of the particular lease, but could not, without violating the act reserve the right to cancel a lease because the lessee had violated the terms of some other lease. This part of the decree must be read in the light of the circumstances shown as to the necessity of procuring shoe machinery from the United Company, and the danger of a lessee losing his ability to continue business by a forfeiture incurred from the breach of a single covenant in one lease.\n While the clauses enjoined do not contain specific agreements not to use the machinery of a competitor of the lessor, the practical effect of these drastic provisions is to prevent such use. We can entertain no doubt that such provisions as were enjoined are embraced in the broad terms of the Clayton Act, which cover all conditions, agreements, or understandings of this nature. That such restrictive and tying agreements must necessarily lessen competition and tend to monopoly is, we believe, equally apparent. When it is considered that the United Company \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n occupies a dominating position in supplying shoe machinery of the classes involved, these covenants, signed by the lessee and binding upon him, effectually prevent him from acquiring the machinery of a competitor of the lessor, except at the risk of forfeiting the right to use the machines furnished by the United Company, which may be absolutely essential to the prosecution and success of his business.\n This system of 'tying' restrictions is quite as effective as express covenants could be, and practically compels the use of the machinery of the lessor, except upon risks which manufacturers will not willingly incur. It is true that the record discloses that in many instances these provisions were not enforced. In some cases they were. In frequent instances it was sufficient to call the attention of the lessee to the fact that they were contained in the lease to insure a compliance with their provisions. The power to enforce them is omnipresent, and their restraining influence constantly operates upon competitors and lessees. The fact that the lessor in many instances forbore to enforce these provisions does not make them any less agreements within the condemnation of the Clayton Act.\n It is contended that the decree in favor of the defendants affirmed in the former suit of the government under the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), \n247 U.S. 32\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 473, between the same parties is res judicata of the issues in the present case.\n Perhaps the leading case in this court upon the subject of estoppel by former judgment is Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 U.S. 351\n, 352 (24 L. Ed. 195), in which this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, laid down the general rule of law, which has been followed in subsequent cases:\n'... There is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar or estoppel against the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the same parties upon a different claim or cause of action. In the \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n former case, the judgment, if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action, ... concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. ... But where the second action between the same parties is upon a different claim or demand, the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. In all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a judgment rendered upon one cause of action to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action, not what might have been thus litigated and determined.'\n\n In other words, to determine the effect of a former judgment pleaded as an estoppel, two questions must be answered: (1) Was the former judgment rendered on the same cause of action? (2) If not, was some matter litigated in the former suit determinative of a matter in controversy in the second suit? To answer these questions, we must look to the pleadings making the issues, and examine the record to determine the questions essential to the decision of the former controversy.\n The Sherman Act suit had for its object the dissolution of the United Company, which had been formed by the union of other shoe machinery companies. It also attacked and sought to enjoin the use of the restrictive and tying clauses contained in the leases as being in themselves contracts in violation of the Sherman Act. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act provide different tests of liability. This was determined in the recent case of Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane Houston Co. (decided April 10, 1922) 258 U. S. \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 460]\n\u00a0\n 346, 42 Sup. Ct. 360, 66 L. Ed. --. In that case we pointed out that the Clayton Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act, and within its limited sphere established its own rule. Under the Sherman Act, as interpreted by this court before the passage of the Clayton Act, contracts were prohibited which unduly restrained the natural flow of interstate commerce, or which materially interrupt the free exercise of competition in the channels of interstate trade. In the second section monopolization or attempts to monopolize interstate trade were condemned. The Clayton Act ( section 3) prohibits contracts of sale, or leases made upon the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser or lessee shall not deal in or use the goods of a competitor of the seller or lessor where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract, or such condition, agreement, or understanding 'may' be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create monopoly. The cause of action is therefore not the same.\n That the leases were attacked under the former bill as violative of the Sherman Act is true, but they were sustained as valid and binding agreements within the rights of holders of patents. The Clayton Act specifically applies to goods, wares, machinery, etc., whether 'patented or unpatented.' This provision was inserted in the Clayton Act with the express purpose of preventing rights granted by letters patent from securing immunity from the inhibitions of the act. The determination of the questions now raised under the Clayton Act was not essential to the former decision. The defendants in their argument seize upon isolated passages in the opinion of the court in the former case, and contend that they are decisive here. But the effect of the former judgment as an estoppel is not to be thus determined. Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259, 269\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 95, and cases therein cited. In the Sherman Act case the issues were clearly stated in the prevailing opinion of this court:\n'The \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 461]\n\u00a0\n charge of the bill is that the defendants, not being satisfied with the monopoly of their patents and determined to extend it, conceived the idea of acquiring the ownership or control of all concerns engaged in the manufacture of all kinds of shoe machinery. This purpose was achieved, it is charged, and a monopoly acquired, and commerce, interstate and foreign, restrained by the union of competing companies and the acquisition of others. And that leases were exacted which completed and assured the control and monopoly thus acquired. ...\n\n'There are two accusations against the defendants. One is that at the very outset they combined competing companies and subsequently acquired others, section 1 of the act of 1890 being thereby offended. The other is a monopolization of the trade in violation of section 2 of that act. And it is charged, as we have said, that certain leases and license agreements are the instruments which consummate both offenses.'\n\n After disposing of the charge adversely to the government's contention that the union of the pre-existing companies, constituting the United Company, was a combination in restraint of trade, the court passed to a consideration of the leases and said:\n'There was complaint of them and the government attacks them. ... To the attacks of the government the defendants reply that the leases are the exercise of their right as patentees and if there is monopoly in them, it is the monopoly of the right. ... We must not overestimate the right or give it a sinister effect-permit it to be the means, to use the words of the government, 'to the building up and entrenchment' of an 'illegal monopoly.' ...\n\n'Of course, there is restraint in a patent. Its strength is in the restraint, the right to exclude others from the use of the invention, absolutely or on the terms which the patentee chooses to impose. This strength is the compensation \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 462]\n\u00a0\n which the law grants for the exercise of invention. Its exercise within the field covered by the patent law is not an offense against the Anti-Trust Act. In other circumstances it may be, as in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 U.S. 20\n, to which case that at bar has no resemblance.\n\n'The question, then, is: Was the patent right lawfully exerted in the leases? Were they anything more than the exercise of the patent monopoly?'\n\n This question the court proceeded to answer in the negative.\n The issue whether the restrictive clauses were valid in view of the provision of the Clayton Act concerning machinery patented or unpatented was not and could not have been involved or decided in the former suit. It is true that the court speaks of the excellence and efficiency of the United Company's machinery as a sufficient inducement for its installation by the lessees, and we may add that there is much testimony in the record tending to show that it was the excellence of the United Company's machinery and the efficiency of its service which induced lessees to acquire its machinery; but these considerations are apart from the pertinent issues which here confront us. No matter how good the machines of the United Company may be, or how efficient its service, it is not at liberty to lease its machines upon conditions prohibited by a valid law of the United States. Congress has undertaken to deny the protection of patent rights to such covenants as come within the terms of the Clayton Act, and if the statute is constitutional, the sole duty of the court is to enforce it in accordance with its terms.\n It is contended that the act is an unconstitutional limitation upon the rights secured to a patentee under the laws of the United States, and that it takes away from patentees without due process of law property secured to them by the grant of the patent. The solution of this \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 463]\n\u00a0\n contention depends upon the nature and extent of the rights secured under the grant of a patent.\n From an early day it has been held by this court that the franchise secured by a patent consists only in the right to exclude others from making, using, or vending the thing patented without the permission of the patentee. Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539. This definition of the rights of the patentee has been the subject of frequent recent decisions of this court, and has been approved and applied in Bauer v. O'Donnell, \n229 U.S. 1\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S .) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 U.S. 490\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, ann. Cas. 1918A, 955; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 U.S. 502\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 U.S. 8\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 257, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 447. The subject was given full consideration in Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra, in which the former decision of this court, Henry v. Dick, \n224 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, holding that a mimeograph made under letters patent might be sold with a license agreement limiting its use to certain unpatented articles, was specifically overruled, and it was held that the patentee received from the law no more than the exclusive right to make, use and sell the invention. Undoubtedly the patentee has the right to grant the use of the rights or privileges conferred by his patent to others by making licenses and agreements with them which are not in themselves unlawful, but the right to make regulation in the public interest under the police power of the states or in the exertion of the authority of Congress over matters within its constitutional power is controlled by general principles of law, and the patent right confers no privilege to make contracts in themselves illegal, and certainly not to make those directly violative of valid statutes of the United States. It was held by this court in Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 U.S. 20\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 9, that the rights secured by a patent do not protect \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 464]\n\u00a0\n the making of contracts in restraint of trade, or those which tend to monopolize trade or commerce in violation of the Sherman Act. That principle was followed with approval when applied to rights secured under the copyright laws of the United States. Straus v. Publishers' Association, \n231 U.S. 222\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 84, L. R. A. 1915A, 1099, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 369. The same conclusion was reached in a well considered opinion in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts involving a state enactment. Opinions of the Justices, 193 Mass. 605, 81 N. E. 142. The same principle applies to the Clayton Act. The patent grant does not limit the right of Congress to enact legislation not interfering with the legitimate rights secured by the patent, but prohibiting in the public interest the making of agreements which may lessen competition and build up monopoly.\n It is further insisted that the suit must fail because the parties were offered an alternative lease alleged to be free from the objectionable conditions complained of. But this lease was only granted upon the lessee making an initial payment in cash instead of paying the lessor royalties throughout the term. There is some conflict in the testimony as to whether the effect of such requirement was so onerous as to compel the lessee to choose the restricted form of leases. The issue involved here is whether leases with the restricted clauses in them, the enforcement of which has been enjoined by the District Court, were such as to make them violative of the provisions of the Clayton Act. The fact that a form of lease was offered which is not the subject of controversy is not a justification of the use of clauses in other leases which we find to be violative of the act.\n The defendants contend that the form of lease which they have adopted since the Clayton Act became effective is free from the restrictive and tying clauses, and is, therefore, unobjectionable, and hence no injunction should issue. These leases are terminable upon 30 \n\n[258 U.S. 451, 465]\n\u00a0\n days notice, and are denominated temporary loan agreements. They were evidently framed in view of the Clayton Act, and litigation likely to arise over the former leases in view of that enactment. The court below so found, and expressed the opinion that should the defendants' contention be sustained, and the conditions in controversy be held legitimate, leases containing them would again be insisted upon. The earnestness and zeal with which the right to use these clauses has been insisted upon throughout, confirms the conclusion of the trial judge. The fate of these substituted forms of leases evidently depends upon the outcome of this suit.\n It is insisted that the leases in controversy were not made in the course of interstate commerce, and, therefore, cannot be embraced within the terms of the Clayton Act. It is provided in the decree that it shall apply to all leases covering shoe machinery shipped from one state to the user or factory for use in another state in the course of or as a part of the transaction between the lessor and the lessee, resulting in the making of the lease. It is true that the mere making of the lease of the machines is not of itself interstate commerce. But where, connected with the making of such lease, a movement of goods in interstate commerce is required, we have no doubt of the authority and purpose of Congress to control the making of such leases by the enactment of the statute before us.\n Other matters are urged, but we have noticed those deemed necessary to a decision of the case. We find no error in the decree of the court below, and the same is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED ZINC & CHEMICAL CO. v.

The facts that for the purposes of decision we shall assume to have been proved are these. The petitioner owned a tract of about twenty acres in the outskirts of the town of Iola, Kansas. Formerly it had there a plant for the making of sulphuric acid and zinc spelter. In 1910 it tore the buildings down but left a basement and cellar, in which in July, 1916, water was accumulated, clear in appearance but in fact dangerously poisoned by sulphuric acid and zinc sulphate that had come in one way or another from the petitioner's works, as the petitioner knew. The respondents had been travelling and encamped at some distance from this place. A travelled way passed within 120 or 100 feet of it. On July 27, 1916, the children, who were eight and eleven years old, came upon the petitioner's land, went into the water, were poisoned and died. The petitioner saved the question whether it could be held liable. At the trial the Judge instructed the jury that if the water looked clear but in fact was poisonous and thus the children were allured to it the petitioner was liable. The respondents got a verdict and judgment, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 264 Fed. 785.\n Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. McDonald, \n152 U.S. 262\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 619, and kindred cases were relied upon as leading to the result, and perhaps there is language in that and in Sioux City & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, that might seem to justify it; but the doctrine needs very careful statement not to make an unjust and impracticable requirement. If the children had been adults they would have had no case. \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n They would have been trespassers and the owner of the land would have owed no duty to remove even hidden danger; it would have been entitled to assume that they would obey the law and not trespass. The liability for spring guns and mantraps arises from the fact that the defendant has not rested on that assumption, but on the contrary has expected the trespasser and prepared and injury that is no more justified than if he had held the gun and fired it. Chenery v. Fitchburg R. R. Co., 160 Mass, 211, 213, 35 N. E. 554, 22 L. R. A. 575. Infants have no greater right to go upon other people's land than adults, and the mere fact that they are infants imposes no duty upon landowners to expect them and to prepare for their safety. On the other hand the duty of one who invites another upon his land not to lead him into a trap is well settled, and while it is very plain that temptation is not invitation, it may be held that knowingly to establish and expose, unfenced, to children of an age when they follow a bait as mechanically as a fish, something that is certain to attract them, has the legal effect of an invitation to them although not to an adult. But the principle if accepted must be very cautiously applied.\n In Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, the well-known case of a boy injured on a turntable, it appeared that children had played there before to the knowledge of employees of the railroad, and in view of that fact and the situation of the turntable near a road without visible separation, it seems to have been assumed without much discussion that the railroad owed a duty to the boy. Perhaps this was as strong a case as would be likely to occur of maintaining a known temptation, where temptation takes the place of invitation. A license was implied and liability for a danger not manifest to a child was declared in the very similar case of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Ry. of Ireland \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 1909]\n\u00a0\n, A. C. 229.\n In the case at bar it is at least doubtful whether the water could be seen from any place where the children lawfully \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n were and there is no evidence that it was what led them to enter the land. But that is necessary to start the supposed duty. There can be no general duty on the part of a land-owner to keep his land safe for children, or even free from hidden dangers, if he has not directly or by implication invited or licensed them to come there. The difficulties in the way of implying a license are adverted to in Chenery v. Fitchburg R. R. Co., 160 Mass. 211, 212, 35 N. E. 554, 22 L. R. A. 575, but need not be considered here. It does not appear that children were in the habit of going to the place; so that foundation also fails.\n Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. McDonald, \n152 U.S. 262\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 619, is less in point. There a boy was burned by falling into burning coal slack close by the side of a path on which he was running homeward from other boys who had frightened him. It hardly appears that he was a trespasser and the path suggests an invitation; at all events boys habitually resorted to the place where he was. Also the defendant was under a statutory duty to fence the place sufficiently to keep out cattle. The decision is very far from establishing that the petitioner is liable for poisoned water not bordering a road, not shown to have been the inducement that led the children to trespass, if in any event the law would deem it sufficient to excuse their going there, and not shown to have been the indirect inducement because known to the children to be frequented by others. It is suggested that the roads across the place were invitations. A road is not an invitation to leave it elsewhere than at its end.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n The courts of our country have sharply divided as to the principles of law applicable to 'attractive nuisance' cases, of which this one is typical. \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 277]\n\u00a0\n At the head of one group, from 1873 until the decision of to-day, has stood the Supreme Court of the United States, applying what has been designated as the 'humane' doctrine. Quite distinctly the courts of Massachusetts have stood at the head of the other group, applying what has been designated as a 'hard doctrine'-the 'Draconian doctrine.' Thompson on Negligence, vol. I,  1027 to 1054, inclusive, especially sections 1027, 1047 and 1048. Cooley on Torts (3d Ed.) p. 1269 et seq.\n In 1873, in Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, this court, in a turntable case, in a unanimous decision, strongly approved the doctrine that he who places upon his land, where children of tender years are likely to go, a construction or agency, in its nature attractive, and therefore a temptation, to such children, is culpably negligent if he does not take reasonable care to keep them away, or to see that such dangerous thing is so guarded that they will not be injured by it when following the instincts and impulses of childhood, of which all mankind has notice. The court also held that where the facts are such that different minds may honestly draw different conclusions from them, the case should go to the jury.\n Twenty years later the principle of this Stout Case was elaborately re-examined and unreservedly affirmed, again in a unanimous decision in Union Pacific Railway Co. v. McDonald, \n152 U.S. 262\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 619. In each of these cases the contention that a child of tender years must be held to the same understanding of the law with respect to property rights as an adult and that therefore, under the circumstances of each, the child injured was a trespasser, was considered and emphatically rejected. The attractiveness of the unguarded construction or agency-the temptation of it to children-is an invitation to enter the premises that purges their technical trespass. These have been regarded as leading cases on the subject for now almost fifty years and have been widely followed by state and federal \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 278]\n\u00a0\n courts-by the latter so recently as Heller v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. ( C. C. A.) 265 Fed. 192, and American Ry. Express Co. v. Crabtree (C. C. A.) 271 Fed. 287.\n The dimensions of the pool of poisoned water were about 20x45 feet. It was 2 1\/2 to 3 feet deep in part and in part 10 or more feet deep. A photograph in the record gives it the appearance of an attractive swimming pool, with brick sides and the water coming nearly to the top of the wall. The water is described by the witnesses as appearing to be clear and pure, and, on the hot summer day on which the children perished, attactively cool.\n This pool is indefinitely located within a tract of land about 1,000 feet wide by 1,200 feet long, about which there had not been any fence whatever for many years, and there was no sign or warning of any kind indicating the dangerous character of the water in the pool. There were several paths across the lot, a highway ran within 100 to 120 feet of the pool, and a railway track was not far away. The land was immediately adjacent to a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, with dwelling houses not far distant from it. The testimony shows that not only the two boys who perished had been attracted to the pool at the time, but that there were two or three other children with them, whose cries attracted men who were passing near by, who, by getting into the water, succeeded in recovering the dead body of one child and in rescuing the other in such condition that, after lingering for a day or a two, he died. The evidence shows that the water in the pool was highly impregnated with sulphuric acid and zinc sulphate, which certainly caused the death of the children, and that the men who rescued the boys suffered seriously, one of them for as much as two weeks, from the effects of the poisoned water.\n The case was given to the jury in a clear and comprehensive charge, and the judgment of the District Court upon the verdict was affirmed by the Circuit Court of \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 279]\n\u00a0\n Appeals. The court charged the jury that if the water in the pool was not poisonous and if the boys were simply drowned there could be no recovery, but that if it was found, that the defendant knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known that the water was impregnated with poison, that children were likely to go to its vicinity, that it was in appearance clear and pure and attractive to young children as a place for bathing, and that the death of the children was caused by its alluring appearance and by its poisonous character, and because no protection or warning was given against it, the case came within the principle of the 'attractive nuisance' or 'turntable' cases and recovery would be allowed.\n This was as favorable a view of the federal law, as it has been until to-day, as the petitioner deserved. The Supreme Court of Illinois, on the authority of the Stout Case, held a city liable for the death of a child drowned in a similar pool of water not poisoned. City of Pekin v. McMahon, 151 Ill. 141, 39 N. E. 484, 27 L. R. A. 206, 45 Am. St. Rep. 114.\n The facts, as stated, make it very clear that in the view most unfavorable to the plaintiffs below there might be a difference of opinion between candid men as to whether the pool was so located that the owners of the land should have anticipated that children might frequent its vicinity, whether its appearance and character rendered it attractive to childish instincts so as to make it a temptation to children of tender years, and whether, therefore, it was culpable negligence to maintain it in that location, unprotected and without warning as to its poisonous condition. This being true, the case would seem to be one clearly for a jury, under the ruling in the Stout Case, supra.\n Believing as I do that the doctrine of the Stout and McDonald Cases, giving weight to, and making allowance, as they do, for, the instincts and habitual conduct of children of tender years, is a sound doctrine, calculated to \n\n[258 U.S. 268, 280]\n\u00a0\n make men more reasonably considerate of the safely of the children of their neighbors, than will the harsh rule which makes trespassers of little children which the court is now substituting for it, I cannot share in setting aside the verdict of the jury in this case, approved by the judgments of two courts, upon what is plainly a disputed question of fact and in thereby overruling two decisions which have been accepted as leading authorities for half a century, and I therefore dissent from the judgment and opinion of the court.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DAY concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIGLIOTTI v. COM. OF PENNSYLVANIA(1922)\nNo. 530\nArgued: March 14, 1922Decided: April 10, 1922\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank Davis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., and H. S. Dumbauld, of Uniontown, Pa., for plaintiff in error.[ Vigliotti v. Com. of Pennsylvania \n258 U.S. 403\n (1922) ]\n\n\n[258 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. E. Alter, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for the Commonwealth of pennsylvania. \n\n[258 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the court of quarter sessions of Fayette county, Pa., Vigliotti was found guilty of selling, during the spring of 1920, spirituous liquor without a license, in violation of section 15 of the Act of May 13, 1887 ( P. L. 108), known as the Brooks Law (Pa. St. 1920,  14007). The liquor so sold was a preparation called 'Jamaica ginger,' containing 88 per cent. of alcohol. The defendant claimed seasonably that the state law as applied deprived him of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, because the sales complained of had been made after January 16, 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment became effective, after which the Volstead Act was the only law applicable to sales of intoxicating liquors. This claim was overruled by the trial court; the defendant was sentenced; the judgment was affirmed by both the Superior Court (75 Pa. Sup. Ct. 366) and the Supreme Court of the state (271 Pa. 10, 115 Atl. 20), and the case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended ( Comp. St.  1214). The question presented for our decision is whether the provision of the Brooks Law here applied had been superseded by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act (41 Stat. 305).\n The Brooks Law, as construed by the courts of the state. prohibits every sale of spirituous liquor without a license, excepting only such sales as are made by druggists, and these are forbidden to sell intoxicating liquors except on prescription of a regular physician. The law applies, however small the percentage of alcohol, and although the liquor is not intoxicating. It applies to liquor sold solely for industrial uses. It does not purport to confer upon any one anywhere the right to a license, nor does it authorize the sale of liquor in any city or county having a special prohibitory law. It merely grants to the appropriate officials, where such authority exists, discretion to \n\n[258 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n give or to withhold the license under the conditions prescribed. In case of an indictment for selling without a license, a sale is presumed to be unlawful, and the burden is on the defendant to show the authority on which he acted. It is thus primarily a prohibitory law, and its prohibitory features are not so dependent upon those respecting license as to be swept away by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. The Supreme Court declared further that:\n'The Brooks Law still survives as Pennsylvania's own police power method of officially listing and adequately controlling the customary sources of general supply and distribution, to the peoples within her borders, of those kinds of liquors among which intoxicating beverages are usually found, and she may thus assist in prohibiting their illegal use as such.' 271 Pa. 10, 115 Atl. 22.\n\n We, of course, accept as controlling the construction given to the statute by the highest court of the state. The question before us is whether, so construed, the statute violates the federal Constitution.\n The Brooks Law as thus construed does not purport to authorize or sanction anything which the Eighteenth Amendment or the Volstead Act prohibits. And there is nothing in it which conflicts with any provision of either. It is merely an additional instrument which the state supplies in the effort to make prohibition effective. That the state may by appropriate legislation exercise its police power to that end was expressly provided in section 2 of the amendment which declares that 'Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.' National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 387\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 588. That the Brooks Law, as construed, is appropriate legislation, is likewise clear. To prohibit every sale of spirituous liquors, except by licensed persons, may certainly aid in preventing sales for beverages purposes of liquor containing as much as one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol, and that is what the Volstead Act \n\n[258 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n prohibits. If the Brooks Law as construed had been enacted the day after the adoption of the amendment, it would obviously have been 'appropriate legislation.' It is not less so because it was already in existence.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLACE v. U S(1922)\nNo. 118\nArgued: January 27, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 541, 542]\n\u00a0\n Claiming to be a Colonel in the Quartermaster Corps of the United States Army, the appellant sued in the Court of Claims to recover $6,580. 67 salary and commutation of quarters from February 13, 1918, until March 12, 1919. His petition was dismissed.\n The President, on the recommendation of the Secretary of War, issued an order dismissing the appellant from the service by General Orders No. 17, of February 13, 1918, of which he was notified on the same day. The United States was then at war with Germany. On March 1, 1918, the President sent to the Senate the following nominations:\n'I nominate the officers named for promotion in the Army of the United States:\n\n'Quartermaster Corps\n\n'To be Colonels\n\n'Lieutenant Colonel Robert S. Smith, Quartermaster Corps, with rank from February 14th, 1918\n\n\n\n'Lieutenant Colonel Richmond McA. Scofield, Quartermaster Corps, with rank from February 23rd, 1918.\n\n'To be Lieutenant Colonels\n\n'Major Morton J. Henry, Quartermaster Corps, with rank from February 14th, 1918.\n\n'Major William Elliott, Quartermaster Corps, with rank from February 23, 1918.'\n\n These officers were confirmed March 8, 1918. This filled the complement of 21 officers allowed by law in the grade of Colonel in the Quartermaster Corps.\n On July 16th appellant made a formal application in writing for trial by courtmartial, setting forth under oath that he had been wrongfully dismissed. On September 14, 1918, the trial was refused by the Secretary and no court-martial was convened.\n Prior to June 24, 1918, plaintiff did not have knowledge of section 1230, Revised Statutes. He had been advised after his dismissal that he could seek relief through Congress. \n\n[257 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. Stanley Hinrichs and Frank S. Bright, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The President acted under the 118th Article of War, which provides in part (39 Stat. 619, 650, 669) that\n'No officer shall be discharged or dismissed from the service except by order of the President or by sentence of a general court-martial; and in time of peace no officers shall be dismissed except in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial or in mitigation thereof.' (Comp. St.  2308a). \n\n[257 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n This Article is only a re-enactment of the 99th Article of War contained in the Revised Statutes. Section 1342, R. S. Both are, therefore, to be read with section 1230, R. S., which is as follows:\n\n'When any officer, dismissed by order of the President, makes, in writing, an application for trial, setting forth, under oath, that he has been wrongfully dismissed, the President shall, as soon as the necessities of the service may permit, convene a court-martial, to try such officer on the charges on which he shall have been dismissed. And if a court-martial is not so convened within six months from the presentation of such application for trial, or if such court, being convened, does not award dismissal or death as the punishment of such officer, the order of dismissal by the President shall be void.' ( Comp. St.  2003).\n\n Appellant claims that by the failure to grant him a court-martial, his dismissal under section 1230 was rendered void ab initio and that he is still a Colonel.\n The first question is whether he ceased to be a member of the Army by the nomination and confirmation of another which filled the complement of officers allowed by law in his rank. It is clear from the reasoning of this court in the case of Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, that the words 'by order of the President,' in section 1230, R. S., supra, refer to a dismissal by the President alone, and do not include the removal of an officer by the appointment and confirmation of his successor.\n Before the Civil War there was no restriction upon the President's power to remove an officer of the Army or Navy. The principle that the power of removal was incident to the power of appointment was early determined by the Senate to involve the conclusion that, at least in absence of restrictive legislation, the President, though he could not appoint without the consent of the Senate, could remove without such consent in the case of any officer whose tenure was not fixed by the Constitution. \n\n[257 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n The first legislative restriction upon this power was enacted March 3, 1865, by the very provision we are here considering (13 Stat. 489), which subsequently became section 1230, Revised Statutes. Thereafter on July 13, 1866 (14 Stat. 92), Congress took away altogether the power of the President to dismiss an officer of the Army or Navy in time of peace, except in pursuance of a court martial sentence or in commutation thereof. After that, in the controversy between President Johnson and the Senate, the tenure of office act was passed which cut down the power of the President to remove civil officers. Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 430. The validity of these acts has never been directly passed on by this court in any case. The question has been expressly saved. Parsons v. The United States, \n167 \nU.S. 324, 339\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 880.\n While, thus, the validity and effect of statutory restrictions upon the power of the President alone to remove officers of the Army and Navy and civil officers have been the subject of doubt and discussion, it is settled, McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n; Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, 26 L. ed. 462; Keyes v. United States, \n109 U.S. 336\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 202; Mullan v. United States, \n140 U.S. 240\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 788, that the President with the consent of the Senate may effect the removal of an officer of the Army or Navy by the appointment of another to his place, and that none of the limitations in the statutes affects his power of removal when exercised by and with the consent of the Senate. Indeed the same ruling has been made as to civil officers. Parsons v. United States, \n167 U.S. 324\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 880.\n The question here then is whether the Senate joined the President in his removal of the appellant. That the President intended to separate him from the Army is, of course, plain. What are we to infer from the Senate's action in confirming appointments by the President which filled the complement of officers of the rank of appellant allowed by law? The appointment of Lieut. Colonel \n\n[257 U.S. 541, 546]\n\u00a0\n Robert Smith was made two weeks after the announcement in General Orders of the dismissal of appellant and was made to confer the rank as of February 14th, the day after appellant was dismissed. The appointment did not say, as is usual in such cases, vice Wallace dismissed; but the facts of record in the War Department and in General Orders leave no doubt of the intention of the President and the Department in that regard. This raises the inquiry what we should presume as to the knowledge of the Senate in the matter. We can take judicial notice of the fact that nominations to office sent to the Senate are usually referred to the appropriate committee for investigation and report. In this case, the nomination would have been sent to the Military Committee which considers each appointment and is, of course, charged with the duty of inquiring into the existence of a vacancy to which an appointment can be made, as well as into its wisdom and propriety. Communication between the Department and the Committee dealing with such appointments is easy and frequent. We must presume, therefore, in the absence of any showing to the contrary, that the Senate was advised of the facts in respect to the nomination of Lieut. Colonel Smith and that it intended to supply the vacancy occasioned by the dismissal of appellant. Otherwise we must conclude that the Senate Committee was recommending, and the Senate was deliberately voting confirmation of a nomination to a place for which there was no provision by law. We must assume that the confirming authorities knew the legal complement of Colonels in the Quartermaster Corps and how many they had already confirmed for that office. They must, therefore, have made inquiry and been assured as to the vacancy which would make Colonel Smith's nomination and rank from February 14, 1918, proper.\n It is urged that if the dismissal of appellant was rendered void ab initio, as contended, the effect was to restore \n\n[257 U.S. 541, 547]\n\u00a0\n him to office, and he was entitled to pay although the lawful complement of officers had been exceeded. To sustain this view, Quackenbush v. The United States, \n177 U.S. 20\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 530, is cited. It fails entirely to do so. On the contrary, it shows that in order to authorize pay for an officer whose place has been filled by nomination and confirmation of the Senate, there must be special legislative authority.\n This is conclusive and renders it unnecessary to consider whether appellant lost his right to apply for a court martial under section 1230 by waiting five months, a question not free from doubt, considering the exigencies and need for dispatch in time of war. See Norris v. United States, \n257 U.S. 77\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 9, and Nicholas v. United States, \n257 U.S. 71\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 7, decided by this court November 7, 1921.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLACE v.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Counsel for the appellant object to the presumption we indulge in our opinion in this case that the Senate must have known of the dismissal of Wallace when it confirmed the nomination of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Smith, whose appointment and confirmation filled the place considered vacant by Wallace's dismissal. They insist that the absence of knowledge by the Senate of Wallace's removal was conceded by the government in both the Court of Claims and here. What the government brief in this court said was that it did not appear that the Senate was advised. But appellant's counsel produce evidence from the record in the Court of Claims upon which they ask that the case be remanded to the Court of Claims to make a finding on this point. Let us concede for the sake of the argument, without deciding, that is properly a matter of evidence dehors the record, and of a finding thereon. The chief item of evidence on which the motion is based is a statement in the record below that--\n'on or before February 21, 1918, it was the practice of the Adjutant General's office to nominate an officer vice the particular officer whose promotion or separation from the service caused the vacancy, and that, after February 21, 1918, the practice of indicating the specific vacancy was discontinued on the recommendation of the Executive Clerk of the Senate.'\n\n The contention of the defendant on this showing is that the Senate adopted the practice of confirming appointments to vacancies made by the President without investigation into the cause of the vacancies because of the exigencies of war and the great number of appointments. We do not see that if such facts were found, it would alter \n\n[258 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n our necessary conclusion. The Senate in confirming nominations is not exercising a judicial but an executive function. It does not have to give a hearing or make an investigation before lawful action, and if it chooses to accept the President's nomination as assurance that there is a vacancy to which the appointment proposed can be made, and acts on that assurance, the legal effect of the confirmation is not affected.\n Petition for rehearing and the motion to remand are denied. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWARD & GOW v.

In the latter department, which alone requires mention, there are 307 employees, including executives, office workers, news stand inspectors, who travel single over the different elevated and subway lines, to inspect displays and see that the sales booths are properly kept, chauffeurs, who drive trucks transporting merchandise from headquarters downtown in Manhattan to the different subway and elevated stations, 18 porters for loading and unloading the trucks at headquarters, and various others, among the 125 news stand salesmen, each of whom is stationed at a booth in a subway or elevated railway station, and whose work is separate from that of other employees. Each of them goes directly to his stand in the morning, and thence to his home in the evening, and his duties consist of keeping a display of papers, magazines, candies, and other small articles in proper order, selling them across the counter, keeping an account of sales, and turning in in collections. The only other employees with whom a salesman comes in contact \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n are the inspector and the chauffeur, who brings supplies from the truck, either down to the subway or up to the elevated platform, and passes them across the counter to the salesman.\n Krinsky was one of these salesmen, stationed in a booth at a subway station in the Bronx. The booth was a steel structure 12 feet long, 8 feet wide or high, 2 1\/2 feet deep, located against a wall 10 feet from the edge of the platform. In order to keep the booth and its contents free from dust, and his hands in a proper condition of cleanliness, water was kept for convenience in the booth, in a pail furnished by the employer, to be emptied by Krinsky when necessary, and replenished with water obtained from a washroom two flights of stairs above the train level. He was in the habit of emptying the water in the morning upon the tracks of the subway and replenishing the supply before starting business. One morning in February, 1919, while thus emptying the water as usual Krinsky was struck upon the side of the head by an approaching train, his skull was fractured, and he sustained disabling personal injuries, which the Industrial Commission found were accidental and arose out of and in the course of the employment.\n An award of compensation made by the commission was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (Krinsky v. Ward, 193 App. Div. 557, 184 N. Y. Supp. 443), and its judgment was affirmed without opinion by the Court of Appeals. The record was remitted to the Appellate Division, which made the order and judgment of the Court of Appeals its own, and to it, as custodian of the record, the present writ of error was directed.\n It was not disputed in the state courts, nor is it questioned here, that in the merchandising department of plaintiff in error there were more than four 'workmen or operatives,' within the meaning of second group 45 of section 2 of the Compensation Law. Evidently the porters were \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n such, and clearly were 'engaged in the same business' with the salesmen, for they loaded the trucks which carried the merchandise from the central depot to the booths. The Appellate Division held that the salesmen, although not 'workmen or operatives,' nevertheless were within the protection of the statute. Reference was made to the definition of 'employee' in subdivision 4 of section 3, amended by Laws 1916, c. 622, and Laws 1917, c. 705, so as to include any one in the service of an employer whose principal business is that of conducting a hazardous employment, construed in previous decisions as bringing within the protection of the statute all employees accidentally injured in the performance of duties incidental to the prosecution of a business defined as hazardous, even though such duties were not a part of the characteristic process or operation forming the basis of the group (Matter of Dose v. Moehle Lithographic Co., 221 N. Y. 401, 405, 117 N. E. 616; Spang v. Broadway Brewing & Malting Co., 182 App. Div. 443, 169 N. Y. Supp. 574; Joyce v. Eastman Kodak Co., 182 App. Div. 354, 170 N. Y. Supp. 401), and it was held that, since this rule applied to all the other groups defined in section 2, it must be applied in respect to second group 45. That the view of the Court of Appeals was substantially the same appears, not only from its affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division without questioning its reasoning, but from the opinion delivered by the Court of Appeals itself in a case decided at the same time with this. Matter of Europe v. Addison Amusements, 231 N. Y. 105, 131 N. E. 750. Europe was conductor of a famous band of musicians who, after a military service with the American Forces in France, went upon a concert tour throughout the United States, under employment by Addison Amusements, Inc. With the band of 65 pieces there were 4 or more workmen or operatives, employed to accompany it, arrange platforms, chairs, and scenery, handle baggage, etc. Europe himself, although an employee, was not among those described as 'workmen \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n or operatives,' nor engaged in hazardous work, ordinarily so called. During an intermission in the program of a concert he was stabbed and killed by a drummer of the band. The Court of Appeals, sustaining the Industrial Commission and the Appellate Division, held that he was within the protection of second group 45.\n In the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we are bound by the construction of the state law adopted by its court of last resort; hence for present purposes it must be taken as settled that the Legislature intended the compensation law as amended to apply to an employee in Krinsky's situation, precisely as if it were so declared in the words of the statute. Our function is confined to determining whether, as so construed and as applied to the concrete facts of the case, the state contravenes the limitations imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment upon state action.\n Under the due process of law clause, plaintiff in error contends that the validity of compulsory Workmen's Compensation Acts depends upon the inherently hazardous character of the occupations covered; that a legislative declaration that a certain employment is hazardous is not conclusive; and that to impose upon the employer, as is said to be done in this instance, a liability to make compensation to any employee out of hundreds whose occupations are nonhazardous, because 4 or more workmen or operatives may happen be regularly employed in the same business, or in or about the same establishment, although not brought into contact with the injured employee, and where, to use the words of counsel, 'his injury was the consequence, not of any hazard inherent in his employment, but of gross personal negligence, or incredible folly that would have brought injury to any person in any occupation whatever,' is so altogether unreasonable as to be wanting in due process. The argument rests upon the curious misconception that the Legislature \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n regarded the workmen or operatives as the sole source of danger to those engaged in the same business with them, and upon the assumption, equally untenable, that the occupation of a salesman at a subway station, protected ordinarily by the comparative security of a steel booth, but called upon at times, in the line of duty, to go into the moving througs of passengers and into close proximity to the rails upon which locomotives and trains are moving, is free from inherent hazard to the salesman.\n That Krinsky's injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment was found by the commission, whose findings and decision were affirmed by both courts, and must be conclusive upon us, unless ascertained to be without support in the evidence, including any reasonable inference that may be drawn from it.\n As has been seen, he was charged with the sale of a stock of merchandise belonging to the employer, and for this purpose was stationed in a booth placed upon the platform of a subway station, about 10 feet from the tracks. There was evidence showing that he had sole responsibility for the care and display of this merchandise, which, of course, he was to sell to the passing throngs of train passengers, and was required to keep the booth, the stock, and his own person in a cleanly condition. The employer supplied a container for water to be used for the latter purpose, and naturally this was kept in the booth, emptied and replenished by Krinsky as occasion required. He was not instructed how this should be done, and the state commission and courts reasonably might infer that he was at liberty to do it in the most convenient and expeditious mode. To say, as is suggested, that he was constrained to close and lock the booth, leave it, and go up two flights, either by elevator or staircase, in order to empty the water, with consequent interruption of business in the meantime (30 minutes, according to the evidence), when the same object could be accomplished \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 512]\n\u00a0\n in a few moments and without closing the booth by stepping 10 feet across the platform to the edge of the track and there emptying the water, relying upon a volunteer assistant to bring a fresh supply, would be to place a strained and unreasonable construction upon the scope of implied duties. True, he might have avoided the particular hazard that overtook him, had he chosen the tedious journey two flights up and down again, instead of the half dozen steps across the platform to the edge of the track. Whether, in the hurry and bustle of a subway crowd, the nature of Krinsky's duties required or permitted him to follow the slower course, or even that it involved less probability of personal injury than the one habitually adopted, are questions upon which the commission and the state courts are peculiarly fitted to draw correct inferences. Certainly we are not warranted in holding that the findings are without support in the evidence.\n A sufficient vindication of compulsory Workmen's Compensation and Employers' Liability Acts, as it has seemed to this court, is found in the public interest of the state in the lives and personal security of those who are under the protection of its laws, from which it follows that, when men are employed in hazardous occupations for gain, it is within the power of the state to charge the pecuniary losses arising from disabling or fatal personal injury, to some extent, at least, against the industry after the manner of casualty insurance, instead of allowing them to rest where they may happen to fall, upon the particular injured employees or their dependents, and to this end to require that the employer-he who organizes and directs the enterprise, hires the workmen, fixes the wages, sets a price upon the product, receives the gross proceeds, pays the costs and the losses, and takes for his reward the net profits, if any-shall make or secure to be made such compensation as reasonably may be prescribed, to be paid in \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 513]\n\u00a0\n the event of the injury or death of one of those employed, instead of permitting the entire risk to be assumed by the individuals immediately affected. In general, as in the New York law, provisions for compulsory compensation are made to apply only to those employed in hazardous occupations, where it may be contemplated by both parties in advance that sooner or later some of those employed probably will sustain accidental injury in the course of the employment, but where nobody can know in advance which particular employees or how many will be the victims, or how serious will be the injuries. New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 202, et seq., 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 239\n, 243 S.-244, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 \nU.S. 400, 420\n, 422 S.-426, 39 Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537\n\n\n That there was inherent hazard in Krinsky's occupation is conclusively shown by the fact that in the course of it he received a serious and disabling personal injury arising out of it. That the event might have been foreseen is demonstrated by the way in which it occurred, not to speak of the fact that the Legislature actually foresaw it and made provision for it, long before it occurred. Hence there was no undue deprivation of the liberty or property of plaintiff in error, or his right to acquire property in lawful business, in the act of the Legislature which required him to take warning and make provision against the event which afterwards in fact occurred.\n It will be seen that while, by the terms of the statute, the employment of 'four or more workmen or operatives regularly, in the same business or in or about the same establishment,' etc., apparently is indicated as the basis of the new group-one rather frequently adopted in laws of this character, Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 U.S. 571\n, 574, etc ., 35 Sup. Ct. 167; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 \nU.S. 152, 159\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 227-in effect, by the construction adopted by the state court and binding upon us, the employees \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 514]\n\u00a0\n brought within the compensation features of the act include not only the 'four or more workmen or operatives,' or others injured through contact with them, but any and all other employees in the same business, who may suffer accidental and disabling injury arising out of and in the course of their employment, although due to incidental hazards not typical of the group.\n The contention that by this construction second group 45 has been extended beyond the limit allowable consistently with due process of law, and 'has been applied in this case to an employment with no inherent hazard whatever,' rests upon an assumption of fact disproved by Krinsky's experience. Were it not so, the argument is self-destructive. The statute requires the employer to make or secure compensation for the disability or death of an employee only where it results from accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. Where the employment is entirely free from inherent hazard to the employee, the statute imposes no responsibility upon the employer, and hence cannot substantially interfere with his liberty or property, with or without 'due process of law.' Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 \nU.S. 400, 429\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537.\n Reducing the argument by omitting the extravagant statement that so plainly leads to absurdity, it may be outlined thus: That Krinsky's occupation was no more hazardous than that of millions of residents of the metropolitan district, who daily make use of the subways and elevated railways in going to and from their work; that there had been no such accident among plaintiff in error's employees in 20 years of operation; and that it is unreasonably and unnecessarily burdensome to require the employer to either maintain compensation insurance at heavy annual premiums, or deposit securities with the state to guarantee payment of compensation benefits, where the probability of injury is so slight. The answer is \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 515]\n\u00a0\n easy: To the self-insurer no liability accrues, except as disabling injuries actually occur; the giving of security, a reasonable regulation in aid of the general scheme (New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 208-209, 37 Sup. Ct. 247), does not increase the obligation. To the employer, who insures, presumably the premiums will not exceed a reasonable estimate of the risk; to him who insures in the state fund, there is an assurance of equivalency in the public administration of the fund under section 90 et seq., of the law, especially the duty imposed upon the state board by section 95 to keep separate accounts as to each group, so as to determine equitable rates, to rearrange the groups by withdrawing any employment embraced in one group and transferring it wholly or in part to another, to set up new groups at discretion, to determine the hazards of the different classes composing each group, and to fix the premiums therefor, based upon the total pay roll and number of employees in each class of employment, at the lowest possible rate consistent with the maintenance of a solvent insurance fund and the creation of a reasonable surplus and reserve. A similar system was sustained in Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 241-243, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D. 642.\n The fallacy of the argument for holding it arbitrary and unreasonable to impose upon the employer the burden of making compensation in employments where injury is improbable and difficult to be foreseen should be fairly apparent when it is pointed out that, in the absence of the statute, not a part, but the entire loss consequent upon a disabling or fatal injury arising out of and in the course of the employment would have to be assumed and borne by the disabled employee or his dependents, just as under the statute they still must bear all beyond the scheduled compensation. Yet they have no better opportunity to foresee the casualty than the employer, and (in the judgment of the Legislature) less opportunity to make provision \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 516]\n\u00a0\n against it. The common-law rule, requiring the employee to assume the risk, and to take account of it in advance when fixing the wages, recognized dimly that the cost of industrial accidents ought to be borne by the industry, but failed to effectuate such a purpose, partly for the very reason that the hazard could not be estimated by the individual in advance, nor the loss provided against without co-operation.\n The extension of the Compensation Law by addition of second group 45, following the recent modification of the definition of 'employee,' far from demonstrating in its application to Krinsky's case unreasonable, arbitrary action by the state through its legislative department shows rather intelligent foresight, an anticipation, based upon practical experience in the operation of the law as it stood before, that, however little foreseen by persons immediately concerned, accidental disabling injuries inevitably would occur in occupations not previously classed as hazardous, and a reasonable determination to include them in a scheme already found to be free from constitutional objection in its general application.\n We have sufficiently indicated grounds for holding that the statute as thus extended is not repugnant to the guaranty of 'due process of law' in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n That it does not deny to plaintiff in error 'the equal protection of the laws' is equally clear. The argument that it does proceeds upon the untenable theory that, if hazard be imputed to the employment of 'four or more workmen or operatives regularly, in the same business or in or about the same establishment,' its effect in the scheme of compensation must be confined to the hazards attributable to group labor. In Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 575\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167; and Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 \nU.S. 152, 159\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 227, a somewhat similar classification was sustained, but not upon any limited \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 517]\n\u00a0\n ground. In the framing of so far-reaching a scheme of legislation, dealing with occupations so diverse, necessarily a wide range must be accorded to legislative discretion about defining the groups to which it shall apply. Lines must be drawn, and it is not to be assumed that they have been drawn without good reason. The difference between the larger and the smaller establishments may be recognized as a basis of classification in legislation affecting the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, as was held in Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, supra. So, the minimum number in a single employ may be regarded, we think, in arranging a system designed to distribute the burden of industrial accident losses with a view to the ability of the industry to bear it. Nor need a law framed on the lines of that under consideration confine the compensation narrowly to typical cases, where it is confined, as here, to cases actually arising in the course of gainful employment, and due to inherent hazards of the occupation. Second group 45 applies impartially to all employers who come within the descriptive terms; the employment of 'four or more workmen or operatives regularly' is treated as the nucleus of a business probably involving personal hazard to some of those employed; and the same rule of construction is applied to this as to other groups.\n But, it is insisted, neither stare decisis nor ita lex scripta est furnishes an adequate reply to a constitutional objection. This court sustained the New York Workmen's Compensation Law, and the kindred statutes of Washington and Arizona, fundamentally upon the ground of the hazardous nature of the occupations covered. if that ground is defensible at all-so runs the argument-the system must be confined to occupations actually hazardous in their nature; a legislative definition is not sufficient, nor is the occurrence of a single accident, much less one so singular and so little related to his general duty as that \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 518]\n\u00a0\n which befell Krinsky, adequate proof of occupational hazard. It might occur to anybody, any day, on his way downtown to business, were he not especially careful. This is too fantastic a definition of 'inherent risk' to form the basis of a law which must conform to standards of reasonableness. And again, how can the classification resorted to in second group 45 be sustained as reasonable, within the requirements either of the 'due process of law' or the 'equal protection of the laws' provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment? The occupation of a salesman stationed alone far uptown in the Bronx does not become hazardous simply because four or more porters art regularly employed at headquarters downtown in Manhattan. How can we accept the reason suggested by the Court of Appeals in the Europe Case, supra (somewhat at random, it should be said, and when the court, by its own confession, was not required quired to test its adequacy), that a business not ordinarily hazardous becomes such at times when manual work is done or machinery operated in connection with its main purpose? This would be an assumption contrary to common experience, especially as applied to manual work downtown in Manhattan and the occupation of a single salesman;-it might as well have been 500 clerks, uptown in the Bronx. What reason is there for imposing compulsory liability upon the employer of salesmen or clerks in the Bronx simply because he finds it convenient to employ at the same time, but in separate duties, 4 workmen or operatives in Manhattan? He might dismiss the workmen- his neighbor and business competitor might dispense with such workmen-and thus gain immunity from the statute. Classification is permissible in legislation only when based on reasonable grounds. This peculiar grouping is classification gone wild. It cannot be sustained by the simple and obvious tests applied in Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, supra, and kindred cases. \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 519]\n\u00a0\n This, we believe, is a fair summary of the reasoning expressed or suggested in the brief and in the oral argument of plaintiff in error. We have not minimized its force, and concede that, if it is to be taken seriously, it seems to subject second group 45, and the Compensation Law as extended by this and other recent amendments, to a test that ought to be responded to satisfactorily, if the validity of the statute is to be made clear.\n Many of the propositions may be admitted-for the purpose of the argument only-as correct according to a priori standards, and unanswerable without resort to the tests of experience. We shall endeavor, with some care, to answer from the latter standpoint, not contenting ourselves with some rather too obvious replies already suggested.\n The New York Workmen's Compensation Law by its terms is based upon the existence of actual, not hypothetical, inherent hazards confronting employees in gainful occupations; was sustained as valid by this court upon that ground in New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, supra; has been administered by the state constantly on that basis; and second group 45 shows no clear evidence of a purpose to depart from it. We leave wholly aside, as not here involved, the question whether the new group could be sustained on any other basis. Any question about the validity of an act purporting to impose compulsory liability upon employers for losses due to occupational hazards, where there really are no occupational hazards, may safely be left until such a case is presented.\n Next, we agree that, in a test of constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment, the question whether there is inherent hazard in an occupation or a group of occupations is not to be settled conclusively by a legislative declaration or by an empty form of words. We add, it is not to be settled, hardly is affected, by an arbitrary a priori statement, unaided by the light of experience in \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 520]\n\u00a0\n which the Legislature acted, that there is absolutely no inherent hazard in an occupation, especially where it appears that even one employee has been seriously injured while acting in the line of his duties in a manner that easily might have been anticipated by the employer, or the inspector who supervised his work, to say nothing of the employee himself, had either of these exercised the ordinary care of the reasonably prudent man to whom the common law so frequently resorts for a standard. The Legislature, in the New York system, is justified in extending the benefits of the Compensation Law as far as it reasonably may determine occupational hazard to extend-to the 'vanishing point' as it were-and any lines of group definition it may adopt, if easily understood and applied, cannot reasonably be called 'an empty form of words' merely because they do not carry on their fact the reasons for adopting them.\n Again, we agree that (if it were necessary, as we hold it is not, that group lines should explain themselves) the suggestion quoted from the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Europe Case hardly offers a satisfactory explanation of the new group, reasonably definite and substantial in its basis, within the tests of the Fourteenth Amendment. But this court, while bound by the construction of the statute adopted by the state court of last resore-that being a question of state law-is not concluded by its reasoning, but must exercise an independent judgment, when called upon to determine the federal question whether the act as construed and applied, is repugnant to the restrictions of the amendment. Any suggestion from the state court in aid of the act fairly may be accepted; but a suggestion having an adverse effect, while entitled to respectful consideration, is not to be taken as weakening the action taken by the state through its legislative branch, or as furnishing an exclusive statement of the grounds upon which the Legislature acted. It \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 521]\n\u00a0\n is proper to say that in the Europe Case no question of the constitutionality of the new group 45 appears to have been presented, and the court alluded to the phraseology merely to dispose of the question of construction.\n In examining the Compensation Law and its many amendments, including the one in question, and the workings of the law as indicated by the decisions cited and others, we have been impressed again and again, to the point of complete conviction, that this act or any of its amendments is not the work of novices or bunglers. A priori reasoning has not been resorted to; there is no reliance upon generalizations or 'common knowledge'; no 'simply because'; nothing taken for granted. No case that we recall illustrates more aptly or forcibly the wisdom of the familiar rule, expressed by this court in a recent case in these terms:\n'There is a strong presumption that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience, and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds.' Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 \nU.S. 152, 157\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 227, 229 (63 L. Ed. 527).\n\n The law was passed in 1913, and re-enacted in 1914 after the taking effect of a constitutional amendment adopted under circumstances mentioned in the White Case, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 195\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247; the decision of this court was announced in March, 1917; meanwhile, administration commenced July 1, 1914, and was continued for four years prior to the enactment of second group 45; a multitude of compensation rulings, opinions of the Attorney General, and court decisions, sufficiently reported to the public, together with the administration of the state insurance fund, and a study and adoption of the plan of classifications used by private casualty insurance companies for underwriting business, may give but an inadequate impression of the informed, expert opinion upon which the Legislature might, and we fairly may presume did, draw for aid in framing the new group. \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 522]\n\u00a0\n What was it they were aiming at, and how did they seek to accomplish it? We need not be sure of hitting upon a correct, much less a complete, explanation. Upon the general presumption referred to the questioned group must stand, unless it were demonstrated to a moral certainty, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the grouping could not possibly be explained on reasonable grounds.\n Let us assume that after four years' practical experience in the operation of the Compensation Law, aided by the intensive studies of the commission, the Legislature was satisfied with the law as well suited to the needs of the people, except that it did not go far enough and left uncovered much unclassified ground, where undefined and virtually undefinable industrial hazards remained. It was desired to leave out, as before, farm laborers and domestic servants; a classification sustained upon simple grounds, doubtless far from expressing in full the reasons that had actuated the Legislature, in New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 208\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247.\n Aside from this, let us suppose it was desired to extend the benefits of the law as far as practicable from the administrative standpoint, abandon the attempt to go further in grouping occupations as hazardous because of the names by which they are described, include all remaining businesses, above a fixed minimum, in a single group, treat them all as more or less hazardous, and leave questions as to the particular degree of hazard, and the proper grouping of businesses as between themselves, to be worked out by the commission in the light of experience, according to the methods of private casualty insurance companies, as already was done with the existing groups.\n Was actual inherent hazard ignored? Not at all; rather it was treated as virtually universal, but incapable of being precisely defined or classified by fixed statutory rules in advance, and more easily treated in the light of experience; the new group was to be a part of a law which operates, \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 523]\n\u00a0\n as nearly as experience may guide, not in vacuo, but only where there is actual inherent hazard, and to the extent that it extends.\n But why begin with 'four workmen or operatives regularly employed'? Possible answer: It was necessary to begin somewhere; the Legislature must decide where; it is reasonable to believe there is some actual inherent hazard, where even as few as four workmen or operatives are employed steadily, though it be no more than may arise from the danger of their injuring each other; besides, an employer, who has as many as four workmen or operatives regularly employed, reasonably may be counted on to have a pay roll account that may be made the basis upon which to compute the premiums for state insurance; below four, the business perhaps hardly would pay the cost of administration, hardly give opportunity to distribute the loss, according to the general principle of insurance which runs throughout the Compensation Law.\n But why extend the responsibility of the employer to others in the same employ whose occupations are separate and nonhazardous? Possible answer: It is the employer himself who commingles in a single business or establishment those doing the more hazardous with those doing the less hazardous work, if it is done. If it be practicable to carry them on separate pay rolls, presumably the commission has the discretion to adjust it in fixing the amount of securities to be deposited under section 50, or the premium rate under section 95. Further possible answer: The difficulty is inherent in the subject; in years of practical experience, it had been found that in the extremely varied and complex organization of industry, disabling or fatal injuries occur when least expected, and in ways not characteristic of any particular industry described. The Legislature hardly could be called upon to predict, any more than the comployer, who was to be injured; and to confine the cost of casualty insurance strictly to those who were \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 524]\n\u00a0\n sure to be 'casualties' might baffle the efforts even of the experienced legislators who framed second group 45. Accidents cannot be relied upon to follow the symmetrical lines of group description; this is a difficulty that showed itself under the groups as they stood before, and led to the 1916 amendment of the definition of 'employee.' Even clerks and salesmen cannot, in this busy day, be confidently treated as immune from industrial hazards; if a general rule must be declared, it would be safer to say, on the basis of experience, that no occupation is free from industrial hazard, than to say that any specified occupation is free. Even the probable oversights or want of vision of the employer are an appreciable source of danger to clerks, as witness Joyce v. Eastman Kodak Co., 182 App. Div. 354, 170 N. Y. Supp. 401, where a clerk employed by a maker of photographic cameras and supplies (classed as hazardous in group 23), but engaged in clerical duties having no direct connection with the manufacture, was injured because of a defect of the chair in which she was sitting at work. A like suggestion arises in the case before us, where the employer insured the chauffeurs, who drove the trucks with merchandise to the various stations, but failed to insure the salesmen, overlooking the fact that they also occasionally were subjected to peril in the line of duty. It may be objected that these cases are not typical; but the Legislature may have realized, as an element of the problem with which they were dealing, what indeed is proverbial, that accidents do not conform to types; that they are one thing that happen 'simply because'-they are accidents. The particular cases are not imaginary; they actually occurred, and were brought to the test of the Compensation Law. The Legislature may have had the best of reasons for believing that others as strange were happening rather frequently in the great, busy, bustling population of the Empire State; that, while an individual clerk's or salesman's life and limb perhaps were less in danger than an individual \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 525]\n\u00a0\n machinist's, yet they were in appreciable danger; there were more clerks and salesmen than machinists; many times, naturally, they would be employed in the same business with machinists, or other 'workmen or operatives'; any seeming incongruity or unfairness in grouping them together under the Compensation Law may be taken care of through the operation of the law itself, according to the tests of experience; second group 45 will cost nothing, in the large sense, beyond expenses of administration, if it should happen to reach where industrial hazard is nonexistent; it will not be more burdensome than the industrial losses prove to be, where such hazards do exist.\n And so we venture to suggest again, what has been hinted before, that the common employer may have been the mysterious link between the workmen in downtown Manhattan and the 125 scattered salesmen, so far removed from the dangers of group labor. The Legislature may have found it impracticable to charge industrial losses against the industry without seeking out him to whom it falls to pay other expenses; hence took the industries as they found them actually organized, holding each employer responsible as to all in his employ 'in the same business or in or about the same establishment,' etc., leaving the Industrial Commission to determine in particular cases whether the hazards are great or small, whether the employer should be required to deposit securities in advance, in what amount, what the premium rate ought to be, and all doubtful matters, according to experience; confident that an employer competent to conduct a business requiring 'four or more workmen or operatives regularly' may be relied upon to make a profit above his pay roll, insurance premiums, and other like expenses.\n The state of New York, by constitutional amendment, has made this system due process of law for that state. \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 526]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to say that, in extending it by the addition of second group 45, the state has in the least degree exceeded the limitations imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting.\n The New York Workmen's Compensation Law provides:\n'Section 2. Application. Compensation provided for in this chapter shall be payable for injuries sustained or death incurred by employees engaged in the following hazardous employments:\n\n ...\n'Group 45. All other employments not hereinbefore enumerated carried on by any person, firm or corporation in which there are engaged or employed four or more workmen or operatives regularly, in the same business or in or about the same establishment, either upon the premises or at the plant or away from the plant of the employer, under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, except farm laborers and domestic servants.'\n\n By subdivision 4, section 3, 'employee' is defined as--\n'A person engaged in one of the occupations enumerated in section 2, or who is in the service of an employer whose principal business is that of carrying on or conducting a hazardous employment upon the premises or at the plant, or in the course of his employment away from the plant of his employer, and shall not include farm laborers or domestic servants.'\n\n In Europe v. Addison Amusements, Inc., et al., 231 N. Y. 105, 131 N. E. 750, the Court of Appeals construed these provisions and some quotations from the opinion will show their far-reaching effect. \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 527]\n\u00a0\n 'The Legislature, in section 2, has classified certain employments as hazardous, and has given the right of compensation to employees engaged in such hazardous employments.\n'By the amendment of subdivision 4,  3 (Laws 1916, c. 622,  2), an employee to be entitled to compensation is no longer required to be himself engaged at the time of accident in hazardous work. It is sufficient that he is an employee in such hazardous business. Matter of Does v. Moehle Lithographic Co., 221 N. Y. 401.\n\n'Group 45, as above quoted, was added by the Laws of 1918, c. 634,  2. The Legislature classified as hazardous employments all those occupations in which there were regularly engaged four or more workmen or operatives. It covered employments not specified in the other subdivisions. No doubt it was considered a risk to be in an employment where four or more manual laborers or operatives were engaged. It is not necessary for us finally to define or limit the words 'workmen' or 'operatives' as used in this subdivision. Generally speaking a workman is a man employed in manual labor, whether skilled or unskilled, an artificer, mechanic or artisan, and an operative is a factory hand, one who operates machinery. Webster's New International Dictionary. There is a marked distinction between a workman and an employee. Although in a general sense all workmen and operatives are employees, yet all employees are not workmen or operatives within the meaning of this law. The words 'workmen' and 'operatives' are used in their narrower meaning. Bowne v. S. W. Bowne Co., 221 N. Y. 28.\n\n'Europe, however, was an employee within the meaning of section 3, subd. 4, employed in a business or enterprise classified as hazardous, because it employed regularly four workmen or operatives. The evidence permitted the finding that the four men above named did manual work, consisting of moving scenery, arranging the stage, handling baggage and cleaning and pressing clothes. \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 528]\n\u00a0\n 'Why the Legislature should have extended by the second group of subdivision 45 the hazardous employments to any employment having four workmen or operatives is not for us to say. The courts in construing statutes are not concerned with the wisdom of the legislation. Wilson v. C. Dorflinger & Sons, 218 N. Y. 84, 86.\n\n'We do not think, however, that the Legislature has exceeded its powers of classification by this extension of hazardous employments. It may be, as above intimated, that a business not ordinarily hazardous becomes such at times when manual work is done or machinery operated in connection with its main purpose.\n\n'Whether or not Legislature can extend the benefits of compensation to all employments irrespective of workmen's hazards we are not called upon, at this time, to decide.'\n\n Apparently former opinions of this court have upheld Workmen's Compensation Acts against the claim that they destroy the right freely to contract, and thereby deprive of property without due process of law, upon the theory that the state may charge pecuniary losses arising from personal injuries against the industry, when men are employed in hazardous occupations for gain. If 'hazardous occupations' is not a mere empty phrase, there must be real hazard-legislative declaration is not enough. And hazard is something more than the mere possibility of injury which is always present.\n Opinions of the court below have so construed the challenged provisions that if a merchant, while employing 500 clerks in New York City, no one of them within the Workmen's Compensation Act, should employ 4 workmen to paint signs or nail up boxes at Buffalo, all his clerks would immediately come under the act. The occupation of a clerk stationed in New York City cannot be rendered hazardous simply because 4 workmen are employed at Buffalo. To argue that an occupation is \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 529]\n\u00a0\n hazardous because some one engaged therein has received personal injuries is not helpful. Many have suffered fatal accidents while eating, but eating could hardly be called hazardous. If, as suggested by the court below, 'it was considered a risk to be in an employment where 4 or more manual laborers or operatives were engaged' irrespective of anything else, then the assumption is contrary to common experience.\n If the state has power to declare an employer liable whenever his employee is injured, irrespective of hazard, the discussions heretofore indulged which treated hazard as important were unfortunate and misleading. But if that element can be wholly disregarded, then consideration must be given to the classification adopted by the New York statute in its relation to the equal protection clause. As often declared, classification is permissible when rational. But what possible reason is there for imposing liability in favor of 100 employees otherwise outside of the compensation statute simply because their employer has found it desirable to hire 4 men to do manual work in a shop or dig trenches miles away from the only place where the 100 serve?\n Such cases as Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 U.S. 571\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 167, and Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 U.S. 152\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 227, are not pertinent. The classifications there approved rested upon the obvious truth 'that the negligence of a fellow servant is more likely to be a cause of injury in the large establishments, employing many in their service, and that assumed risk may be different in such establishments than in smaller ones,' or upon some other distinction declared to be 'sufficiently patent, simple and familiar.'\n In the present case it is said that the plaintiff in error may be put into a peculiar group and required to compensate Krinsky solely because they employed mechanics to hammer at a bench miles away from the station where \n\n[259 U.S. 503, 530]\n\u00a0\n Krinsky sold papers, magazines, candy and chewing gum, and sometimes applied a little soap and water to his hands. I think both the due process and equal protection clauses of the amendment forbid.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA joins in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEILAND v. PIONEER IRR. CO.(1922)\n\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[259 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Delph E. Carpenter, of Greeley, Colo., and Victor E. Keyes, Fred Farrar, and Leslie E. Hubbard, all of Denver, Colo., for appellants.\n Mr. Edwin H. Park, of Denver, Colo., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants, defendants below, are citizens and officers of the state of Colorado, charged with official duties with respect to the distribution of water from streams of that state for irrigating purposes, and other citizens of Colorado, who need not be further noticed.\n The appellee, plaintiff below, a corporation organized under Nebraska laws, is the owner of an irrigating canal by which it has diverted water from the North fork of the Republican river, an interstate stream, at a point about 6 miles west of the east line of Colorado. Since 1890 one- third of the water thus obtained has been sold and used on lands in Colorado, and the remaining two-thirds carried by the canal into Nebraska has been used on lands in that state.\n This suit was commenced in 1913, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Colorado. The bill of complaint is not printed in full in the record, but the epitome of it shows that, in addition to diversity of citizenship as a basis of jurisdiction, it was averred that the right of appellee, under the Constitution of the United States, to engage in commerce between the states of Colorado and Nebraska, by transporting water from the former into the latter and there selling it for agricultural and domestic purposes, was being seriously impaired by the unconstitutional conduct of the state officials of Colorado, \n\n[259 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n in permitting, under color of the laws of that state, the wasteful use of the water by appropriators prior in right, and the use by others subsequent in right, to a valid appropriation by the appellee. There was also a general allegation that rights of appellee secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States had been invaded by the action of the appellant officials. A decree permanently enjoining this alleged unconstitutional action by the state officers was prayed for.\n In its decree the District Court found that there existed the requisite diversity of citizenship to give the court jurisdiction, and also that the 'suit was brought to obtain redress for the deprivation by defendants [appellants] of rights and privileges secured to the plaintiff [ appellee] by the Constitution and laws of the United States,' and that therefore it was a suit arising under the laws of the United States. The court found that the carrying capacity of appellee's ditch at the Nebraska state line was 29 cubic feet of water per second, that since the date of the construction of the ditch in 1890 that amount of water had been put to beneficial use in the irrigation of lands within the state of Nebraska, and that by reason of such continued beneficial use there had become vested in the appellee a property right to the continued use thereof. The Colorado officials, and their successors in office were enjoined 'from interfering with the right of plaintiff [appellee] to said water as herein adjudged and ... from treating plaintiff in the distribution of water ... otherwise than it would be treated if said canal were wholly within the state of Colorado and all lands irrigated therefrom were in said state.'\n The court declined to consider the question of the wasteful or other use of the water by other appropriators in Colorado, and, confining its decree to the one point dealt with in the injunction, expressly left open for consideration \n\n[259 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n and determination in another proceeding all other issues joined under the pleadings.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree of the District Court, and on the contention that a constitutional question is involved the case is brought here for review.\n The appellee filed a motion in this court to dismiss or affirm, which was passed to hearing on the merits.\n In support of the motion to dismiss it is argued that, although jurisdiction was invoked in the bill on sufficiently alleged federal grounds, in addition to diversity of citizenship, nevertheless both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained appellee's use and disposition of the water in Nebraska as one merely of prescriptive right, derived from 20 years of undisputed use, and not upon any federal constitutional ground, and that therefore the jurisdiction exercised rested wholly upon diversity of citizenship, and an appeal does not lie from the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120).\n The ground of federal jurisdiction, other than diversity of citizenship, being sufficiently set up in the bill, such a motion to dismiss can prevail only if the claim is so unsubstantial as to be frivolous. Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 U.S. 561\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 704; Lovell, Trustee v. Newman & Son, \n227 \nU.S. 412, 420\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 375. But such clearly was not the fact in this case.\n It is entirely clear that the essential and substantial issue in the case arose from the assertion by the appellee of the federal constitutional right to transport water, derived from an interstate stream, from Colorado into Nebraska under its priority of appropriation as of 1890, and the denial of this claim by the appellant state officers, based upon the contention that water in natural interstate streams in Colorado, having been declared by the Constitution and laws of that state to be the property of the public, dedicated to the use of the people of Colorado, the right could not be obtained by appropriation and beneficial \n\n[259 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n use, to carry such water into an adjoining state for like use, as against persons desiring to use it in Colorado, even though junior in point of date of appropriation. Both lower courts denied this contention of the state officials, appellants, and enjoined them from treating the appellee in the distribution of water otherwise than as if the state line had not existed, and the land irrigated had been wholly within the state of Colorado. It is thus plain that the decree appealed from necessarily rested, not upon Colorado laws or decisions which attempted to deny the asserted right to the use of the water in Nebraska, nor upon Nebraska laws or decisions which could not be effective in Colorado, but upon rights secured to the appellee by the Constitution of the United States. This substantial and very fundamental question being in the case, and essential to the disposition which was made of it, the motion to dismiss must be overruled.\n As to the merits of the case: In the discussion of the jurisdictional question it has been sufficiently developed that the essential controversy here involved is whether priority of appropriation of water, from the part of an interstate stream in Colorado, for beneficial use on lands in Nebraska, into which state the stream in a state of nature flows, gives superiority of right over later appropriation also made in Colorado from the same stream, but for use in that state.\n Both of the lower courts held that the presence of the state line did not affect the superiority of right and enjoined the Colorado state officials from treating the appellee in the distribution of water otherwise than it would be treated if the canal were wholly within the state of Colorado and all the lands irrigated therefrom were in that state.\n The question thus presented is so fully disposed of on principle and authority in the opinion of the court this day announced in No. 3 original, State of Wyoming v. State of Colorado et al., 259 U. S. \n\n[259 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n 419, 42 Sup. Ct. 552, 66 L. Ed. --, that further discussion of it would be superfluous, and upon the authority of that decision the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL CO. v. LOUISVILLE & N R CO(1922)\nNo. 259\nArgued: January 4, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[258 U.S. 13, 14]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alex. Pope Humphrey, of Louisville, Ky., Rush Taggart, of New York City, and W. Overton Harris, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Helm Bruce, of Louisville, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, herein called the Telegraph Company, brought this proceeding to condemn an easement upon the right of way of defendant in error, herein called the Railroad Company, in exercise of a right conferred by a Kentucky statute of 1898 (Ky. St.  4679c).1 \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n The purpose is to condemn as a right under the sanction of the statute so much of the right of way of the Railroad Company as was occupied at the time of suit by the Telegraph Company under a contract with the Railroad Company, which was about to expire.\n After pleadings in addition to the petition and answer, the case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict fixing the compensation and damages at $500,000. The verdict was received and entered and it was adjudged by the court that the Telegraph Company have the right it petitioned for.\n A new trial was ordered, and the court reserved to itself the decision of the necessity of the easement, and whether if adjudged, it 'would interfere with the ordinary use by' the Railroad Company 'of its right of way, or with the ordinary travel and traffic on the railroad.' Both questions were ultimately resolved in favor of the Telegraph Company and a jury having been duly impaneled, and instructed by the court, assessed the damages and compensation to be paid at five thousand dollars.\n It was then adjudged that the Telegraph Company should have the right of way prayed for. There were specific details of the manner of acquisition and use, and explicit description of the location, with provisions for changes in location according to the necessities of the Railroad Company.\n On March 8, 1916, the Telegraph Company paid into the court the amount of the award and costs.\n The Railroad Company prosecuted error to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The court after an elaborate consideration of the case said that it inferred 'from the record (the specific question has not been argued) that there are comparatively small fractions of the right of way as to which it may be reasonably claimed that the interference with the railroad use is too serious to permit condemnation.' It was intimated, however, that 'an award \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n of damages' might 'meet the case,' but that it might be that another telegraph line could not be so placed as not to substantially obstruct the use by the Railroad Company of its right of way for some railroad purpose. The court, therefore, concluded that the verdict of the jury and the judgment entered thereon must be set aside, and the case remanded for new trial upon the question of amount of compensation, and for such further hearing and decision upon the question of the forbidden interference in specific places as the opinion indicated might be open. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 249 Fed. 385, 161 C. C. A. 359. As we construe the decision there was a reversal not only on the question of damages but on the question of the interference by the easement petitioned for with the use by the railroad of its right of way. And hence there might be brought into consideration a conflict between the uses, the resolution of which would determine for or against the right of the Telegraph Company under the law of 1898\n\n\n On March 14, 1916 (Acts 1916, c. 15) the Legislature of the State repealed the Act of March 1898.2 \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n Upon the return of the case to the District Court, the Railroad Company, in an amended answer, pleaded the Act of March 14, 1916, and moved a dismissal of the petition upon the ground that that act had withdrawn the right to prosecute it. To this answer the Telegraph Company replied that the Act of March 14, 1916, did not affect the litigation, and, that if it be given that effect, it would be void under the Constitution of the State because of legislative interference with 'proceedings pending in a judicial tribunal.' And, further, that under a proper construction of the statutes of the state the present proceedings were not affected by them, and if so applied they would violate the Constitution of the State and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n The court denied the motion to dismiss the petition, deciding that the repealing act, taken in connection with Ky. St.  4653 was not intended to affect pending cases, and that if so intended it, the repealing act, was void under the Constitution of the State which precludes interference with judicial proceedings, the courts having the 'exclusive right to determine the law of existing cases.'\n The ruling was contrary to that subsequently made by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the latter court holding, reversing the District Court's action in refusing to dissolve the injunction that had been granted against the Railroad Company in a suit brought for that purpose, that within the meaning of section 465 the Telegraph Company had not acquired any vested right when the repealing act was passed and that, therefore, that act terminated the right of eminent domain conferred upon it, the Telegraph \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 18]\n\u00a0\n Company, by the law of 1898. A petition for rehearing was denied. Louisville & N. R. R. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co. (C. C. A.) 268 Fed. 4, 13.4\n The District Court, no doubt, regarding the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals as an authoritative construction of the statutes ( repealing act and section 465), on motion of the Railroad Company notwithstanding the invocation of the Constitution of Kentucky and the Constitution of the United States by the Telegraph Company, reversed its former ruling, and dismissed the petition.\n From this statement of the case it is clear that the constitutionality of the repealing act is the determining question in the case-its 'storm center' to use the words of counsel, and to the ruling of the court sustaining its constitutionality this writ of error is directed. And it was not introduced into the cause until it, the cause, was sent back for a new trial on all of the issues by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The assignments of error of the Telegraph Company are in effect repetition of its contentions in the District Court [and we may say of its contentions in the Circuit Court of Appeals] and are all based on the asserted immutability of the judgment of the District Court, the effect of the award of damages and the payment of the latter into court. The contentions repel almost immediately upon their utterance. To yield to them would practically take away the virtue of an appeal, give it right and procedure but accord it only partial effect. The present case illustrates this. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court in favor of the Telegraph Company, not only because of errors in amount of the award but because of errors in the judgment \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 19]\n\u00a0\n of conditions essential to a grant of the easement. Louisville & N. R. R. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 249 Fed. 385, 161 C. C. A. 359. There was something more, therefore, to be inquired into upon the return of the case to the District Court than the amount of compensation to be paid, as we have pointed out.\n The Telegraph Company insists that section 465 of the Kentucky statutes precludes the application of the Act of March 14, 1916, to the case, and such was the original view. We cannot accede to it. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that no right had accrued or claim arisen under the judgment of the District Court within the meaning of section 465. Besides, as also pointed out by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Act of March 14, 1916, is general and absolute. It takes away the power to condemn the right of way of a railroad company by telegraph companies and it does not save proceedings commenced before its applicable date. Such reservation is usual, if intended (Railroad Co. v. Grant, \n98 U.S. 398\n), and is illustrated by Pannell v. Louisville Tobacco Warehouse Co., 113 Ky. 630, 68 S. W. 662, 82 S. W. 1141.\n The contention that if the repealing act be construed to apply to the pending litigation it is an interference by the Legislature with judicial proceedings and, therefore, void under the Constitution of the State, challenges to particular attention. It is sustained, the company asserts, by the decisions of the state.\n The principle relied upon was first expressed in Gaines v. Gaines, Ex . & Heirs, 9 B. Mon. (Ky.) 295, 301 (48 Am. Dec. 425). We quote from a marginal note, using it as the expression of the principle of the case, as follows:\n'The Legislature have no power where a controversy is pending between individuals growing out of their respective legal rights, to so act as to cast off the rights of one of the parties and his remedy likewise. ...'\n\n It is expressed in another case as follows:\n'If the Legislature, during the pendency of litigation, were to pass an act having a retroactive effect in favor of \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 20]\n\u00a0\n one of the litigants, it would be an invasion by one independent department of the government of another, and, therefore, unconstitutional.' Marion County v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 91 Ky. 388, 15 S. W. 1061; Thweatt, etc., v. Bank of Hopkinsville, 81 Ky. 1.\n\n In another case it is succinctly said that--\n'Legislation pending suit cannot affect rights which existed before suit and upon which suit was brought.' Turner v. Town of Pewee Valley, 100 Ky. 288, 38 S. W. 143, 688.\n\n We have considered the cases and their incidents. It is not necessary to review them. There is a marked distinction between them and the case at bar. They all concerned the litigation of private rights and relations, and legislation which attempted to change those rights and relations by changing the conditions upon which they depended. The legislation in the case at bar has different purpose. It is directed to that which is conceived to concern the public interest; an exertion of power in the public interest of which the companies are the instruments or agents. It is not, therefore, within the principle of the cases cited against it. And, as we have seen, no rights had so far vested in the Telegraph Company as to preclude a change of policy or legislation which affected it.\n Of the effect of a reversal on appeal of a judgment and award in a condemnation proceeding and a repealing act, Treacy v. Elizabethtown, Lexington & Big Sandy Railroad Co., 85 Ky. 270, 3 S. W. 168, is of pertinent reference. It is there held that if a judgment in condemnation proceedings be reversed on appeal (the conditions requisite to legal condemnation of the land not having been established) the case upon reversal stands upon the petition or application alone and the proceedings being thus in fieri the law under which they were instituted could be repealed, and if repealed, the subsequent proceedings must be under the new law. The principle was announced to sustain the repeal of the charter of a railroad company under which upon the rendition of the verdict assessing damages for \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 21]\n\u00a0\n the property taken the railroad had the right to enter upon the land and construct its road, and upon payment or tender of payment was clothed with title to the property. And it was said:\n'The state has the right to say on what terms it will allow its right of eminent domain to be exercised, so long as anything remains to be done by the corporation in order to complete the condemnation of the land.'\n\n And necessarily, we may add, the state has a right to say upon what property or to what extent the right of eminent domain shall be exercised. The case seems a complete answer to the contentions of the Telegraph Company. See, also, Pannell v. Louisville Tobacco Warehouse Co., 113 Ky. 630, 68 S. W. 662, 82 S. W. 1141; Commonwealth v. Ewald Iron Co., 153 Ky. 116, 154 S. W. 931; 1 Lewis on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.)  380; Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (6th Ed.) pp. 143-343; Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes,  480-486.\n Cases in which it is decided that upon payment or tender of the award of damages the condemning company has a right to take possession of the land it seeks to condemn are not inconsistent with Treacy v. Elizabethtown, Lexington & Big Sandy Railroad Co., supra. In that case there was not only under the railroad's charter, a right of entry, but upon payment or tender of payment of the damages awarded the actual title could have been acquired and yet the repealing statute was given effect because the sonditions of condemnation had not been established.\n The same comment is applicable to section 7 of the Act of 1898, which provides that telegraph companies upon the payment of the award may enter upon the land they seek to condemn. The Telegraph Company in the present case was not put to exercise the privilege. It had possession having received it under the contract with the Railroad Company. The contract having expired the Telegraph Company was put to confirm the possession \n\n[258 U.S. 13, 22]\n\u00a0\n and fix it as a right. The accomplishment of this the repealing act prevented.\n Our conclusion, therefore, is that as the state could have withheld the power from telegraph companies to condemn the right of way of railroad companies, the state could withdraw the power before its exercise, and it could not be exercised before the conditions of condemnation were established and adjudicated, and this not preliminarily or dependently, but in final and unreviewable determination. To this situation the condemnation in the present case had not attained. The grant of power to the Telegraph Company, therefore, was subject to legislative control, and the Act of March 14, 1916, was not an 'interference by the Legislature with judicial proceedings in court' and does not offend the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 4679c. 1.

Scott & Co.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 13, 1916, the steamer Bay Port, while passing through the Cape Cod canal, ran ashore on the south bank and the next day sank diagonally across it. In January, 1917, the Canal Company filed a libel against the White Oak Transportation Company, the owner of the steamer, to recover for damages suffered by the canal and the obstruction of traffic through it. It also filed a libel against the T. A. Scott Company, Inc., a wrecking company, for negligence in dealing with the steamer after it had grounded; but this company has been exonerated and is not before us. In May, 1917, the Transportation Company filed a libel against the Canal Company, to charge it with a total loss of the steamer and freight, and in March, 1918, the Northern Coal Company intervened seeking to hold the Canal Company for a total loss of the cargo, which was coal. The causes were heard together below and were consolidated by agreement for hearing and determination upon one record here. The District Court found no negligence on either side and dismissed all the \n\n[258 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n libels. 251 Fed. 356. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the Transportation Company liable to the Canal Company, and reversed the decree in that cause. 265 Fed. 538. It also dismissed the intervening petition of the owner of the coal. 267 Fed. 176.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the owners of the Bay Port and the Canal Company both ought to have known that it was unsafe to take the vessel through the canal. We agree with the dissenting Judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals that the loss of the cargo must be attributed to the joint negligence of the two; and we are of opinion that the amount of that loss, that suffered by the vessel and that suffered by the canal should be added together and divided between the Bay Port and the Canal.\n The Bay Port was a lake-built steamer of the whaleback type, 265 feet long and of 38 feet beam, which had been brought to the Atlantic. When deeply laden she steered somewhat awkwardly but as well as other vessels of the tpye. She was loaded with 2,393 tons of coal and had a draft of 18 feet 2 inches aft and 17 feet 8 inches forward, when soon after noon on December 13, 1916, she appeared at the western or Wing's Neck entrance to the canal. Her captain was a man of experience and had gone through the canal twice with the Bay Port when empty, never when loaded. He had been solicited by the Canal Company to go by way of the canal, the Company representing the canal to be 25 feet deep throughout as its charter required. Mass. Act of 1899, c. 448,  3.\n Having got permission the Bay Port started in tow of a tug with a competent pilot. The tide was about half out, running west at about three knots an hour. After proceeding halfway through the canal the vessel passed over a shoal where there was not more than 21 or \n\n[258 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n 22 feet of water, and soon after sheered toward the north bank and then toward the south bank where she grounded, at about 1,000 feet from the shoal. It is strongly argued that this and the shoal next to be mentioned caused the trouble, but, notwithstanding The Pennsylvania, 19 Wall. 125, we will accept the finding of the two Courts that they were not the proximate cause. Two tugs and the superintendent of the canal came to the help of the Bay Port, but could not get her off as the tide was falling. The tugs kept her upon the bank and the next morning a hole was discovered in her bottom, but was plugged. Arrangements had been made to lighten the cargo when unexpectedly, about 10:15 a. m., she slid into the channel. The pilot with whom she started had left but another canal pilot who seems to have taken his place ran upon the bridge and directed the captain to start his engines at full speed to prevent her drifting upon the opposite bank. She was down at the head from 18 to 30 inches with a list to port from 15 to 24 inches. Since 6 a. m. the tide had been running to the east, the direction in which the steamer was going, and the pilot ordered a tug to take her in tow and started toward the east. The Bay Port proceeded about a mile; but after she had passed another shoal spot by some 2,000 feet, sheered again two or three times and stranded on the north bank, the bow came clear and swung down stream and then she sank and became a total loss.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that the master was responsible for the loss because he did not displace the pilot and prevent the vessel proceeding before she was fully pumped out, the cargo adjusted and slack water had come, which he might have done by holding her in the channel by the tugs that were present or by tying up to some dolphins that he passed. Upon this point we agree with the reasoning of the District Court. The emergency was serious. The canal regulations provided \n\n[258 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n that in the event of grounding the canal authorities should have the right to direct all operations for floating the vessel. The superintendent of the canal while present had told the pilot that he wanted to get the vessel out of the canal as soon as possible. The captain regarded that as the understanding of all concerned. The wreckers called out to the pilot: 'She is yours.' The pilot assumed command and started to carry out the superintendent's wish. Everybody at the time thought that the proper course, and we cannot think that the master was to blame for not overriding the judgment of the local experts, with which his own concurred, on general grounds. On the other hand, as we have said, we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals, and in any event we find that the evidence recited by it shows that the Company had notice and that the master of the vessel ought to have known that it was unsafe and improper to try to carry this vessel, loaded as it was, through the canal. Both parties, therefore, are responsible for all the damages including the loss of cargo and they should be divided between the two. The cargo owner, however, having proceeded only against the Canal Company, is entitled to a decree against that company for the full amount.

PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION(1922)\nNo. 27\nArgued: April 24, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n The Wichita Railroad & Light Company, a corporation of West Virginia, is an electric street railroad and light furnishing company doing business in Wichita, Kan., and will be known as the Wichita Company. The Kansas Gas & Electric Company, also a West Virginia corporaton, and to be known as the Kansas Company, is engaged in the business of furnishing electrical light and power to consumers in Kansas. In 1910, the two companies made a contract by which the Kansas Company agreed to furnish, and the Wichita Company agreed to accept and pay for, electrical energy at certain rates until 1930, and the contract was fulfilled by both 1918. Then the Kansas Company filed a petition with the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas, to be known as the Commission, in which it alleged that on account of the increase in the cost of production and distribution--\n'the net income of your petitioner for the year ending December 31, 1917, was approximately $190,000 less than it would and should have been if your petitioner had been able to operate under the normal conditions that existed in 1914, at which time its said rates were first installed as aforesaid; that if said rates are continued in effect hereafter, the result hereof will be disastrous to your petitioner, depriving it of a reasonable return upon the value of its said property, and making it impossible to find a market for the securities it must issue and sell in order to provide funds with which to make improvements, \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n additions and betterments which are necessary if it is to furnish proper and adequate service to the communities in which it operates.'\n\n The petition further recited that in December, 1916, being of opinion that it could reduce its rates for residential and commercial lighting, it proposed a gradual reduction and filed a schedule for the purpose, which the Commission had not acted on; that in January, 1917, it did reduce its rates, but that if a further reduction under the schedule for 1918 were made, the loss of net earnings to the petitioner would be $220,000.\n The petition continued:\n'Your petitioner is of the opinion that in order to meet this situation, and in order to increase the net earnings of your petitioner in an amount sufficient to offset the loss resulting to it from the conditions above stated, an order should be entered by the Commission, authorizing petitioner to add to its existing rates the surcharge hereinafter set out. There are approximately 19,900 consumers now served by your petitioner; the proposed surcharge does not affect consumers using 100 kilowatt hours or less per month, and therefore 17,000 of said total of 19,000 consumers are not affected. In apportioning the surcharge equitably among the remainder of said consumers, your petitioner has taken into consideration the fact that, in the generation of electrical energy for large power consumers, fuel is approximately 75 per cent. of the cost of generation, and that therefore a surcharge which has for its purpose the reimbursement of the utility company for increase in the cost of fuel should be so adjusted that the surcharge should increase in proportion to the amount of energy consumed. The percentage of increase fixed by such surcharge over existing rates is therefore increased in proportion to the amount of consumption. The last \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n step in said surcharge schedule affects 6 consumers, and the last two steps 38 consumers.\n\n'Wherefore your petitioner asks that an order be made by your honorable Commission, authorizing your petitioner to add to its existing rates for electricity in the state of Kansas, and until the further order of the Commission, the following surcharges:\n\n'For the first 100 KWH per month, no surcharge.\n\n'For the next 1,000 KWH per month, 12 mills net per KWH.\n\n'For the next 10,000 KWH per month, 9.5 mills net per KWH.\n\n'For the next 1,000 KWH per month, 8 mills net per KWH.\n\n'For all excess KWH per month 3.5 mills net per KWH.'\n\n The order of the Commission upon this petition recited that it--\n'came duly on for order by the Commission upon the pleadings of the respective parties and the evidence introduced thereunder; and the Commission upon consideration of said pleadings and evidence and being duly advised in the premises, finds that the Kansas Gas & Electric Company should be authorized and permitted to add to its existing rates for electricity supplied by it to consumers in the state of Kansas until the further order of the Commission, the following net surcharge:\n\n'For the first 100 KWH per month, no surcharge.\n\n'For the next 14,900 KWH per month, 1 mill surcharge per KWH.\n\n'For the next 20,000 KWH per month, 2 mills surcharge per KWH.\n\n'For all excess over 35,000 KWH per month, 3 mills surcharge per KWH.'\n\n The rates thus fixed were substantially higher than the contract rates.\n The Wichita Company thereupon filed a bill in equity in the United States District Court for Kansas seeking to \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n enjoin the Commission from putting the new rates in force as against it. After averring the diverse citizenship of the parties and a sufficient jurisdictional amount involved, the bill alleged that the order impaired the contract which it had with the Kansas Company, in violation of article 1, section 10, of the federal Constitution, that the rates fixed were unjust and unjustly discriminatory as against the complainant, that it was the largest customer of the Kansas Company, and that the increase of its rate as compared with that of others violated every equitable rule of rate- making, and deprived the plaintiff of its property without due process, and denied it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. A temporary injunction was issued. The answer of the Commission averred that the proceedings were regular and authorized by the statute of Kansas, that the Wichita Company had participated in them, and denied that the surcharges were discriminatory or unjust. The Kansas Company then applied for leave to intervene, and leave was granted. It answered the bill much as the Commission did, but with more elaboration, denying that the order was discriminatory or unjust, and averring that the contract of 1910 was necessarily subject to the legitimate exercise of the police power of the state, and that an order of the Commission regularly made in the exercise of that power could not be regarded as working an impairment of the obligation of the contract in the sense of the contract clause of the federal Constitution.\n The Wichita Company made a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the order of the Commission was void on its face--\n'but saved and reserved itself all of its rights in the presentation of evidence and proofs and hearing upon the merits of the issues of fact and law, otherwise than as above stated, involved in this \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n cause in the event it should be determined that final judgment and decree should not be entered pursuant to this motion.'\n\n The District Court gave judgment for the Wichita Company on the pleadings, and enjoined the Commission and the Kansas Company from putting into force the increased rates. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court and directed a dismissal of the bill; Judge Sanborn dissenting.\n The Wichita Company has appealed to this Court.\n Henry I. Green, of Urbana, Ill., and Thomas F. Doran, of Topeka, Kan., for appellant.\n H. L. McCune, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellees urged that the concession of the appellant that contracts in respect to the rates to be charged by a public utility are subject to suspension or abrogation by the police power of the state validly exercised through an administrative agency takes out of this case any federal question, because the issue then is only a state question, to wit, whether under the statute statute, the police power was validly exercised. Upon this ground they insist that the bill should have been, and must be now, dismissed for want of jurisdiction and without any inquiry into the other issues of law and fact. The original bill set out two grounds of jurisdiction, first that of diverse citizenship, and, second, that the case arose under the federal Constitution in that the order violated the contract clause of the federal Constitution, and also the Fourteenth Amendment. The intervention of the Kansas Company, a citizen \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 54]\n\u00a0\n of the same state as the Wichita Company, its opponent, did not take away the ground of diverse citizenship. That ground existed when the suit was begun and the plaintiff set it forth in the bill as a matter entitling it to go into the District Court. Jurisdiction once acquired on that ground is not divested by a subsequent change in the citizenship of the parties. Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539; Clarke v. Mathewson, 12 Pet. 164, 171; Koenigsberger v. Richmond Mining Co., \n158 \nU.S. 41, 49\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 751 39 L. Ed. 889; Louisville, etc., Ry. Co. v. Louisville Trust Co., \n174 \nU.S. 552, 566\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 817. Much less is such jurisdiction defeated by the intervention, by leave of the court, of a party whose presence is not essential to a decision of the controversy between the original parties. See equity rule 37 (33 Sup. Ct. xxviii); Adler v. Seaman (C. C. A.) 266 Fed. 828, 841; King v. Barr (C. C. A.) 262 Fed. 56, 59; Jennings v. Smith (D. C.) 242 Fed. 561, 564. The Kansas Company, while it had an interest and was a proper party, was not an indispensable party. In re Engelhard, \n231 U.S. 646\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 258.\n The jurisdiction of the District Court was not limited to federal questions presented by the bill, but extended to the entire suit and every question, whether federal or state, involved in its determination.\n The appellant assigns for error that the Circuit Court of Appeals, by directing a dismissal of the bill, refused it a hearing on the truth of the averments of the answer as to the validity of the order, and also on the issue made by the bill and answer as to whether the rates as fixed by the Commission deprived it of its property without due process of law, and denied it the equal protection of the laws. In this ruling we think there was error.\n The stress in the hearing on the motion was put on the two contentions-one, that the order of the Commission was void on its face for lack of a necessary finding that the existing contract rates were unreasonably low; and the other, that the facts averred in the petition of the \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 55]\n\u00a0\n Kansas Company to the Public Utilities Commission were not sufficient to justify such a finding if it had been made. The District Court sustained the contention; the Court of Appeals denied it. The motion for judgment being overruled, the complainant should have been accorded an opportunity, the right to which it had carefully reserved, to traverse the allegations of fact by the Kansas Company as to the basis for the order of the Commission and also to maintain by evidence and argument the issue as to due process of law and the equal protection of the law. The charge that the order made a classification denying due process and the equal protection of the law was a mixed question of law and fact, upon which the complainant had a right to be heard. Neither court passed on it. For this reason, if there was nothing else, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals would have to be reversed. Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, \n249 \nU.S. 110, 114\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 185.\n There still remain for out consideration the questions upon which the courts below differed.\n The Public Utility Law of Kansas (chapter 238 of the Session Laws of 1911) creates a commission and makes full provision for its procedure and powers. Section 13 provides that--\n'It shall be the duty of the Commission, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative, to investigate all rates, ... fares ... and if after full hearing and investigation the Commission shall find that such rates ... are unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential, the Commission shall have power to fix and order substituted therefor such rate or rates ... as shall be just and reasonable.'\n\n Section 14 and section 15 require the complaint against rates, etc., to be in writing, and a formal public hearing, of which due notice is to be given to the parties interested.\n Section 15 directs how the notice shall be given, and how long before the hearing, and its contents. \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 56]\n\u00a0\n Section 16 provides that, if upon such hearing the rates, etc., of any public utility are found to be unjust, unreasonable, unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential, the Commission shall have power to fix and substitute therefor rates, etc., 'as it shall find, determine or decree to be just, reasonable and necessary.' It rpovides that all orders and decisions of the Commission whereby any rates, etc., are altered, changed, modified, fixed or established, shall be served on the public utility affected thereby and that such public utility unless an action is commenced, in a court of proper jurisdiction to set aside 'the findings, orders and decisions' of the Commission, or to review and correct the same, shall carry the provisions of the order into effect.\n Section 20 provides that, whenever any public utility shall desire to make a change in any rate or rates, it shall file with the Commission a schedule showing the changes desired to be made and put in force by such public utility, but that no change shall be made in any rate without the consent of the Commission, and within 30 days after such changes have been authorized by the Commission copies of such schedule shall be filed in every station, office, or depot of such public utility for public inspection.\n It is said that the order in this case was authorized by section 20, and therefore that all that was needed was the filing of a schedule of changed rates and the consent of the Commission, and that no finding was required, as in sections 13 and 16. This construction of section 20 is doubtless correct, but it shows that the filing of a schedule of changed rates under that section cannot accomplish the result of abrogating contract rates. It could not do so, any more than would the original filing of a schedule of rates under section 11 requiring every public utility to publish and file with the Commission all schedules of rates do this. The consent of the Commission in section 20 is made necessary only to prevent changing schedules without notice to the Commission, \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 57]\n\u00a0\n and thus to secure a proper supervision of schedules. Such consent does not involve a hearing or a finding and a decision. The section does not, therefore, cover, or measure the essentials of, the proceeding in this case before the Commission which the order shows was upon pleadings and inter partes. We find nothing in State ex rel. Caster v. Kansas Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 96 Kan. 298, 150 Pac. 544, which gives a different construction to section 20.\n The majority opinion in the Circuit Court of Appeals in maintaining the validity of the order in this case relies on section 18 of the act, which provides that all orders, rates, etc., fixed by the Commission shall be in force 30 days thereafter, and shall be prima facie reasonable until changed by the Commission or by a court, and holds from this that it must presume that there was substantial evidence to warrant the findings. But, as we have seen, there is no finding of reasonableness or unreasonableness. Nor can we suppose that the presumption was to obtain until there was such a finding.\n The Supreme Court of Kansas, in applying the statute, recognizes that a contract for rates with a public utility cannot be abrogated, except after a finding by the Commission that they are unreasonable. This is made clear by the decision in Kaul v. American Telephone Co., 95 Kan. 1, 147 Pac. 1130. In that case, a number of customers sought to enjoin a telephone company from disconnecting their lines, because they did not pay the schedule rates published and filed with the Commission under the law of 1911 we are considering. The complainants showed an agreement by the telephone company made before the act of 1911, by which the telephone company had engaged to furnish them the service at lower than the published schedule rates on file with the Commission. The injunction was granted. The court said:\n'While that Commission is vested with broad regulatory powers, it is not shown nor claimed that it has found \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 58]\n\u00a0\n the contract rates to be unreasonable. Granting, without deciding, that the Commission has the power under the law to determine whether or not the rates prescribed by the contract are reasonable and valid, and to revise them if found to be unreasonable, it does not appear that it has exercised the power, nor that they have been presented to it for its consideration. The passage of the act did not automatically overthrow contracts, nor set aside schedules of rates which had been agreed upon. Neither did the fact that the defendant published and filed a schedule of rates with the public utilities commission abrogates the contract. In any event rates previously agreed upon between utilities and patrons will continue in force until the Commission has found them to be unreasonable, and has prescribed other rates.'\n\n The proceeding we are considering is governed by section 13. That is the general section of the act comprehensively describing the duty of the Commission, vesting it with power to fix and order substituted new rates for existing rates. The power is expressly made to depend on the condition that after full hearing and investigation the Commission shall find existing rates to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential. We conclude that a valid order of the Commission under the act must contain a finding of fact after hearing and investigation, upon which the order is founded, and that for lack of such a finding, the order in this case was void.\n This conclusion accords with the construction put upon similar statutes in other states. Public Utilities Commission v. Springfield Gas Company, 291 Ill. 209, 125 N. E. 891; Public Utilities Co. v. B. & O. S. W. R. R. Co., 281 Ill. 405, 118 N. E. 81. Moreover, it accords with general principles of constitutional government. The maxim that a legislature may not delegate legislative power has some qualifications, as in the creation of municipalities, and also in the creation of administrative \n\n[260 U.S. 48, 59]\n\u00a0\n boards to apply to the myriad details of rate schedules the regulatory police power of the state. The latter qualification is made necessary in order that the legislative power may be effectively exercised. In creating such an administrative agency, the Legislature, to prevent its being a pure delegation of legislative power, must enjoin upon it a certain course of procedure and certain rules of decision in the performance of its function. It is a wholesome and necessary principle that such an agency must pursue the procedure and rules enjoined, and show a substantial compliance therewith to give validity to its action. When, therefore, such an administrative agency is required as a condition precedent to an order, to make a finding of facts, the validity of the order must rest upon the needed finding. If it is lacking, the order is ineffective.\n It is pressed on us that the lack of an express finding may be supplied by implication and by reference to the averments of the petition invoking the action of the Commission. We cannot agree to this. It is doubtful whether the facts averred in the petition were sufficient to justify a finding that the contract rates were unreasonably low; but we do not find it necessary to answer this question. We rest our decision on the principle that an express finding of unreasonableness by the Commission was indispensable under the statutes of the state.\n We think the motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been granted. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWOOD v. U S(1922)\nNo. 100\nArgued: January 20, 1922Decided: February 27, 1922\n\n\n\n Mr. E. C. Brandenburg, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Philadelphia Steam Heating Company made a contract with the United States, approved April 5, 1897, to furnish and install the boiler plant, heating system and other apparatus for the post office building at Washington, then under construction. The price fixed was $111,373; the time for completion 250 working days; with a forfeiture of $100 a day for each day's delay. The contract provided that for each day's delay 'in the execution of the work' caused 'through any fault' of the government \n\n[258 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n one additional day was to be allowed for its completion; but 'that no claim shall be made or allowed for damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the' government. The right to make additions to or omissions from the work was reserved to the United States, allowance therefor to be determined by the supervising architect; and it was provided 'that no claim for damages on account of such changes or for anticipated profits shall be made or allowed.'\n The work was entered upon promptly both at the factory in Philadelphia and at Washington. About a month thereafter the Secretary of the Treasury requested suspension of certain work, in view of contemplated changes, and notified the contractor that he would be entitled to 'one day additional for each day's delay caused by the government, as provided for by your contract.' Radical changes in plan were made. There was a suspension for 10 months of part of the work which had to be done in the building; and later another suspension was ordered. The whole work was not completed until 18 months after the expiration of the contract period. This delay was attributable mainly, if not wholly, to the government. To recover for the expenses and loss which resulted from this delay, as well as for extra work, this suit was brought in the Court of Claims. Judgment was entered for the value of the extra work; but the court, following its decision in Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. United States, 40 Ct. Cl. 117, denied recovery for damages due to the suspension.\n The appeal to this court was taken before our decision in Wells Bros. Co. v. United States, \n254 U.S. 83\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 34. There the contract gave to the United States in terms 'the right of suspending the whole or any part of the work.' The absence of such a provision in the contract here under consideration is mainly relied upon to distinguish this case. But here, as there, the contract provided \n\n[258 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n that no claim shall be made or allowed for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States. Suspension by the government is one of several possible causes of delay-and not an uncommon one.\n Moreover, when the contractor was first directed to suspend work, he replied:\n'We are not objecting to this, but we desire to call the department's attention to the matter in order that we may be entitled to extra time should we be unable to complete the work within the time named in our contract.'\n\n So far as appears no protest was ever made against the prolonged suspension; nor was there any claim made of a right to damages arising therefrom until it was asserted in this suit.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZUCHT v. KING(1922)\nNo. 84\nArgued: October 20, 1922Decided: November 13, 1922\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Don A. Bliss, of San Antonio, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. R. L. Ball and A. W. Seeligson, both of San Antonio, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ordinances of the city of San Antonio, Texas, provide that no child or other person shall attend a public school or other place of education without having first presented a certificate of vaccination. Purporting to act under these ordinances, public officials excluded Rosalyn Zucht from a public school because she did not have the required certificate and refused to submit to vaccination. They also caused her to be excluded from a private school. Thereupon Rosalyn brought this suit against the officials in a court of the state. The bill charges that there was then no occasion for requiring vaccination; that the ordinances deprive plaintiff of her liberty without due process of law, by, in effect, making vaccination compulsory; and also that they are void, because they leave to the board of health discretion to determine when and under what circumstances the requirement shall be enforced, without providing any rule by which that board is to be guided in its action, and without providing any safeguards against partiality and oppression. The prayers were for an injunction against enforcing the ordinances, for a writ of mandamus to compel her admission to the public school, and for damages. A general demurrer to the bill of complaint was sustained by the trial court; and, plaintiff having declined to amend, the bill was dismissed. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District. 225 S. W. 267. A motion for rehearing was overruled, and an application \n\n[260 U.S. 174, 176]\n\u00a0\n for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Texas was denied by that court. A petition for a writ of certiorari filed in this court was dismissed for failure to comply with rule 37 (37 Sup. Ct. v) \n257 U.S. 650\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 53. The case is now here on writ of error granted by the Chief Justice of the Court of Civil Appeals. It is assigned as error that the ordinances violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that as administered they denied to plaintiff equal protection of the laws.\n The validity of the ordinances under the federal Constitution was drawn in question by objections properly taken below. A city ordinance is a law of the state, within the meaning of section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended (Comp. St.  1214), which provides a review by writ of error where the validity of a law is sustained by the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had. Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 555\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364. But, although the validity of a law was formally drawn in question, it is our duty to decline jurisdiction whenever it appears that the constitutional question presented is not, and was not at the time of granting the writ, substantial in character. Sugarman v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 182, 184\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 191. Long before this suit was instituted, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 11\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765, had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination. That case and others had also settled that a state may, consistently with the federal Constitution, delegate to a municipality authority to determine under what conditions health regulations shall become operative. Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, \n216 U.S. 358\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 301. And still others had settled that the municipality may vest in its officials broad discretion in matters affecting the application and enforcement of a health law. Lieberman v. Van de Carr, \n199 U.S. 552\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 144. A long line of decisions by this court had also settled \n\n[260 U.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n that in the exercise of the police power reasonable classification may be freely applied, and that regulation is not violative of the equal protection clause merely because it is not all-embracing. Adams v. Milwaukee, \n228 U.S. 572\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 610; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829. In view of these decisions we find in the record no question as to the validity of the ordinance sufficiently substantial to support the writ of error. Unlike Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 U.S. 356\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 1064, these ordinances confer not arbitrary power, but only that broad discretion required for the protection of the public health.\n The bill contains also averments to the effect that in administering the ordinance the official have discriminated against the plaintiff in such a way as to deny to her equal protection of the laws. These averments do present a substantial constitutional question. Neal v. Delaware, \n103 U.S. 370\n. But the question is not of that character which entitles a litigant to a review by this court on writ of error. The question does not go to the validity of the ordinance; nor does it go to the validity of the authority of the officials. Compare United States v. Taft, \n203 U.S. 461\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 148; Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 U.S. 445\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 329; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Clarksdale, \n257 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 27. This charge is of an unconstitutional exercise of authority under an ordinance which is valid. Compare Stadelman v. Miner, \n246 U.S. 544\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 359. Unless a case is otherwise properly here on writ of error, questions of that character can be reviewed by this court only on petition for a writ of certiorari.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n"}}
