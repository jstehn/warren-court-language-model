States Supreme Court\nALABAMA & V RY. CO. v. JOURNEY(1921)\nNo. 55\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans, La., Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., and Robert H. Thompson, of Jackson, Miss., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Robert B. Mayes, of Jackson, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 30, 1918, Smith Journey sued the Alabama & Vicksburg Railway Company in the circuit court for the second district of Hinds county, Mississippi, for an injury suffered on October 24, 1917. At the time of the accident the railroad was being operated by the company. When suit was brought the railroad was under federal control. The company pleaded in abatement that the plaintiff was not a resident of Hinds county when the alleged injury occurred, and that the alleged cause of action did not arise in the district of the county in which suit was brought. And it set up Order No. 18 of the Director General of Railroads, as amended April 18, 1918, which prohibited the institution of suits against railroads under federal control in the court for any district other than that in which the plaintiff had resided or in which the alleged cause of action arose. \n1\n A demurrer to the \n\n[257 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n plea was sustained; the plaintiff then recovered a verdict; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 122 Miss. 742, 84 South. 706. The case was brought here by writ of error. A petition for a writ of certiorari was also filed and consideration of the latter was postponed until the hearing on the writ of error. It is now granted, and the writ of error is dismissed.\n The Supreme Court of Mississippi overruled the plea in abatement on the ground that Order No. 18 exceeded the powers conferred by Congress on the President and by him on the Director General. Whether the state court erred in so holding is the only question before us. That it \n\n[257 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n did err is clear from what we said in Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593, decided since entry of the judgment under review. Section 10 of the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919 ,  3115 3\/4 j), permitted enforcement of liabilities against carriers while under federal control except 'in so far as may be inconsistent ... with any order of the President.' It was within the powers of the Director General to prescribe the venue of suits; and the facts set forth in the order show both the occasion for it and that the venue prescribed was reasonable.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n Writ of certiorari granted.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] General Order No. 18.\n April 9, 1918.\n Whereas, the Act of Congress approved March 21, 1918, entitled, 'An act to provide for the operation of transportation systems while under federal control,' provides (section 10) 'that carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws, or at common law, except in so far as may be inconsistent with the provisions of this act or with any order of the President. ...

SMITH(1921)\nNo. 166\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. E. Robertson, of Juneau, Alaska, and Harvey M. Friend, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. C. Murphy, of Anchorage, Alaska, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover the amount of taxes levied under statutes of Alaska which the plaintiff alleges to be contrary to the Act of Congress of August 24, 1912, c. 387,  3, 37 Stat. 512 (Comp. St.  3530), creating a legislative assembly in the Territory of Alaska, and to the Constitution of the United States. Judgment was given for the defendant upon demurrer to the complaint, the parties agreeing that the foregoing grounds of recovery were the only matters in dispute. The statutes attacked, viz.: May 1, 1913 (Laws 1913, c. 52), April 29, 1915 ( Laws 1915, c. 76), and May 3, 1917 (Laws 1917, c. 74), levy license taxes of two dollars a barrel and two dollars a ton respectively, upon persons manufacturing fish oil, fertilizer and fish meal in whole or in part from herring. The Act of Congress after giving effect to the Constitution and laws of the United States in the Territory provides that the authority therein granted to the legislature 'to alter, amend, modify, and repeal laws in force in Alaska shall not extend to the ... fish ... laws ... of the United States applicable to Alaska, or to the laws of the United States providing for taxes on business and trade. ... Provided, further, that this provision shall not operate to prevent the legislature from imposing other and additional taxes or licenses.' Some reliance is placed also upon section 9 (section 3536) that all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, &c., and that no tax shall be levied for territorial \n\n[255 U.S. 44, 48]\n\u00a0\n purposes in excess of one per centum upon the assessed valuation of property therein in any one year.\n The complaint alleges that the tax will prohibit and confiscate the plaintiff's business, which is that of manufacturing fish oil, fertilizer, fish meal and by-products from herring either in whole or in part; that the tax unreasonably discriminates against the plaintiff, as it levies no tax upon the producers of fish oil, &c., from other fish, and is otherwise extortionate; and that it contravenes the Act of Congress in lack of uniformity and in exceeding one per centum of the actual value of the plaintiff's property. The prophecies of destruction and the allegations of discrimination as compared with similar manufactures from salmon are denied by the Attorney General for Alaska, the latter denial being based upon a comparison of the statutes which of course is open. We are content however to assume for the purposes of decision that, not to speak of other licenses, the questioned Acts do bear more heavily upon the use of herring for oil and fertilizer than they do upon the use of other fish. But there is nothing in the Constitution to hinder that. If Alaska deems it for its welfare to discourage the destruction of herring for manure and to preserve them for food for man or for salmon, and to that end imposes a greater tax upon that part of the plaintiff's industry than upon similar use of other fish or of the offal of salmon, it hardly can be said to be contravening a Constitution that has known protective tariffs for a hundred years. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455. Even if the tax should destroy a business it would not be made invalid or require compensation upon that ground alone. Those who enter upon a business take that risk. McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561. See Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 U.S. 59\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 192; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 U.S. 623\n, 8 Sup.

We need not consider whether abuses of the power might go to \n\n[255 U.S. 44, 49]\n\u00a0\n such a point as to transcend it, for we have not such a case before us. The Acts must be judged by their contents not by the allegations as to their purpose in the complaint. We know of no objection to exacting a discouraging rate as the alternative to giving up a business, when the legislature has the full power of taxation. The case is different from those where the power to tax is limited to inspection fees and the like, as in Postal Telegraph & Cable Co. v. Taylor, \n192 \nU.S. 64, 72\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 208.\n But it is said that however it may be with regard to the Constitution taken by itself, the statutes brought into question are contrary to the act of Congress from which the local legislature derives its power. In the first place they are said to be an attempt to modify or repeal the fish laws of the United States. The Act of Congress of June 6, 1900, c. 786,  29; 31 Stat. 321, 331; Alaska Compiled Laws,  2569; imposes a tax on fish oil works of ten cents per barrel and on fertilizer works of twenty cents per ton, repeated in slightly different words by the Act of June 26, 1906, c. 3547; 34 Stat. 478 (Comp. St.  3628); Alaska Compiled Laws,  259. But these are not fish laws as we understand the phrase. It is argued, however, that at least they import a license, License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 470, and that a tax alleged to be prohibitory flies in their teeth. It would be going far to say that a tax on fish oil works in general terms imported a license to a specific kind of works deemed undesirable by the local powers, and when we take into account the express and unlimited authority to impose additional taxes and licenses we are satisfied that the objection should not prevail. We confine our decision to the statutes before us, repeating in this connection that they must be judged by their contents not by the characterization of them in the complaint.\n The requirement of uniformity in section 9 is disposed of by what we have said of the classification when considered with reference to the Constitution. The legislature was \n\n[255 U.S. 44, 50]\n\u00a0\n warranted in treating the making of oil and fertilizer from herring as a different class of subjects from the making of the same from salmon offal. The provisions against taxing in excess of one per centum of the assessed valuation of property does not apply to a license tax like this. This is not a property tax. Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Territory of Alaska, 236 Fed. 52, 61, 149 C. C. A. 262. The objection that the plaintiff in error is doubly taxed, first by the United States and then by the Territory, is answered by the express authority to levy additional taxes to which we have referred heretofore. Without going into more detail we are of opinion that the tax must be sustained.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN BANK & TRUST CO. v. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA(1921)\nNo. 679\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alexander W. Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n Messrs. Hollins N. Randolph and Robert S. Parker, both of Atlanta, Ga ., for appellees.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by country banks incorporated by the State of Georgia against the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, incorporated under the laws of the United States, and its officers. It was brought in a State Court but removed to the District Court of the United States on the petition of the defendants. A motion to remand was made by the plaintiffs but was overruled. The allegations of the bill may be summed up in comparatively few words. The plaintiffs are not members of the Federal Reserve System and many of them have too small a capital to permit their joining it-a capital that could not be increased to the required amount in the thinly populated sections of the country where they operate. An important part of the income of these small institutions is a charge for the services rendered by them in paying checks drawn upon them at a distance and forwarded, generally by other banks, through the mail. The charge covers the expense incurred by the paying bank and a small profit. The banks in the Federal Reserve System are forbidden to make such charges to other banks in the System. Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913, c. 6,  13; 38 Stat. 263; amended March 3, 1915, c. 93; 38 Stat. 958; September 7, 1916, c. 461; 39 Stat. 752; and June 21, 1917, c. 32,  4, 5; 40 Stat. 234, 235 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9796). It is alleged that in pursuance of a policy accepted by the Federal Reserve Board the defendant bank has determined to use its power to compel the plaintiffs and others in like situation to become members of \n\n[256 U.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n the defendant, or at least to open a nonmember clearing account with defendant, and thereby under the defendant's requirements, to make it necessary for the plaintiffs to maintain a much larger reserve than in their present condition they need. This diminution of their lending power coupled with the loss of the profit caused by the above mentioned clearing of bank checks and drafts at par will drive some of the plaintiffs out of business and diminish the income of all. To accomplish the defendants' wish they intend to accumulate checks upon the country banks until they reach a large amount and then to cause them to be presented for payment over the counter or by other devices detailed to require payment in cash in such wise as to compel the plaintiffs to maintain so much cash in their vaults as to drive them out of business or force them, if able, to submit to the defendant's scheme. It is alleged that the proposed conduct will deprive the plaintiffs or their property without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution and that it is ultra vires. The bill seeks an injunction against the defendants collecting checks except in the usual way. The District Court dismissed the bill for want of equity and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals ( November 19, 1920). The plaintiffs appealed, setting up want of jurisdiction in the District Court and error in the final decree.\n We agree with the Court below that he removal was proper. The principal dependant was incorporated under the laws of the United States and that has been established as a ground of jurisdiction since Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738; Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 U.S. 1\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1113; Matter of Dunn, \n212 U.S. 374\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 299. We shall say but a word in answer to the appellants' argument that a suit against such a corporation is not a suit arising under those laws within section 24 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087 (Comp. St.  991). The contrary is \n\n[256 U.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n established, and the accepted doctrine is intelligible at least since it is part of the plaintiffs' case that the defendant bank existed and exists as an entity capable of committing the wrong alleged and of being sued. These facts depend upon the laws of the United States. Bankers' Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n241 \nU.S. 295, 306\n, 307 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 569; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cody, \n166 U.S. 606\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 703. See further Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 U.S. 180\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 243, February 28, 1921. A more plausible objection is that by the Judicial Code,  24, sixteenth, except as therein excepted national banking associations for the purposes of suits against them are to be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located. But we agree with the Court below that the reasons for localizing ordinary commercial banks do not apply to the Federal Reserve Banks created after the Judicial Code was enacted and that the phrase 'national banking associations' does not reach forward and include them. That phrase is used to describe the ordinary commercial banks whereas the others are systematically called 'Federal Reserve Banks'. We see no sufficient ground for supposing that Congress meant to open the questions that the other construction would raise.\n On the merits we are of opinion that the Courts below went too far. The question at this stage is not what the plaintiffs may be able to prove, or what may be the reasonable interpretation of the defendants' acts, but whether the plaintiffs have shown a ground for relief if they can prove what they allege. We lay on one side as not necessary to our decision the question of the defendants' powers, and assuming that they act within them consider only whether the use that according to the bill they intend to make of them will infringe the plaintiffs' rights. The defendants say that the holder of a check has a right to present it to the bank upon which it was drawn for payment over the counter, and that however many checks \n\n[256 U.S. 350, 358]\n\u00a0\n he may hold he has the same right as to all of them and may present them all at once, whatever his motive or intent. They ask whether a mortgagee would be prevented from foreclosing because he acted from disinterested malevolence and not from a desire to get his money. But the word 'right' is one of the most deceptive of pitfalls; it is so easy to slip from a qualified meaning in the premise to an unqualified one in the conclusion. Most rights are qualified. A man has at least as absolute a right to give his own money as he has to demand money from a party that has made no promise to him; yet if he gives it to induce another to steal or murder the purpose of the act makes it a crime.\n A bank that receives deposits to be drawn upon by check of course authorizes its depositors to draw checks against their accounts and holders of such checks to present them for payment. When we think of the ordinary case the right of the holder is so unimpeded that it seems to us absolute. But looked at from either side it cannot be so. The interests of business also are recognized as rights, protected against injury to a greater or less extent, and in case of conflict between the claims of business on the one side and of third persons on the other lines have to be drawn that limit both. A man has a right to give advice but advice given for the sole purpose of injuring another's business and effective on a large scale, might create a cause of action. Banks as we know them could not exist if they could not rely upon averages and lend a large part of the money that they receive from their depositors on the assumption that not more than a certain fraction of it will be demanded on any one day. If without a word of falsehood but acting from what we have called disinterested malevolence a man by persuasion should organize and carry into effect a run upon a bank and ruin it, we cannot doubt that an action would lie. A similar result even if less complete in its effect is to be \n\n[256 U.S. 350, 359]\n\u00a0\n expected from the course that the defendants are alleged to intend, and to determine whether they are authorized to follow that course it is not enough to refer to the general right of a holder of checks to present them but it is necessary to consider whether the collection of checks and presenting them in a body for the purpose of breaking down the petitioner's business as now conducted is justified by the ulterior purpose in view.\n If this were a case of competition in private business it would be hard to admit the justification of self interest considering the now current opinion as to public policy expressed in statutes and decisions. But this is not a private business. The policy of the Federal Reserve Banks is governed by the policy of the United States with regard to them and to these relatively feeble competitors. We do not need aid from the debates upon the statute under which the Reserve Banks exist to assume that the United States did not intend by that statute to sanction this sort of warfare upon legitimate creations of the States.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN COLUMN & LUMBER CO. v. U.S.(1921)\nNo. 71\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Louis Claire Boyle and G. Carroll Todd, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Solicitor General James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C., and James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for the United States.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 377, 391]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Willam J. Matthews and Mr. Hugh T. Martin, by leave of court, filed a brief as amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The unincorporated 'American Hardwood Manufacturers' Association' was formed in December, 1918, by the consolidation of two similar associations, from one of which it took over a department of activity designated the 'Open Competition Plan,' and hereinafter referred to as the 'Plan.'\n Participation in the Plan was optional with the members of the Association, but, at the time this suit was commenced, of its 400 members, 365, operating 465 mills, were members of the Plan. The importance and strength of the Association is shown by the admission in the joint answer that, while the defendants operated only 5 per cent. of the number of mills engaged in hardwood manufacture in the country, they produced one- third of the total production of the United States. The places of business of the corporations and partnerships members of the Plan were located in many states from New York to Texas, but chiefly in the hardwood producing territory of the Soughwest. The defendants are the members of the Plan, their personal representatives, and F. R. Gadd, its 'Manager of Statistics.'\n The bill alleged, in substance, that the Plan constituted a combination and conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce in hardwood lumber by restricting competition and maintaining and increasing prices, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 209 [Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830]). \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 392]\n\u00a0\n The answer denied that the Plan had any such purpose and effect as charged, and averred that it promoted competition, especially among its own members.\n A temporary injunction, granted by the District Court, restricting the activities of the Plan in specified respects, by consent of the parties, was made permanent, and a direct appeal brings the case here for review.\n The activities which we shall see were comprehended within the 'Open Competition Plan' (which is sometimes called the 'New Competition') have come to be widely adopted in our country, and, as this is the first time their legality has been before this court for decision, some detail of statement with respect to them is necessary.\n There is very little dispute as to the facts. The testimony of the government consists of various documents and excerpts from others, obtained from the files of the Plan, and the testimony of the defendants consists of like documents and excerpts from other documents, also from the same files, supplemented by affidavits of a number of persons, members and nonmembers, chiefly to the point that the confessedly great increases of prices during 1919 were dut to natural trade and weather conditions and not to the influence of the Plan.\n The record shows that the Plan was evolved by a committee, which, in recommending its adoption, said:\n'The purpose of the plan is to disseminate among members accurate knowledge of production and market conditions so that each member may gauge the market intelligently instead of guessing at it; to make competition open and above board instead of secret and concealed; to substitute, in estimating market conditions, frank and full statements of out competitors for the frequently misleading and colored statements of the buyer.'\n\n After stating that the purpose was not to restrict competition or to control prices but to 'furnish information to enable each member to intelligently make prices and to \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 393]\n\u00a0\n intelligently govern his production,' the committee continues:\n'The chief concern of the buyer, as we all know, is to see that the price he pays is no higher than that of his competitors, against whom he must sell his product in the market. The chief concern of the seller is to get as much as anybody else for his lumber; in other words to get what is termed the top of the market for the quality he offers. By making prices known to each other they will gradually tend toward a standard in harmony with market conditions, a situation advantageous to both buyer and seller.'\n\n Not long after the consolidation, a further explanation of the objects and purposes of the Plan was made in an appeal to members to join it, in which it is said:\n'The theoretical proposition at the basis of the Open Competition Plan is that\n\n'Knowledge regarding prices actually made is all that is necessary to keep prices at reasonably stable and normal levels.\n\n'The Open Competition Plan is a central clearing house for information on prices, trade statistics and practices. By keeping all members fully and quickly informed of what the others have done, the work of the Plan results in a certain uniformity of trade practice. There is no agreement to follow the practice of others, although members do follow their most intelligent competitors, if they know what these competitors have been actually doing.\n\n'The monthly meetings held in various sections of the country each month have improved the human relations existing between the members before the organization of this Plan.'\n\n And in another later and somewhat similar, appeal sent to all the members, this is found:\n'Competition, blind, vicious, unreasoning, may stimulate trade to abnormal activity, but such condition is no \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 394]\n\u00a0\n more sound than that medieval spirit some still cling to of taking a club and going out and knocking the other fellow and taking away his bone.\n\n'The keynote to modern business success is mutual confidence and co- operation. Co-operative competition, not cutthroat competition. Co- operation is a matter of business, because it pays, because it enables you to get the best price for your product, because you come into closer personal contact with the market.\n\n'Co-operation will only replace undesirable competition as you develop a co-operative spirit. For the first time in the history of the industry, the hardwood manufacturers are organized into one compact, comprehensive body, equipped to serve the whole trade in a thorough and efficient manner. ... More members mean more power to do more good for the industry. With co-operation of this kind we will very soon have enlisted in our efforts practically every producing interest, and you know what that means.'\n\n Thus, the Plan proposed a system of cooperation among the members, consisting of the interchange of reports of sales, prices, production, and practices, and in meetings of the members for discussion, for the avowed purpose of substituting 'co-operative competition' for cutthroat competition,' of keeping 'prices at reasonably stable and normal levels,' and of improving the 'human relations' among the members. But the purpose to agree upon prices or production was always disclaimed.\n Coming, now, to the fully worked out paper plan as adopted:\n It required each member to make six reports to the secretary, viz.:\n\n 1. \nA daily report of all sales actually made, with the name and address of the purchaser, the kind, grade and quality of lumber sold and all special agreements of every \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 395]\n\u00a0\n kind, verbal or written with respect thereto. 'The reports to be exact copies of orders taken.'\n\n 2. \nA daily shipping report, with exact copies of the invoices, all special agreements as to terms, grade, etc. The classification shall be the same as with sales.\n\n 3. \nA monthly production report, showing the production of the member reporting during the previous month, with the grades and thickness classified as prescribed in the Plan.\n\n 4. \nA monthly stock report by each member, showing the stock on hand on the first day of the month, sold and unsold, green and dry, with the total of each, kind, grade and thickness.\n\n 5. \nPrice-lists. Members must file at the beginning of each month price-lists showing prices f. o. b. shipping point, which shall be stated. New prices must be filed with the association as soon as made.\n\n 6. \nInspection reports. These reports are to be made to the association by a service of its own, established for the purpose of checking up grades of the various members and the Plan provides for a chief inspector and sufficient assistants to inspect the stocks of all members from time to time.\n The declared purpose of the inspection service is not to change any member's grading except with his consent, but to furnish each member a basis on which he can compare his prices with those of other members, thereby making all members' reports more intelligible and accurate.\n All of these reports by members are subject to complete audit by representatives of the association. Any member who fails to report shall not receive the reports of the secretary, and failure to report for twelve days in six months shall cause the member failing to be dropped from membership.\n Plainly it would be very difficult to devise a more minute disclosure of everything connected with one's \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 396]\n\u00a0\n business than is here provided for by this Plan, and very certainly only the most attractive prospect could induce any man to make it to his rivals and competitors.\n But, since such voluminous disclosures to the secretary would be valueless, unless communicated to the members in a condensed and interpreted form, provision is made for this, as follows:\n The secretary is required to send to each member:\n\n 1. \nA monthly summary showing the production of each member for the previous month, 'subdivided as to grade, kind, thickness,' etc.\n\n 2. \nA weekly report, not later than Saturday, of all sales, to and including the preceding Tuesday, giving each sale and the price, and the name of the purchaser.\n\n 3. \nOn Tuesday of each week the secretary must send to each member a report of each shipment by each member, complete up to the evening of the preceding Thursday.\n\n 4. \nHe must send a monthly report, showing the individual stock on hand of each member and a summary of all stock, green and dry, sold and unsold. This report is very aptly referred to by the managing statistician as a monthly inventory of the stock of each member.\n\n 5. \nNot later than the 10th of each month the secretary shall send a summary of the pricelists furnished by members, showing the prices asked by each, and any changes made therein must be immediately transmitted to all the members.\n\n 6. \nA market report letter shall be sent to each member of the association (whether participating in the plan or not) pointing 'out changes in conditions both in the producing and consuming sections, giving a comparison of production and sales and in general an analysis of the market conditions.'\n\n 7. \nMeetings shall be held once a month at Cincinnati 'or at points to be agreed upon by the members.' 'It is intended that the regular meetings shall afford oppor tunity \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 397]\n\u00a0\n for the discussion of all subjects of interest to the members.'\n'The plan also requires the selection of a man to take charge of the gathering and dissemination of data, with necessary assistants,' and the defendant F. R. Gadd was selected and given the title of 'Manager of Statistics.'\n\n This extensive interchange of reports, supplemented as it was by monthly meetings at which an opportunity was afforded for discussion 'of all subjects of interest to the members,' very certainly constituted an organization through which agreements, actual or implied, could readily be arrived at and maintained, if the members desired to make them.\n Such, in outline, was the paper plan adopted by the association, but, elaborate though it was, in practice three important additions were made to it.\n First of all, the Southwestern territory for meeting purposes was divided into four districts, and instead of the monthly meeting provided for in the Plan, 'in order that members could more conveniently attend,' the record shows that 49 of these meetings were held between January 31, 1919, and February 19, 1920-approximately one for each week, in some part of the territory.\n Second. Before each of these meetings a questionnaire was sent out to the members, and from the replies received, supplementing the other reports, the statistician compiled an estimate of the condition of the market, actual and prospective, which was distributed to the members attending each meeting, and was mailed to those not present. There were 11 questions on this list, of which the most important were:\n'(4) What was your total production of hardwood during the last month? What do you estimate your production will probably be for the next two months?' \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 398]\n\u00a0\n '(10) Do you expect to shut down within the next few months on account of shortage of logs or for any other reason? If so, please state how long you will be idle.\n\n'(11) What is your view of market conditions for the next few months and what is the general outlook for business? State the reasons for your conclusion.'\n\n The Plan on paper provided only for reports of past transactions and much is made of this in the record and in argument-that reporting to one another past transactions cannot fix prices for the future. But each of these three questions plainly invited an estimate and discussion of future market conditions by each member, and a co-ordination of them by an expert analyst could readily evolve an attractive basis for cooperative, even if unexpressed, 'harmony' with respect to future prices.\n Third. The Plan provided for a monthly 'market report letter' to go to all members of the association. In practice this market report letter was prepared by F. R. Gadd, manager of statistics, but his review of the market and forecast for the future were contained, almost from the beginning, not only in these market letters but also in the weekly sales reports, so that they were sent out to all of the members 19 times between February 1 and December 6, 1919, and they were discussed at all but one or two of the 49 meetings which were held. All the activities of the Plan plainly culminated in the counsels contained in these letters and reports.\n This elaborate plan for the interchange of reports does not simply supply to each member the amount of stock held, the sales made and the prices received, by every other member of the group, thereby furnishing the data for judging the market, on the basis of supply and demand and current prices. It goes much farther. It not only furnishes such information, with respect to stock, sales and prices, but also reports, giving the views of \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 399]\n\u00a0\n each member as to 'market conditions for the next few months'; what the production of each will be for the next 'two months'; frequent analyses of the reports by an expert, with, we shall see, significant suggestions as to both future prices and production; and opportunities for future meetings for the interchange of views, which the record shows were very important. It is plain that the only element lacking in this scheme to make it a familiar type of the competition suppressing organization is a definite agreement as to production and prices. But this is supplied: By the disposition of men 'to follow their most intelligent competitors,' especially when powerful; by the inherent disposition to make all the money possible, joined with the steady cultivation of the value of 'harmony' of action; and by the system of reports, which makes the discovery of price reductions inevitable and immediate. The sanctions of the plan obviously are financial interest, intimate personal contact, and business honor, all operating under the restraint of exposure of what would be deemed bad faith and of trade punishment by powerful rivals.\n The principles of law by which we must judge of the legality of the scheme of doing business thus provided for, as it was worked out in practice, are clearly settled by the antitrust statute and the decisions of this court interpreting it.\n The applicable provision of the act (26 Stat. 209, c. 647) reads:\n'Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states ... is hereby declared to be illegal.'\n\n Obviously the organization of the defendants constitutes a combination and confessedly they are engaged in a large way in the transportation and sale of lumber in interstate commerce so that there remains for decision \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 400]\n\u00a0\n only the question whether the system of doing business adopted resulted in that direct and undue restraint of interstate commerce which is condemned by this anti-trust statute.\n It has been repeatedly held by this court that the purpose of the statute is to maintain free competition in interstate commerce and that any concerted action by any combination of men or corporations to cause, or which in fact does cause, direct and undue restraint of competition in such commerce, falls within the condemnation of the act and is unlawful.\n In Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 337\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 436, 457 (48 L. Ed. 679), it is declared that:\n'In all the prior cases in this court the AntiTrust Act has been construed as forbidding any combination which by its necessary operation destroys or restricts free competition among those engaged in interstate commerce; in other words that to destroy or restrict free competition in interstate commerce was to restrain such commerce.'\n\n In United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61, 87\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 53, 58 (57 L. Ed. 124), decided in 1912, long prior to the forming of their combination by the defendants, the law was condensed into this expression:\n'To preserve from undue restraint the free action of competition in interstate commerce was the purpose which controlled Congress in enacting this statute, and the courts should construe the law with a view to effecting the object of its enactment.'\n\n And in Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 609\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 951, 953 (58 L. Ed. 1490, L. R. A. 1915A, 788), it was said:\n'It [the Sherman Act] broadly condemns all combinations and conspiracies which restrain the free and natural flow of trade in the channels of interstate commerce.'\n\n And again, on page 613 of 234 U. S., on page 954 of 34 Sup. Ct. (58 L. Ed. 1490, L. R. A. 1915A, 788):\n'The argument that the course pursued is necessary to the protection of the retail trade and promotive of the \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 401]\n\u00a0\n public welfare in providing retail facilities is answered by the fact that Congress, with the right to control the field of interstate commerce, has so legislated as to prevent resort to practices which unduly restrain competition or unduly obstruct the free flow of such commerce, and private choice of means must yield to the national authority thus exerted.'\n\n With this rule of law and the details of the Plan in mind, we come to consider what the record shows as to the purpose of this combination and as to its effect upon interstate commerce.\n We have seen that the Plan provided for the selection of a man to have charge of the gathering and dissemination of the data, which were to be contained in the various reports, and that the defendant F. R. Gadd was selected for this purpose, with the title of 'Manager of Statistics.' Mr. Gadd was a man of large experience in the lumber business, competent and aggressive, and the record makes it clear that he was in complete and responsible charge of all the activities of this Open Competition Plan. He compiled the summaries of daily, weekly, and monthly reports, and wrote the monthly market letter and the market comment in the weekly sales reports, which were distributed to the members. Some disposition appears in the argument, but not in the evidence, to suggest that Gadd exceeded his authority at times, but no objection appears to have been taken to any of his conduct, and the 'Secretary-Manager' says in his affidavit that his office adjoins that of Gadd and that 'he (Gadd) and affiant have frequent conferences and discussions relating to their work, and that affiant is familiar with the activities and method of the Open Competition Plan.'\n In is plain that as the Plan was the 'clearing house' of the members, 'for information on prices, trade statistics, and practices,' so Gadd was the 'clearing \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 402]\n\u00a0\n house' of the Plan, and that what he said and did, acquiesced in by the members, as it was, must be accepted as the authoritative expression of the combination.\n The record shows that the lumber market was inactive in the months of January and February and the first part of March of 1919. It grew better late in March, and progressively stronger until in July, when it became very active, with prices high, and so continued until the end of the year we are considering.\n In the first quarter of the year the problem was to maintain the war prices then prevailing rather than to advance them, and although the minutes of the various meetings were kept in barest outline, we find that, beginning within a month of the consolidation of the two associations, the members of the Plan began actively to co-operate through the meetings, to suppress competition by restricting production. This is very clearly shown by the excerpts following from the minutes of meetings and from the market letters and sales reports distributed at them.\n Thus, at the meeting held at Cincinnati, on January 21, 1919, in the discussion of business conditions, the chairman said:\n'If there is no increase in production, particularly in oak, there is going to be good business. ... No man is safe in increasing production. If he does, he will be in bad shape, as the demand won't come.'\n\n Again, at the meeting held on May 9th, at Memphis, in the discussion of market conditions, appears this paragraph:\n'Reference was made to members who contemplate running day and night, and it was stated that the lumber industry had seen these unusual market conditions before and that we ought to be very sure that the market is capable of taking care of night and day lumber.' \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 403]\n\u00a0\n This warning of May 9th against producing too much lumber was followed, on May 17th, by a sales report sent out by the Manager of Statistics to all members, which was headed, 'Stop. Look and Listen.' After saying that the hardwood market had assumed a decidedly better tone, with a tendency in quotations upward, with the demend on the increase and with stocks below normal, the writer continues:\n\n'The lumbermen have gone through several lean years, but we are confronted with the possibility of killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Overproduction will spell disaster, as it should always be borne in mind that the maximum productive capacity of the sawmills of the country is much in excess of any demand the country has ever known.'\n\n He then quotes from an editorial in the Southern Lumberman, in which, among other things, it is said:\n'The danger which we see lurking in the future for the lumber industry is overproduction. When the demand for lumber is good and the prices are good, it is a strong temptation to the sawmill men to put night shifts at the mill and an extra logging crew in the woods and keep turning out lumber 24 hours in the day. The desire to cash in while the cashing is good is natural and easy to understand, but every sawmill man who contemplates putting on a night shift should stop long enough to reflect on the past history of the lumber business. If he does indulge in such reflection the chances are he will give up any ideas he may have along that line. Overproduction has always been the curse of the lumber industry in America. It has caused more trouble and hardship than any other one factor. It would be criminal folly therefore for the lumber manufacturers to indulge themselves in any such form of commercial suicide.' \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 404]\n\u00a0\n Adding that the lumbermen have within their grasp an era of prosperity for some time to come, the writer continues:\n\n'They can either reach forward to seize their opportunity or they can cast it aside by the policy of overproduction. Which shall it be? It is up to the sawmill men themselves to decide.'\n\n The managing statistician of the association significantly adds:\n'Are we guilty? If so, the warning is timely.'\n\n Again, a week later, at a meeting at Shreveport, Louisiana, in the discussion of market conditions, one of the members declared that in his opinion it was 'suicidal to run a mill night and day; that the pine mills had done it, but he hoped that (we) would profit by their past experience and not do it this year.'\n Much more of like purport appears in the minutes of the meetings throughout the year, but this is sufficient to convincingly show that one of the prime purposes of the meetings, held in every part of the lumber district, and of the various reports, was to induce members to co-operate in restricting production, thereby keeping the supply low and the prices high, and that whenever there was any suggestion of running the mills to an extent which would bring up the supply to a point which might affect prices, the advice against operations which might lead to such result was put in the strongest possible terms. The co-operation is palpable and avowed, its purpose is clear, and we shall see that it was completely realized.\n Next, the record shows clearly that the members of the combination were not satisfied to secure, each for himself, the price which might be obtainable even as the result of co-operative restriction of production, but that throughout the year they assiduously cultivated, through the letters of Gadd, speaking for them all, and through the \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 405]\n\u00a0\n discussions at the meetings, the general conviction that higher and higher price were obtainable and a disposition on the part of all to demand them. The intention to create such a common purpose is too clear to be doubted, evidenced as it is by the following excerpts from much of like character in the testimony:\n As thus, in the stock report of March 8, 1919, after pointing out that the stock at the mills was only about three-fourths normal and that the production in the Memphis group of manufacturers was only 56 per cent. of normal, the letter of the Manager of Statistics continues:\n'There has been a long drawn out and desperate effort to break the hardwood market by withdrawal of demand; but, be it said to the eternal credit of the hardwood producers, they have maintained a stout heart and stiff backbone, with the result that there has been exhibited a strength in the market which has been little short of remarkable in the face of the light demand and the vigorous efforts which have been steadily made to hammer down prices. ...\n\n'With this known information before him it is difficult to see how any intelligent hardwood manufacturer can entertain any hesitation as to the proper course for him to pursue in selling his lumber.'\n\n And it may be added that it is not difficult to see what this 'proper course to pursue' was intended to be.\n Again, three weeks later, in the market letter of March 29th, after stating that stocks had further decreased from the previous month, with a production not to exceed 50 per cent. of normal, the Manager of Statistics of the Plan adds:\n'Naturally the situation ought to have an important bearing on the plans of every hardwood lumberman. If the facts were better understood, offers of business now at shaded prices would get scant consideration and there \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 406]\n\u00a0\n would not only be no good reason to cut prices, but there would be every reason why they should be held at reasonable profit making levels. ... All conditions indicate a firm market for the balance of the year, with prices moving upward.'\n\n Another month later, in the market letter of April 26th, this influential agent of the association, after pointing out that stocks were less than 75 per cent. of normal, that production was about 60 per cent. of normal and that the demand was far in excess of the supply, adds:\n'If ever there was a time when rich rewards awaited the producer of hardwood lumber, now is that time. There are glorious opportunities ahead. ... Supply and demand must necessarily govern prices. The demand is with us, the supply inadequate, therefore values must increase, as our competition in hardwood is only among ourselves.'\n\n Again, in another month, May 24th, in his sales report, the Manager of Statistics, after stating that production during the month of April was 65 per cent. of normal and that a careful estimate indicated that there would be no material increase in May and June, says:\n'If any one tells you that lumber prices are coming down, call their attention to the following: Curtailed production of mills; stocks below normal; necessity on the part of lumber operators of obtaining a price level that will enable them to make a reasonable profit.'\n\n And he concludes with:\n'The tendency of the market is upward, and will undoubtedly continue to advance so long as sales and production bear their present relation to each other.'\n\n Again on September 20th, in his market letter, he says:\n'It has been rumored that a certain class of buyers, believing that the price of lumber was too high, and that the \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 407]\n\u00a0\n temporary inactivity in the export market offered the opportune moment, have agreed to confine purchases to actual immediate requirements during the next 60 days. This is not going to worry the manufacturers very much; in fact, it will give them a much needed breathing spell and an opportunity to accumulate a supply of dry stocks which, in our opinion, is the same as gold dollars in the bank.'\n\n ...\n'Those who have been looking for lower prices overlook the very important factors: That production continues below normal; ... that unsold stocks at mills are seventy per cent below normal; that the export demand has just started. ...'\n\n And he concludes:\n'With these conditions prevailing there is nothing in the situation that should encourage any one to hope for a drop in quotations.'\n\n To this we must add that constantly throughout the minutes of the various meetings there is shown discussion of the stock and production reports in which the shortage of supply was continually emphasized, with the implication, not disguised, that higher prices must result. Men in general are so easily persuaded to do that which will obviously prove profitable that this reiterated opinion from the analyst of their association, with all obtainable data before him, that higher prices were justified and could easily be obtained, must, inevitably have resulted, as it did result, in concert of action in demanding them.\n But not only does the record thus show a persistent purpose to encourage members to unite in pressing for higher and higher prices, without regard to cost, but there are many admissions by members, not only that this was the purpose of the Plan, but that it was fully realized.\n Within four months of the consolidation, on April 23, 1919, the Manager of Statistics wrote to members asking \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 408]\n\u00a0\n each to write him 'his experience with the Plan' and any incidents showing benefits derived from it.\n The replies to this letter are significant confessions. One writes:\n'All who have access to your reports bring their prices to the top.'\n\n Another:\n'There seems to be a friendly rivalry among members to see who can get the best prices; whereas, under the old plan, it was cutthroat competition.'\n\n Another:\n'It has kept us in touch closely with the market and in many instances has made us one or more dollars per thousand feet on the lumber sold, and we believe the plan in going to be very successful in carrying out the purposes for which it was intended.'\n\n Another:\n'From the first report we received under this plan we were enabled to increase our price $6 per thousand on a special item of oak. We had just taken a small order at what we thought a satisfactory price, but discovered immediately that others were getting more money. Since then we have booked orders for a number of these special items at the increase of $6 per thousand.'\n\n Another:\n'Since we became members we have been selling our lumber at several dollars per M more than formerly, and we are perfectly satisfied with the plan.'\n\n And another:\n'We have always left these meetings feeling that we did not get money enough for our lumber and that we ought to try to do better.'\n\n There was one discordant reply, saying:\n'The Open Competition Plan has been absolutely accurate, but, instead of stabilizing the market, \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 409]\n\u00a0\n it has caused a runaway market.'\n\n This on May 29th, within six months of the forming of the combination.\n These quotations are sufficient to show beyond discussion that the purpose of the organization, and especially of the frequent meetings, was to bring about a concerted effort to raise prices regardless of cost or merit, and so was unlawful, and that the members were soon entirely satisfied that the Plan was 'carrying out the purpose for which it was intended.'\n As to the price conditions during the year: Without going into detail, the record shows that the prices of the grades of hardwood in most general use were increased to an unprecedented extent during the year. Thus, the increases in prices of varieties of oak, range from 33.3 per cent. to 296 per cent. during the year; of gum, 60 per cent. to 343 per cent., and of ash, from 55 per cent. to 181 per cent. While it is true that 1919 was a year of high and increasing prices generally, and that wet weather may have restricted production to some extent, we cannot but agree with the members of the Plan them selves, as we have quoted them, and with the District Court, in the conclusion that the united action of this large and influential membership of dealers contributed greatly to this extraordinary price increase.\n Such close co-operation, between many persons, firms, and corporations controlling a large volume of interstate commerce, as is provided for in this Plan, is plainly in theory, as it proved to be in fact, inconsistent with that free and unrestricted trade which the statute contemplates shall be maintained, and that the persons conducting he association fully realized this is apparent from their protesting so often as they did, in many of their confidential communications appearing in this record, that their purposes were not unlawful, that they sought only to supplant cutthroat competition with what in their own judgment would be 'fair and reasonable competition,' and to obtain, not make, fair prices, and by their \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 410]\n\u00a0\n repeated insistence that the Sherman Law, 'designed to prevent the restraint of trade, is itself one of the greatest restrainers of trade, and should be repealed.'\n To call the activities of the defendants, as they are proved in this record, an 'Open Competition Plan' of action is plainly a misleading misnomer.\n Genuine competitors do not make daily, weekly, and monthly reports of the minutest details of their business to their rivals, as the defendants did; they do not contract, as was done here, to submit their books to the discretionary audit, and their stocks to the discretionary inspection, of their rivals, for the purpose of successfully competing with them; and they do not submit the details of their business to the analysis of an expert, jointly employed, and obtain from him a 'harmonized' estimate of the market as it is, and as, in his specially and confidentially informed judgment, it promises to be. This is not the conduct of competitors, but is so clearly that of men united in an agreement, express or implied, to act together and pursue a common purpose under a common guide that, if it did not stand confessed a combination to restrict production and inincrease prices in interstate commerce, and as, therefore, a direct restraint upon that commerce, as we have seen that it is, that conclusion must inevitably have been inferred from the facts which were proved. To pronounce such abnormal conduct on the part of 365 natural competitors, controlling onethird of the trade of the country in an article of prime necessity, a 'new form of competition,' and not an old form of combination in restraint of trade, as it so plainly is, would be for this court to confess itself blinded by words and forms to realities which men in general very plainly see, and understand and condemn, as an old evil in a new dress and with a new name.\n The Plan is, essentially, simply an expansion of the gentleman's agreement of former days, skillfully devised \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 411]\n\u00a0\n to evade the law. To call it open competition, because the meetings were nominally open to the public, or because some voluminous reports were transmitted to the Department of Justice, or because no specific agreement to restrict trade or fix prices is proved, cannot conceal the fact that the fundamental purpose of the Plan was to procure 'harmonious' individual action among a large number of naturally competing dealers with respect to the volume of production and prices, without having any specific agreement with respect to them, and to rely for maintenance of concerted action in both respects, not upon fines and forfeitures as in earlier days, out upon what experience has shown to be the more potent and dependable restraints, of business honor and social penalties-cautiously reinforced by many and elaborate reports, which would promptly expose to his associates any disposition in any member to deviate from the tacit understanding that all were to act together under the subtle direction of a single interpreter of their common purposes, as evidenced in the minute reports of what they had done and in their expressed purposes as to what they intended to do.\n In the presence of this record it is futile to argue that the purpose of the Plan was simply to furnish those engaged in this industry, with widely scattered units, the equivalent of such information as is contained in the newspaper and government publications with respect to the market for commodities sold on Boards of Trade or Stock Exchanges. One distinguishing and sufficient difference is that the published reports go to both seller and buyer, but these reports go to the seller only; and another is that there is no skilled interpreter of the published reports, such as we have in this case, to insistently recommend harmony of action likely to prove profitable in proportion as it is unitedly pursued.\n Convinced, as we are, that the purpose and effect of the activities of the Open Competition Plan, here \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 412]\n\u00a0\n under discussion, were to restrict competition, and thereby restrain interstate commerce in the manufacture and sale of hardwood lumber, by concerted action in curtailing production and in increasing prices, we agree with the District Court that it constituted a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 209), and the decree of that court must be\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n When there are competing sellers of a class of goods, knowledge of the total stock on hand, of the probable total demand, and of the prices paid, of course will tend to equalize the prices asked. But I should have supposed that the Sherman Act did not set itself against knowledge-did not aim at a transitory cheapness unprofitable to the community as a whole because not corresponding to the actual conditions of the country. I should have thought that the ideal of commerce was an intelligent interchange made with full knowledge of the facts as a basis for a forecast of the future on both sides. A combination to get and distribute such knowledge, notwithstanding its tendency to equalize, not necessarily to raise, prices, is very far from a combination in unreasonable restraint of trade. It is true that it is a combination of sellers only, but the knowledge acquired is not secret, it is public, and the buyers, I think I may assume, are not less active in their efforts to know the facts. A combination in unreasonable restraint of trade imports an attempt to override normal market conditions. An attempt to conform to them seems to me the most reasonable thing in the world. I see nothing in the conduct of the appellants that binds the members even by merely social sanctions to anything that would not be practised, if we could imagine it, by an allwise socialistic government acting for the benefit \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 413]\n\u00a0\n of the community as a whole. The parties to the combination are free to do as they will.\n I must add that the decree as it stands seems to me surprising in a country of free speech that affects to regard education and knowledge as desirable. It prohibits the distribution of stock, production, or sales reports, the discussion of prices at association meetings, and the exchange of predictions of high prices. It is true that these acts are the main evidence of the supposed conspiracy, but that to my mind only shows the weakness of the Government's case. I cannot believe that the fact, if it be assumed, that the acts have been done with a sinister purpose, justifies excluding mills in the backwoods from information, in order to enable centralized purchasers to take advantage of their ignorance of the facts.\n I agree with the more elaborate discussion of the case by my Brother BRANDEIS.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice MCKENNA concurs.\n There are more than 9,000 hardwood lumber mills in that part of the United States which lies east of a line extending from Minnesota to Texas. Three hundred and sixty-five concerns-each separate and independent-are members of an association by means of which they co-operate under the socalled 'Open Competition Plan.' Their mills-about 470 in number-are located in 18 states. Their aggregate production is about 30 per cent. of the total production of hardwood in the United States. The question presented for our decision is whether the Open Competition Plan, either inherently or as practiced by these concerns, violates the Sherman Law. The plan provides for co-operation in collecting and distributing information concerning the business of members and generally in regard to the trade. That in adopting the Plan the members formed a combination \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 414]\n\u00a0\n in trade is clear. Co-operation implies combination, and this combination confessedly relates to interstate trade. It is also clear that a plan for co-operation, although itself innocent, may be made an instrument by which illegal restraint is practiced. But the decree below should, in my opinion, be reversed, because the Plan is not inherently a restraint of trade, and the record is barren of evidence to support a finding that it has been used, or was intended to be used, as an instrument to restrain trade.\n Restraint of trade may be exerted upon rivals; upon buyers or upon sellers; upon employers or upon employed. Restraint may be exerted through force or fraud or agreement. It may be exerted through moral or through legal obligations; through fear or through hope. It may exist, although it is not manifested in any overt act, and even though there is no intent to restrain. Words of advice, seemingly innocent and perhaps benevolent, may restrain, when uttered under circumstances that make advice equivalent to command. For the essence of restraint is power; and power may arise merely out of position. Wherever a dominant position has been attained, restraint necessarily arises. And when dominance is attained, or is sought, through combination-however good the motives or the manners of those participating- the Sherman Law is violated, provided, of course, that the restraint be what is called unreasonable.\n In the case before us there was clearly no coercion. There is no claim that a monopoly was sought or created. There is no claim that a division of territory was planned or secured. There is no claim that uniform prices were established or desired. There is no claim that by agreement, force or fraud, any producer, dealer, or consumer was to be or has in fact been controlled or coerced. The Plan is a voluntary system for collecting from these independent concerns detailed information concerning the business operations of each, and its opinions as to trade \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 415]\n\u00a0\n conditions, prospects, and policy, and of collating, interpreting, and distributing the data so received among the members of the Association and others. No information gathered under the Plan was kept secret from any producer, any buyer, or the public. Ever since its inception in 1917, a copy of every report made and of every market letter published has been filed with the Department of Justice, and with the Federal Trade Commission. The district meetings were open to the public. Dealers and consumers were invited to participate in the discussions, and to some extent have done so.\n It is claimed that the purpose of the Open Competition Plan was to lessen competition. Competition among members was contemplated and was in vigorous operation. The Sherman Law does not prohibit every lessening of competition; and it certainly does not command that competition shall be pursued blindly, that business rivals shall remain ignorant of trade facts, or be denied aid in weighing their significance. It is lawful to regulate competition in some degree. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 U.S. 231\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 242. But it was neither the aim of the Plan, nor the practice under it, to regulate competition in any way. Its purpose was to make rational competition possible, by supplying data not otherwise available, and without which most of those engaged in the trade would be unable to trade intelligently.\n The hardwood lumber mills are widely scattered. The principal area of production is the Southern States. But there are mills in Minnesota, New York, New England, and the Middle States. Most plants are located near the sources of supply, isolated, remote from the larger cities and from the principal markets. No official, or other public, means have been established for collecting from these mills and from dealers data as to current production, stocks on hand, and market prices. Concerning grain, cotton, coal, and oil, the government collects and \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 416]\n\u00a0\n publishes regularly, at frequent intervals, current information on production, consumption, and stocks on hand; and Boards of Trade furnish freely to the public details of current market prices of those commodities, the volume of sales, and even individual sales, as recorded in daily transactions. Persons interested in such commodities are enabled through this information to deal with one another on an equal footing. The absence of such information in the hardwood lumber trade enables dealers in the large centers more readily to secure advantage over the isolated producer. And the large concerns, which are able to establish their own bureaus of statistics, secure an advantage over smaller concerns. Surely it is not against the public interest to distribute knowledge of trade facts, however detailed. Nor are the other features of the Plan-the market letters and the regional conferences-an unreasonable interference with freedom in trade. Intelligent conduct of business implies, not only knowledge of trade facts, but an understanding of them. To this understanding editorial comment and free discussion by those engaged in the business and by others interested are aids. Opinions expressed may be unsound; predictions may be unfounded; but there is nothing in the Sherman Law which should limit freedom of discussion, even among traders.\n It is insisted that there was a purpose to curtail production. No evidence of any such purpose was introduced. There was at no time uniformity in the percentage of production. to capacity. On the contrary, the evidence is uncontradicted that the high pricesinduced strenuous efforts to increase production. Weather and labor conditions had made production difficult. Tractors were purchased at great cost to get the logs out of the forests which excessive rains had rendered inaccessible to the usual methods of transport. The current sales of new machinery to hardwood lumber mills were on an unprece \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 417]\n\u00a0\n dented scale. Where equipment and supply of logs permitted, mills were run at night to overcome the restrictions upon production which the bad weather had imposed. There were, it is true, from time to time, warnings, in the 'Market Letters' and otherwise, against overproduction-warnings which seem not to have been heeded. But surely Congress did not intend by the Sherman Act to prohibit self-restraint-and it was for selfrestraint that the only appeal was made. The purpose of the warnings was to induce mill owners to curb their greed-lest both they and others suffer from the crushing evils of overproduction. Such warning or advice, whether given by individuals or the representatives of an association, presents no element of illegality.\n It is urged that this was a concerted effort to enhance prices. There was at no time uniformity in prices. So far as appears, every mill charged for its product as much as it could get. There is evidence that the hardwood mills expected, by adopting the Plan, to earn more in profits, and to do so, at least in part, by getting higher prices for their product. It may be that the distribution of the trade data, the editorial comment, and the conferences enabled the producers to obtain, on the average, higher prices than would otherwise have been possible. But there is nothing in the Sherman Law to indicate that Congress intended to condemn co-operative action in the exchange of information, merely because prophecy resulting from comment on the data collected may lead, for a period, to higher market prices. Congress assumed that the desire to acquire and to enjoy property is the safest and most promising basis for society, and to that end it sought, among other things, to protect the pursuit of business for private profit. Its purpose, obviously, was not to prevent the making of profits, or to counteract the operation of the law of supply and demand. Its purpose was merely to prevent restraint. The illegality of a combination \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 418]\n\u00a0\n under the Sherman Law lies, not in its effect upon the price level, but in the coercion thereby affected. It is the limitation of freedom, by agreements which narrow a market, as in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 96, and Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 307, or by organized boycott, as in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, and Eastern States Retail Lumber Co. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788, or by the coercive power of rebates, as in Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322, which constitutes the unlawful restraint.\n The co-operation which is incident to this plan does not suppress competition. On the contrary, it tends to promote all in competition which is desirable. By substituting knowledge for ignorance, rumor, guess, and suspicion, it tends also to substitute research and reasoning for gambling and piracy, without closing the door to adventure, or lessening the value of prophetic wisdom. In making such knowledge available to the smallest concern, it creates among producers equality of opportunity. In making it available, also, to purchasers and the general public, it does all that can actually be done to protect the community from extortion. If, as is alleged, the Plan tends to substitute stability in prices for violent fluctuations, its influence, in this respect, is not against the public interest. The evidence in this case, far from establishing an illegal restraint of trade, presents, in my opinion, an instance of commendable effort by concerns engaged in a chaotic industry to make possible its intelligent conduct under competitive conditions.\n The refusal to permit a multitude of small rivals to co-operate, as they have done here, in order to protect themselves and the public from the chaos and havoc wrought in their trade by ignorance, may result in suppressing competition in the hardwood industry. These keen business rivals, who sought through co-operative exchange of trade information to create conditions under which alone rational \n\n[257 U.S. 377, 419]\n\u00a0\n competition is possible, produce in the aggregate about one-third of the hardwood lumber of the country. This court held in United States v. U. S. Steel Corporation, \n251 U.S. 417\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121, that it was not unlawful to vest in a single corporation control of 50 per cent. of the steel industry of the country; and in United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., \n247 U.S. 32\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 473, the court held that it was not unlawful to vest in single corporation control of practically the whole shoe machinery industry. May not these hardwood lumber concerns, frustrated in their efforts to rationalize competition, be led to enter the inviting filed of consolidation? And, if they do, may not another huge trust, with highly centralized control over vast resources, natural, manufacturing, and financial, become so powerful as to dominate competitors, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, employees, and, in large measure, the community? \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES v. TRI-CITY CENTRAL TRADES COUNCIL(1921)\nNo. 313\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1921\n\n\n Trades Council \n257 U.S. 184\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[257 U.S. 184, 186]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Max Pam, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank C. Smith, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Steel Foundries is a New Jersey corporation operating a large plant for the manufacture of steel products in Granite City, Ill. In May, 1914, it filed a bill in the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois to enjoin the defendants, the Tri-City Central Trades Council, and 14 individual defendants, some of them officers of the Council, all of them citizens of other states than New Jersey, from carrying on a conspiracy to prevent complainant from retaining and obtaining skilled laborers to operate its plant. The bill charged that the conspiracy was being executed by organized picketing, accompanied by threats, intimidation and violence toward persons employed or seeking employment there. The defendants in their answer admitted that the Central Trades Council had established a picket upon streets leading to the plant, with instructions to notify all persons entering it that a strike had been called because of reduction of wages, and to use all honorable means to persuade such persons not to take the places of the men on the strike; admitted the participation of individual defendants in the picketing, but denied threats of injury or violence or responsibility for the violence that admittedly had occurred. After replication was filed, the cause was heard. A restraining order issued on filing of the bill, and a final decree was entered by which defendants were--\n'perpetually restrained and enjoined from in any way or manner whatsoever by use of persuasion, threats, or personal injury, intimidation, suggestion of danger or threats of violence of any kind, interfering with, hindering, obstructing or stopping any person engaged in the employ of the American Steel Foundries in connection with its business or its foundry in the city of \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n Granite City, county of Madison, state of Illinois, or elsewhere, and from interfering by persuasion, violence or threats of violence, in any manner with any person desiring to be employed by said American Steel Foundries in its said foundry or plant, and from inducing or attempting to compel or induce by persuasion, threats, intimidation, force or violence or putting in fear or suggestions of danger any of the employees of the American Steel Foundries or persons seeking employment with it so as to cause them to refuse to perform any of their duties as employees of the American Steel Foundries, and from preventing any person by persuasion, threats, intimidation, force or violence, or suggestion of danger or violence, from entering into the employ of said American Steel Foundreies, and from protecting, aiding or assisting any person or persons in committing any of said acts, and from assembling, loitering or congregating about or in proximity of the said plant or factory of the American Steel Foundries for the purpose of doing, or aiding or encouraging others in doing, any of the said unlawful or forbidden acts or things, and from picketing or maintaining at or near the premises of the complainant, or on the streets leading to the premises of said complainant, any picket or pickets, and from doing any acts or things whatever in furtherance of any conspiracy or combination among them, or any of them, to obstruct, or interfere with said American Steel Foundries, its officers, agents or employees, in the free and unrestrained control and operation of its plant, foundry and property and the operation of its business, and also from ordering, directing, aiding, assisting or in any manner abetting any person committing any or either of the acts aforesaid, and also from entering upon the grounds, foundry, or premises of the American Steel Foundries without first obtaining its consent, and from injuring or destroying any of the property of the said American Steel Foundries.' \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n There were 12 assignments of error on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, but the important ones which raised the issue in this case were as follows:\n\n'Eight. Because the complainant was not entitled to an injunction prohibiting the defendants while on the streets of Granite City or while in proximity to such foundry, from trying to persuade strike breakers from taking the places of the strikers.\n\n'Ninth. Because the complainant was not entitled to an injunction prohibiting the defendants from stopping employees of complainant and suggesting to them that they should not work at such plant while a strike was on.\n\n'Tenth. Because the complainant was not entitled to an injunction prohibiting the defendants from assembling, or congregating, in proximity of said foundry, or on the streets leading to such foundry.\n\n'Eleventh. Because the complainant was not entitled to an injunction prohibiting the defendants from placing any picket, or pickets, upon the streets leading to such foundry, whose duty it was to notify those entering said foundry that there was a strike on.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals modified the final decree by striking out the word 'persuasion' in the four places in which it occurred, and by inserting after the clause restraining picketing the following: 'In a threatening or intimidating manner.' Fed. 728.\n The Tri-City Central Trades Council is a labor organization composed of representatives of 37 trade unions of Granite City, Madison and Venice, adjoining towns in Illinois, including among them electricians, cranemen, mill hands, machinists, and stationary engineers. In April, 1914, the complainant, which ordinarily in full operation employed 1,600 men and, whose plant had been shut down since November of the previous year, resumed operations with about 350 of its regular men, 150 of whom belonged to the skilled trades, electricians, \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 196]\n\u00a0\n cranemen, mill hands, machinists and blacksmiths. At this trial, the works manager testified:\n'When we opened April 6th we employed whoever we saw fit, whoever applied for employment at the gate. We had only called for in round numbers 300 men and laid off approximately 1,300. Eighty or 90 per cent. of the employees were old men. I assume these men were members of various organizations; I can't state definitely as to that.'\n\n When business was resumed in April, half of skilled workmen were given wages at rates from 2 cents to 10 cents an hour below those paid before the plant had shut down. The Trades Council was advised of this about April 15th, and appointed a committee to secure reinstatement of the previous wages. The manager of the complainant told them that he ran an open shop, did not recognize organized labor and would not deal with the committee, but would entertain any complaint by an employee. The Council thereupon, on April 22d, declared a strike on complainant's plant and displayed outside of the entrance to the plant a printed notice announcing that a strike was on at the plant and calling on union men and all labor to remain away from the works in order that an increase in wages might be secured. Only two men, defendants Churchill and Cook, acted upon the order to strike. Churchill was a member of the Machinist's Union. Cook was not a member of any union. The Council then established a picket, which was carried on for 3 or 4 weeks without intermission until the bill was filed on May 18th, and a restraining order issued.\n Complainant's plant was in an enclosure of 25 acres and fronted on Niedringhaus avenue. The Wabash and other railroads crossed this street and ran along the side of the plant. There were four tracks. The timekeeper's gate of the plant opened on to the tracks. Directly opposite on the other side of the tracks was the Wabash depot, from 300 to 400 feet from the \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 197]\n\u00a0\n plant. It was on Niedringhaus avenue, and this street was the one used by many of the plant's employees in going to their homes in Granite City and in reaching the terminal of the street car line which many used. Complainant's employees testified that just as the picketing began, they were warned by some of the defendants that they would be hurt if they did not quit. The master mechanic of the plant, Hall, testified that Lamb, one of the defendants, the national representative of the Machinist's Union at St. Louis, when in company with 4 other pickets, handed him the circular of the Trades Council, and told him:\n'We don't like the way you have treated our boys down here, and we just came down to raise a little hell.'\n\n Lamb admitted saying to Hall that the cut in wages was a severe one and that it looked as though they were going to raise hell in the town because conditions were good; that he did not like to see a fight going on, but it looked as though it would come. The evidence showed that the pickets would stand about near the Wabash tracks, sometimes on the foundries' side, sometimes on the depot side, sometimes on Niedringhaus avenue, and that there were 3 or 4 groups of them varying from 4 to a dozen in each group. The headquarters of all the groups was at the Wabash depot.\n There was an assault on April 30th, in which one Haefner, an employee, was attacked by 3 of the picketers. On May 8th, a man named Crabtree and 4 other employees were attacked by a group of more than 7 of the pickets. On May 13th, another assault occurred, which developed into a mob, and 2 witnesses for complainant swore positively that the president of the Trades Council, Galloway, was engaged in this disturbance and was throwing bricks. There were other assaults, the last one on May 18th, before the restraining order issued that day reached the picketers. Officers of the company testified that a number of men wounded in these assaults \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 198]\n\u00a0\n were brought into the plant. All disturbances ceased after the restraining orders were served.\n Galloway testified he was present at the plant 3 mornings for about 15 or 20 minutes, and 4 or 5 evenings for maybe half an hour; that he engaged in no violence while he was there and saw none; that the representatives of the Central Trades were there doing picket duty, and that the closest he saw them to the plant was 20 feet in front of Wabash depot; that the Central Trades did not instruct anybody to assault any one, but told them to picket the streets leading to the plant, and ask the men not to go into the plant or take work under the reduced wages. He said that the pickets were selected from the different crafts interested in the wages; that the joint board of the Council placed the pickets where they were, and the Council then sanctioned this action. He said he went down there to see that things were going right; that they placed the pickets there to prevent, if possible, the men from entering and working at the plant until they arbitrated the difference or advanced their wages to the former scale; that the pickets were not authorized to commit an unlawful act.\n B. F. Lamb, already referred to, visited Granite City because he had a local union there affiliated with the Tr-City Trades Council. He went there 3 times a week during the strike, and did picket duty. He was on the picket line itself, which was about 100 or 120 yards from the plant. Pickets were merely there to convey information and ask co-operation. He denied that they authorized any assaults and he saw no assaulting. He heard of some fights which took place away from the plant, but he was in no way connected with them.\n Hartbeck, who was business agent and sectetary of the Blacksmith's Union, said that he acted on the picket line every time he went over there, sometimes in the evening, sometimes at noontime. He said the pickets would approach \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 199]\n\u00a0\n a man and tell him the conditions and request him to come out; that he did that himself, but that he never threatened any one and never used any violence of any kind. He said:\n'In my estimation the 4 or 5 witnesses who swore to my presence at different times to assault testified falsely. When the reduction of wages took effect, I was ordered by the superior of our District Board to go over there and to have men over there that would go to work to have them come out if they could under reduction of wages; probably some of our union men would go in unbeknowns of the trouble. At the time I went over there none of our men were at work in the plant because they had been sent for. But I went over anyway.'\n\n Harry McKenney, a picket, testified that he did assault one of the follows there; that he, Churchill, and another picket were standing together, and that he told a man named Haefner, an employee, to stay away from the building; that Haefner called him an insulting and profane name, and said he would work where he pleased, and that then he hit Haefner; that he never tried to stop anybody from going into the plant by force; that he did hit Haefner while he was on the picket line; that he did not hit him because he was going into the works, but just because he called him a bad name.\n Churchill, a striker and picket, said he 'never struck a man over there-he merely warned them, asked them to stay out of there; better keep away.' He said that he was present when Haefner was hit by McKenney for calling him a bad name, that Haefner begged them not to hit him again, but McKenney hit him twice. Then Haefner said he was going home. Churchill said he was present when the porter from the plant was bringing in two lunch baskets; that some one kicked the baskets out of the porter's hands. Churchill said he was in the 'bunch' standing there, but he did not know who the man was \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 200]\n\u00a0\n that upset them. He said two or three fights took place, and that he ( Churchill) saw the big one with 200 men in it. He was half a block away.\n Ishman, another picketer, said he was a craneman and resided at Granite City; that he was a member of the Cranesmen's Union; that he did picket duty during the strike; that he was there quite a bit morning and evening; that the duty of the pickets was to inform the employees of the plant that there was a strike on, and to inform them of the conditions under which they were working. He said that, on May 8th, Crabtree, an employee, and 4 other employees, were coming across the railroad tracks from their work; that they had 7 pickets there. He said they got to talking to them, and somebody started a fight; he said somebody made a pass at him, and that he hit somebody. He said they claimed it was Crabtree; that it was 150 yards from the plant.\n Cook, a defendant, who was not a union man, went out with the strike. He said he left because he did not like his wages, and quit because there was a strike on. Nobody sent him there as a picket, but he joined them, and they were all together picketing and talking to some men going to or coming from work. He said he wanted to quit work and did not want anybody else to work in his place.\n It is clear from the evidence that, from the outset, violent methods were pursued from time to time in such a way as to characterize the attitude of the picketers as continuously threatening. A number of employees, sometimes 15 or more, slept in the plant for a week during the trouble, because they could not safely go to their homes. The result of the campaign was to put employees and would-be employees in such fear that many abandoned work, and this seriously interfered with the complainant in operating the plant until the issue of the restraining order. \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 201]\n\u00a0\n The first question in the case is whether section 20 of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, chapter 323, 38 Stat. 738 (Comp. St.  1243d), is to be applied in this case. The act was passed while this case was pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals. In Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 464\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172, a suit to restrain a secondary boycott had been brought before the passage of the act, but did not come to hearing until after its passage. It was held that because relief by injunction operates in futuro and the right to it must be determined as of the time of the hearing, section 20 of the act relating to injunctions was controlling in so far that decrees entered after its passage should conform to its provisions. The decree here appeled from in the District Court had been entered before the Clayton Act passed. But the whole cause was taken up by the appeal. The complainant had no vested right in the decree of the District Court while it was subject to review. Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., \n257 U.S. 226\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 71, this day announced. The Circuit Court of Appeals was called upon to approve or to change the decree and was obliged, therefore, to regard the new statute in its conclusion, and so are we.\n Section 20 is as follows:\n'That no restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employes, or between employers and employes, or between employes, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney. \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 202]\n\u00a0\n 'And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means to do so; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.'\n\n It has been determined by this court that the irreparable injury to property or to a property right, in the first paragraph of section 20, includes injury to the business of an employer, and that the second paragraph applied only in cases growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, between an employer and meployee, between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, and not to such dispute between an employer and persons who are neither ex-employees nor seeking employment. Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 U.S. 443\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 172. Only two of the defendants, Cook and Churchill, who left at the time of the strike, can invoke in their behalf section 20. We must, therefore, first consider the propriety of the decree as against them, and then as against the other defendants. \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 203]\n\u00a0\n The prohibitions of section 20, material here, are those which forbid an injunction against, first, recommending, advising or persuading others by peaceful means to cease employment and labor; second, attending at any place where such person or persons may lawfully be for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; third, peaceably assembling in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes. This court has already called attention in the Duplex Case to the emphasis upon the words 'peaceable' and 'lawful' in this section. \n254 \nU.S. 443, 473\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172. It is clear that Congress wished to forbid the use by the federal courts of their equity arm to prevent peaceable persuasion by employees, discharged or expectant, in promotion of their side of the dispute, and to secure them against judicial restraint in obtaining or communicating information in any place where they might lawfully be. This introduces no new principle into the equity jurisprudence of those courts. It is merely declaratory of what was the best practice always. Congress thought it wise to stabilize this rule of action and render it uniform.\n The object and problem of Congress in section 20, and indeed of courts of equity before its enactment, was to reconcile the rights of the employer in his business and in the access of his employees to his place of business and egress therefrom without intimidation or obstruction, on the one hand, and the right of the employees, recent or expectant, to use peaceable and lawful means to induce present employees and would-be employees to join their ranks, on the other. If in their attempts at persuasion or communication with those whom they would enlist with them, those of the labor side adopt methods which however lawful in their announced purpose inevitably lead to intimidation and obstruction, then it is the court's duty which the terms of section 20 do not modify, so to limit what \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 204]\n\u00a0\n the propagandists do as to time, manner and place as shall prevent infractions of the law and violations of the right of the employees, and of the employer for whom they wish to work.\n How far may men go in persuasion and communication and still not violate the right of those whom they would influence? In going to and from work, men have a right to as free a passage without obstruction as the streets afford, consistent with the right of others to enjoy the same privilege. We are a social people and the accosting by one of another in an inoffensive way and an offer by one to communicate and discuss information with a view to influencing the other's action are not regarded as aggression or a violation of that other's rights. If, however, the offer is declined, as it may rightfully be, then persistence, importunity, following and dogging become unjustifiable annoyance and obstruction which is likely soon to savor of intimidation. From all of this the person sought to be influenced has a right to be free and his employer has a right to have him free.\n The nearer this importunate intercepting of employees or would-be employees is to the place of business, the greater the obstruction and interference with the business and especially with the property right of access of the employer. Attempted discussion and argument of this kind in such proximity is certain to attract attention and congregation of the curious, or, it may be, interested bystanders, and thus to increase the obstruction as well as the aspect of intimidation which the situation quickly assumes. In the present case the 3 or 4 groups of picketers, were made up of from 4 to 12 in a group. They constituted the picket line. Each union interested, electricians, cranemen, machinists and blacksmiths, had several representatives on the picket line, and assaults and violence ensued. They began early and continued from time to time during the 3 weeks of the strike \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 205]\n\u00a0\n after the picketing began. All information tendered, all arguments advanced and all persuasion used under such circumstances were intimidation. They could not be otherwise. It is idle to talk of peaceful communication in such a place and under such conditions. The numbers of the pickets in the groups constituted intimidation. The name 'picket' indicated a militant purpose, inconsistent with peaceable persuasion. The crowds they drew made the passage of the employees to and from the place of work, one of running the gauntlet. Persuasion or communication attempted in such a presence and under such conditions was anything but peaceable and lawful. When one or more assaults or disturbances ensued, they characterized the whole campaign, which became effective because of its intimidating character, in spite of the admonitions given by the leaders to their followers as to lawful methods to be pursued, however sincere. Our conclusion is that picketing thus instituted is unlawful and can not be peaceable and may be properly enjoined by the specific term because its meaning is clearly understood in the sphere of the controversy by those who are parties to it. We are supported in that view by many well reasoned authorities, although there has been contrariety of view. Barnes v. Typographical Union, 232 Ill. 425, 83 N. E. 932, 14 L. R. A. (N.

But while this is so, we must have every regard to the congressional intention manifested in the act and to the principle of existing law which it declared, that ex-employees and others properly acting with them shall have an opportunity, so far as is consistent with peace and law, to observe who are still working for the employer, to communicate with them and to persuade them to join the ranks of his opponents in a lawful economic struggle. Regarding as primary, the rights of the employees to work for whom they will, and, undisturbed by annoying importunity or intimidation of numbers, to go freely to and from their place of labor, and keeping in mind the right of the employer incident to his property and business to free access of such employees, what can be done to reconcile the conflicting interests?\n Each case must turn on its own circumstances. It is a case for the flexible remedial power of a court of equity which may try one mode of restraint, and if it fails or proves to be too drastic, may change it. We think that the strikers and their sympathizers engaged in the economic struggle should be limited to one representative for each point of ingress and egress in the plant or place of business and that all others be enjoined from congregating or loitering at the plant or in the neighboring streets by which access is had to the plant, that such representatives should have the right of observation, communication \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 207]\n\u00a0\n and persuasion, but with special admonition that their communication, arguments and appeals shall not be abusive, libelous or threatening, and that they shall not approach individuals together but singly, and shall not in their single efforts at communication or persuasion obstruct an unwilling listener by importunate following or dogging his steps. This is not laid down as a rigid rule, but only as one which should apply to this case under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence and which may be varied in other cases. It becomes a question for the judgment of the chancellor who has heard the witnesses, familiarized himself with the locus in quo and observed the tendencies to disturbance and conflict. The purpose should be to prevent the inevitable intimidation of the presence of groups of pickets, but to allow missionaries.\n With these views, it is apparent that we can not sustain the qualification of the order of the District Court which the Circuit Court of Appeals made. That court followed the case of Iron Moulders Union v. Allis-Chalmers Co., 166 Fed. 45, 91 C. C. A. 631, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 315, and modified the order of the District Court which enjoined defendants 'from picketing or maintaining at or near the premises of the complainant or on the streets leading to the premises of said complainant, any pickets and pickets' by adding the words 'in a threatening or intimidating manner.' This qualification seems to us to be inadequate. In actual result, it leaves compliance largely to the discretion of the pickets. It ignores the necessary element of intimidation in the presence of groups as pickets. It does nto secure practically that which the court must secure and to which the complainant and his workmen are entitled. The phrase really recognizes as legal that which bears the sinister name of 'picketing' which it is to be observed Congress carefully refrained from using in section 20.\n There remains to consider, so far as defendants Churchill and Cook, the ex-employees, are concerned, the \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 208]\n\u00a0\n part of the decree of the District Court which forbade them by persuasion to induce employees, or would-be employees to leave, or stay out of, complainant's employ. The effect of it is to enjoin persuasion by them at any time or place. This certainly conflicts with section 20 of the Clayton Act. The decree must be modified as to these two defendants by striking out the word 'persuasion.'\n The second important question in the case is as to the form of decree against the Tri-City Trades Council and the other defendants. What has been said as to picketing applies to them, of course, as fully as to the ex-employees, but how as to the injunction against persuasion?\n The argument made on behalf of the American Foundries in support of enjoining persuasion is that the Tri-City Central Trades Council and the other defendants being neither employees nor strikers were intruders into the controversy, and were engaged without excuse in an unlawful conspiracy to injury the American Fourdries by enticing its employees, and, therefore, should be enjoined.\n It is to be noted, that while there was only one member of the unions of the Trades Council who went out in the strike, the number of skilled employees then engaged by the Foundries was not one-quarter of the whole number of men who would be engaged when it was in full operation. The works manager said that 80 or 90 per cent. of the employees were old men and that he assumed these men were members of various organizations. Other witnesses, members of the unions, testified that they had been employees of complainant in the previous fall. It is thus probable that members of the local unions were looking forward to employment when complainant should resume full operation and even though they were not ex-employees within the Clayton Act, they were directly interested in the wages which were to be paid.\n Is interference of a labor organization by persuasion and appeal to induce a strike against low wages, under \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 209]\n\u00a0\n such circumstances without lawful excuse and malicious? We think not. Labor unions are recognized by the Clayton Act as legal when instituted for mutual help and lawfully carrying out their legitimate objects. They have long been thus recognized by the courts. They were organized out of the necessities of the situation. A single employee was helpless in dealing with an employer. He was dependent ordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and family. If the employer refused to pay him the wages that he thought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employ and to resist arbitrary and unfair treatment. Union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on equality with their employer. They united to exert influence upon him and to leave him in a body in order by this inconvenience to induce him to make better terms with them. They were withholding their labor of economic value to make him pay what they thought it was worth. The right to combine for such a lawful purpose has in many years not been denied by any court. The strike became a lawful instrument in a lawful economic struggle or competition between employer and employees as to the share or division between them of the joint product of labor and capital. To render this combination at all effective, employees must make their combination extend beyond one shop. It is helpful to have as many as may be in the same trade in the same community united, because in the competition between employers they are bound to be affected by the standard of wages of their trade in the neighborhood. Therefore, they may use all lawful propaganda to enlarge their membership and especially among those whose labor at lower wages will injure their whole guild. It is impossible to hold such whole guild. It is impossible to hold such persuasion and propaganda without more, to be without excuse and malicious. The principle of the unlawfulness of maliciously enticing laborers still remains and action may be maintained therefor in proper cases, \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 210]\n\u00a0\n but to make it applicable to local labor unions, in such a case as this, seems to us to be unreasonable.\n The elements essential to sustain actions for persuading employees to leave an employer are first, the malice or absence of lawful excuse, and, second, the actual injury. The effect of cases cited as authority must be determined by an examination of the pleadings and facts to see how the malice or lack of lawful excuse was established, and whether there was not illegality present in the means used. Thus Walker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555, and Thacker Coal Co. v. Burke, 59 W. Va. 253, 53 S. E. 161, 5 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1091, 8 Ann. Cas. 885, suits by an employer against members of a labor union in which the right of action for persuading was sustained, were heard on demurrer to the complaint. The element of malice was supplied by averment of the complaint, and was of course, admitted by the demurrer. There are other cases in which the persuasion was accompanied by the intent to secure a breach of contract, or was part of a secondary boycott or had elements of fraud, misrepresentation or intimidation in it. Perkins v. Pendleton, 90 Me. 166, 38 Atl. 96, 60 Am. St. Rep. 252, was a case of the latter kind. In Lucke v. Clothing Cutters, 77 Md. 396, 26 Atl. 505, 19 L. R. A. 408, 39 Am. St. Rep. 421 it was held unlawful in a labor union to seek to compel an employer to discharge the plaintiff by intimidation, and it was said that the state law authorizing formation of Trade Unions to secure most favorable conditions for labor of their members was not a warrant for making war upon the nonunion man or for illegal interference with his rights and privileges. A suit by an employee, who seeks to hold a labor union liable for seeking his discharge by threatening to strike unless his employer discharges him, stands on a different footing from a mere effort by a labor union to persuade employees to leave their employment. There are in such a combination against an employee the suggestions of coercion, attempted monopoly, deprivation of livelihood and remoteness of the legal purpose of the union to better its members' \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 211]\n\u00a0\n condition, not present in a case like the present. Without entering into a discussion of those cases which include Brennan v. United Hatters of North America, 73 N. J. Law, 729, 65 Atl. 165, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 254, 118 Am. St. Rep. 727, 9 Ann. Cas. 698, Curran v. Galen, 152 N. Y. 33, 46 N. E. 297, 37 L. R. A. 802, 57 Am. St. Rep. 496, Berry v. Donavan, 188 Mass. 354, 74 N. E. 603, 5 L. R. A. (N. S.) 899, 108 Am. St. Rep. 499, 3 Ann. Cas. 738, and Plant v. Woods, 176 Mass. 492, 57 N. E. 1011, 51 L. R. A. 339, 79 Am. St. Rep. 330, it is sufficient to say they do not apply here.\n The counsel for the Steel Foundries rely on two cases in this Court to support their contention. The first is that of the Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 U.S. 229\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461. The principle followed in the Hitchman Case cannot be invoked here. There the action was by a coal mining company of West Virginia against the officers of an International Labor Union and others to enjoin them from carrying out a plan to bring the employees of the complainant company and all the West Virginia mining companies into the International Union, so that the Union could control, through the union employees, the production and sale of coal in West Virginia, in competition with the mines of Ohio and other states. The plan thus projected was carried out in the case of the complainant company by the use of deception and misrepresentation with its nonunion employees, by seeking to induce such employees to become members of the union contrary to the express term of their contract of employment that they would not remain in complainant's employ if union men, and after enough such employees had been secretly secured, suddenly to declare a strike against complainant and to leave it in a helpless situation in which it would have to consent to be unionized. This court held that the purpose was not lawful, and that the means were not lawful and that the defendants were thus engaged in an unlawful conspiracy which should be enjoined. The unlawful and deceitful means used were quite enough to sustain the decision of the court without more. The statement of the purpose of the plan is sufficient to show the remoteness of the benefit ultimately to be derived by \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 212]\n\u00a0\n the members of the International Union from its success and the formidable, country-wide and dangerous character of the control of interstate commerce sought. The circumstances of the case make it no authority for the contention here.\n The Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 U.S. 443\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 172 also cited, can have no bearing here. In that case, the International Association of Machinists, an unincorporated association, having a membership of more than 60,000, united in a combination to compel the complainant to unionize its factory, enforce the closed shop, the 8- hour day and the union scale of wages by boycotting the interstate trade of that company. They conducted in the city of New York a campaign of threatening the customers of the Printing Press Company, the trucking companies that carried its presses, and those who were engaged in the work of setting up such presses, with injury to them in their business, if they continued to deal with the Duplex Company or its presses. It was a palpable effort on the part of the International Union of Machinists to institute a secondary boycott, that is, by coercion, to use the right of trade of persons having nothing to do with the controversy between the Duplex Company and the Machinist's Union, and having no interest in it, to injure the Duplex Company in its interstate trade. This was decided not to be within section 20 of the Clayton Act, but was held, following the case of Loewe v. Lawler, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, to be an unlawful combination in restraint of interstate trade. The Hitchman Case was cited in the Duplex Case, but there is nothing in the ratio decidendi of either which limits our conclusion here, or which requires us to hold that the members of a local labor union and the union itself do not have sufficient interest in the wages paid to the employees of any employer in the community to justify their use of lawful and peaceable persuasion to induce those employees to refuse to accept such reduced wages \n\n[257 U.S. 184, 213]\n\u00a0\n and to quit their employment. For this reason, we think that the restraint from persuasion included within the injunction of the District Court was improper, and in that regard the decree must also be modified. In this we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case is remanded to the District Court for modification of its decree in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in substance in the opinion and the judgment of the Court.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES v.

U S(1921)\nNo. 114\nArgued: December 13, 1920Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. H. Obear and Charles A. Douglas, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, whom we shall designate defendant as he was in the court below, was tried on an indictment containing six counts. He was found not guilty on the first four counts, but guilty on the fifth, which charged him with having removed whisky on which the revenue tax had not been paid to a place other than a government warehouse, and also on the sixth, which charged him with having sold whisky on which the tax required by law had not been paid.\n After the jury was sworn, but before any evidence was offered, the defendant presented to the court a petition, duly sworn to by him, praying that there be returned to him described private property of his which it was averred the District Attorney intended to use in evidence at the trial and which had been seized by P. J. Coleman and C. A. Rector, officers of the government, in a search of defendant's house and store 'within his curtilage,' made unlawfully and without warrant of any kind, in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n Upon reading of this petition and hearing of the application \n\n[255 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n it was denied, and exception being noted, the trial proceeded.\n Coleman and Rector were called as witnesses by the government and testified: That as deputy collectors of internal revenue, they went to defendant's home, and, not finding him there, but finding a woman who said she was his wife, told her that they were revenue officers and had come to search the premises 'for violations of the revenue law'; that thereupon the woman opened the store and the witnesses entered, and in a barrel of peas found a bottle containing not quite a half pint of illicitly distilled whisky, which they called 'blockade whisky'; and that they then went into the home of defendant, and on searching found two bottles under the quilt on the bed, one of which contained a full quart and the other a little over a quart of illicitly distilled whisky. The government introduced in evidence a pint bottle containing whisky, which the witness Coleman stated 'was not one of the bottles found by him, but that the whisky contained in the same was poured out of one of the two bottles that had been found in defendant's house on the bed under the quilt, as stated.' On cross-examination both witnesses testified that they did not have any warrant for the arrest of the defendant, nor any search warrant to search his house, and that the search was made during the daytime, in the absence of the defendant, who did not appear on the scene until after the search had been made.\n After these two government witnesses had described how the search was made of defendant's home without warrant either to arrest him or to search his premises, a motion by counsel to strike out their testimony was denied and exception noted.\n This statement shows that the trial court denied the petition of the defendant for a return of his property, seized in the search of his home by government agents without warrant of any kind, in plain violation of the \n\n[255 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as they have been interpreted and applied by this court in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524, in Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, and in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 U.S. 385\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 182, and also denied his motion to exclude such property and the testimony relating thereto given by the government agents after both were introduced in evidence against him, when he was on trial for a crime as to which they constituted relevant and material evidence, if competent.\n The answer of the government to the claim that the trial court erred in the two rulings we have described is that the petition for the return of defendant's property was properly denied, because it came too late when presented after the jury was impaneled and the trial, to that extent, commenced, and that the denial of the motion to exclude the property and the testimony of the government agents relating thereto, after the manner of the search of defendant's home had been described, was justified by the rule that in the progress of the trial of criminal cases courts will not stop to frame a collateral issue to inquire whether evidence offered, otherwise competent, was lawfully or unlawfully obtained.\n Plainly the questions thus presented for decision are ruled by the conclusions this day announced in No. 250, Felix Gouled v. United States, \n255 U.S. 298\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 261, 65 L. Ed.--.\n There is nothing in the record to indicate that the allegations of the petition for the return of the property, sworn to by the defendant, were in any respect questioned or denied, and the report of the examination and appropriate cross-examination of the government's witnesses, called to make out its case, shows clearly the unconstitutional character of the seizure by which the property which it introduced was obtained. The facts essential to the disposition of the motion were not and could not be denied; they were literally thrust upon the attention of the court \n\n[255 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n by the government itself. The petition should have been granted; but, it having been denied, the motion should have been sustained.\n The contention that the constitutional rights of defendant were waived when his wife admitted to his home the government officers, who came, without warrant, demanding admission to make search of it under government authority, cannot be entertained. We need not consider whether it is possible for a wife, in the absence of her husband, thus to waive his constitutional rights, for it is perfectly clear that under the implied coercion here presented, no such waiver was intended or effected.\n It results that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANCHOR OIL CO. v. GRAY(1921)\nNo. 188\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 519, 520]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Devereux, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellant.\n Mr. Preston C. West, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity instituted by appellant against appellees in a state court of Oklahoma, involving the ownership of a leasehold estate for oil and gas mining purposes in a Creek Indian allotment containing 80 acres, situate i Tulsa county, Okl. Upon petition of appellees it was removed to the United States District Court upon the ground that it arose under the Constitution and laws of the United States; a motion to dismiss the suit was granted by that court, the decree of dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (257 Fed. 277, 168 C. C. A. 361), and an appeal brings the case here.\n From appellant's amended petition it appears that the 80 acres were allotted to Jennie Samuels, a full-blood Creek Indian, as her distributive share of the lands of the tribe, and patented to her in the year 1903. December 5, 1914, pursuant to the Act of Congress of May 27, 1908, c. 199 ,  2 (35 Stat. 312), and the rules and regulations \n\n[256 U.S. 519, 521]\n\u00a0\n of the Secretary of the Interior, she made an oil and gas mining lease to McDonnell and Egan covering the lands in controversy, and this was filed in the office of the United States Indian agent (now designated as Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes), Union Agency, at Muskogee, on January 5, 1915. It was forwarded by the agent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with a favorable recommendation October 14, 1915; submitted by the Commissioner to the Secretary of the Interior for approval, and by him approved October 21, 1915. It was first filed for record in the county clerk's office of Tulsa county on August 10, 1916. Appellees are the owners of this lease, and are in possession of the lands.\n Jennie Samuels died intestate October 11, 1915 (10 days before the Secretary's approval of the above lease), leaving as her heirs a daughter, Feney Rogers, and a granddaughter, Lina White, both full-blood Creek Indians, and to them the lands descended, subject to the lease. In the following December they made oil and gas leases to one Williams covering the same 80 acres, which were approved by the county court having jurisdiction of the estate of Jennie Samuels, and were recorded in the county records prior to August 10, 1916. These leases are held by appellant, whose interest was acquired, according to the averments of the petition, without knowledge or notice of the lease made by Jennie Samuels.\n Appellees, having entered into possession, commenced drilling and discovered and produced petroleum and natural gas in paying quantities. This suit was commenced in January, 1917, appellant praying that their lease be canceled and they enjoined from interfering with appellant in the possession of the premises, and required to account.\n Like the courts below, we find it unnecessary to consider the inherent volidity or invalidity of appellant's \n\n[256 U.S. 519, 522]\n\u00a0\n title, because we conclude that that of appellees is good and has priority over it. The authority of the Secretary of the Interior to approve and thereby confirm oil and gas mining leases made by full-blood Creek allottees upon their allotments-derived from section 2 of the Act of May 27, 1908-did not cease at the death of the allottee by reason of the provision of section 9 of the same act (35 Stat. 315):\n'That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, that no conveyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee.'\n\n The validity of the lease made by Jennie Samuels having been conditioned upon the approval of the Secretary, such approval might be given at any time either before or after her death, so far as the rights of her heirs and those claiming under them with notice were concerned, and the approval when given related back and took effect as of the execution of the lease by the parties named therein. Pickering v. Lomax, \n145 \nU.S. 310, 314\n, 316 S., 12 Sup. Ct. 860; Lomax v. Pickering, \n173 \nU.S. 26, 27\n, 32 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 416; Lykins v. McGrath, \n184 \nU.S. 169, 171\n, 172 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 450.\n The lease received the approval which gave it complete validity, some time before the first of the leases made by the heirs to Williams. And Williams was charged with notice of the prior grant, because, under the provision of the Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285 (34 Stat. 1015, 1026), 'The filing heretofore or hereafter of any lease in the office of the United States Indian agent, Union Agency, Muskogee, Indian Territory, shall be deemed constructive notice,' the lodging of the prior lease with that officer in January, 1915, for transmission to the Secretary of the Interior, constituted notice to all parties thereafter claiming under her or her heirs. We agree that this provision was neither repealed nor superseded by the admis sion \n\n[256 U.S. 519, 523]\n\u00a0\n of the state of Oklahoma into the Union, or by the provisions of the Enabling Act, or the Constitution of the state which became effective November 16, 1907. As the Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out (257 Fed. 282, 168 C. C. 361), section 1 of the Enabling Act (Act June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 267) contained a proviso:\n'That nothing contained in the said Constitution shall be construed to limit or impair the rights of person or property pertaining to the Indians ... or to limit or affect the authority of the government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this act had never been passed.'\n\n While section 21 of the same act (34 Stat. 277), and section 2 of the Schedule to the Constitution of Oklahoma (Rev. Laws Oklahoma 1910, p. cxcix), contained provisions to the effect that laws in force in the territory of Oklahoma at the time of the admission of the state not repugnant to its Constitution and not locally inapplicable should be extended to and remain in force throughout the state, there was nothing to show an intent to repeal or supersede the provision of the Act of Congress of March 1, 1907, above quoted, or to establish the local recordation statutes in its place so far as related to Indian leases, such as we have here. See Exparte Webb, \n225 \nU.S. 663, 682\n, 683 S., 32 Sup.

State of Arkansas v. State of Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 158\n, sec. 4, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258.\n\n'After a study of all the evidence in the case and a careful examination of the physical facts on the ground at this time, the commissioners are unanimously of the opinion that 'Horseshoe Lake' or 'Old River' or 'Pecan Lake' was, at the time the avulsion or cut-off took place, the main navigable channel of the Mississippi river, and therefore this portion of the boundary line should follow in general the deepest water in this lake.\n\n'Leaving the west or lower end of Horseshoe Lake, the boundary line as determined by your commissioners follows, in general, the course of the present 'channel' or well-defined chute which runs in a northeasterly direction to the Mississippi river, because the evidence on the ground (namely, well-defined high banks on both sides for practically the entire distance, both of which are covered with timber of about the same age; its location west of the meander line of 1833 near the 'Horseshoe Lake' where caving would be expected, and its location east of the meander line of 1833 at a point farther north where accretion would be expected) clearly indicates that this was the last channel actually navigated by the steamboate that entered the 'Horseshoe Lake' several years after the avulsion or cut- off of 1848. \n\n[256 U.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n 'In arriving at the proper location for the line between the northeast end of 'Horseshoe Lake' and the Mississippi river at a point about one mile southwest from Friar Point, we considered the following facts and conditions:\n\n'(a) The Arkansas shore, being in a concave bend, would naturally undergo some caving or recession during the 32 years between the date of the original land survey (1816) and the date of the cut-off (1848).\n\n'(a) The 'slough' immediately east of the field in sections 10 and 15, township 4 south range 4 east, being totally devoid of short and irregular bends and following a generally uniform curve of radius similar to that of the original river in this vicinity, was, without doubt, formed by the main river, and the great difference in the age of the timber on the west bank as compared with the age of that on the east bank shows that the west bank of this 'slough' marked the most westerly limit of the main river at the time of the avulsion.\n\n'(c) The Mississippi land survey of 1835 shows that an island existed at that time near to the Mississippi shore or meander line; evidence on the ground to-day shows conclusively that this portion of the area is much older than is that part which lies farther to the west. The conformation of the old bank lines is such that accretion to the Mississippi shore in this vicinity is a logical sequence.\n\n'We have therefore decided that this line after leaving the northeast end of 'Horseshoe Lake' should gradually swing over towards the northwest and follow the general line of the 'slough,' but in front, or east, of the same, a distance which is approximately equal to that which is ordinarily found between the main bank and the line of deepest water in the Mississippi river.\n\n'After reaching a point which is opposite the upper end of this 'slough' we must, in order to reach the present river, cross over, for a distance of approximately a mile, land that has evidently been formed by the process of \n\n[256 U.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n accretion since the time of the avulsion, and hence the boundary line should be brought east, as soon as is practicable, to a point about midway between the old original meander lines, and thence along this mid-line to the Mississippi river.

CITY OF DALLAS(1921)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Decided Feb. 28, 1921. \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Marion Etheridge, of Dallas, Tex., for appellants.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas J. Freeman, of New Orleans, La., and James J. Collins, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1872 the Texas & Pacific Railway Company built its single track main line to the west on a street in the village of Dallas, then as now called Pacific avenue. In 1890 the city granted to the company a 50-year franchise to double-track its railroad on that street. In the latter year the population of Dallas was 35,057; now it is 158,976;1 and the existence and operation of the rail \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n road on the avenue has become a serious menace to life and limb, a great inconvenience to the whole people, burdensome to the railway, and an injury to neighboring property. North of the avenue lie largely the residential sections of the city; adjacent and to the south, largely business sections. A part of the avenue is in the heart of the city. There six of the leading business streets-great thoroughfares-cross it; and on two of them street cars cross the railroad at grade. Two other much traveled streets are parallel. One of these, which is only two hundred feet distant, is the principal business street of the city. The number of trains operated daily over the avenue had risen in 1918 to more than one hundred; and there were, in addition, switching operations to many neighboring industries. Trains are now longer-some of them consisting of 80 freight cars; and they occasion serious interruption to street traffic. The necessary use of larger engines, due partly to a heavy grade, results in much noise, smoke and cinders. Regulations concerning operation of trains imposed by the city in the interests of safety were necessarily severe; and had proved expensive and embarrassing to the railway. Still further safeguards and restrictions upon operation appeared to be necessary. Plans were proposed for putting the tracks in subways, for elevating them and for eliminating the grade crossings; all of which the city confessedly had power to require of the railway. But none of these projects appeared to offer a satisfactory solution of the problem. Finally a plan was worked out for the removal of the tracks from this part of the avenue for a distance of nearly a mile and for diverting the trains to the line of another railroad with which it was proposed to make connections. This involved establishing a wholesale trade district elsewhere.\n This plan proved acceptable to the railway, its receiver, the city and most of the real estate owners affected. In order to carry out the plan the Wholesale District Track \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n age Company was organized; and this corporation, the city, the railway and its receiver entered into a contract under which the improvement was to be made. Then Armour & Co., owner of a plant served by a switch track connecting with the main line on the avenue, and its lessee, brought this suit in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas against all the parties to the contract seeking to enjoin its performance and specifically the removal from Pacific avenue of the tracks which connected with their switch track. Jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked on the ground that the action proposed would deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law and impair the obligation of their contracts in violation of the federal Constitution. After full hearing on the merits a decree was entered dismissing the bill with costs. The case comes here by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n First. The basis of the plaintiffs' principal claim is this: In 1912 Armour & Co., being desirous of erecting a plant in Dallas, made a contract for the purchase of a lot on the avenue, the purchase to be conditioned upon the railway securing from the city a franchise to lay a switch connecting the lot with its main track on the avenue and upon Armour & Co. then securing from the railway an agreement to build and maintain the switch. Upon satisfying itself through negotiation with officials of the city and of the railway that these conditions would be complied with, Armour & Co. completed the purchase of the lot. The city then passed an ordinance granting such a franchise to the railway for the period of 20 years, conditioned, among other things, upon Armour & Co. dedicating about 90 square feet of their land to the public to round the two corners of their lot. The small parcels were dedicated; the plant was erected; the switch was built by the railway; and over the switch Armour & Co.'s lessee customarily receives \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n about 600 cars of freight a year. The plaintiffs contend that the switch franchise, granted by the city to the railway, was entered into for Armour & Co.'s benefit; that it was, in effect, a contract with them; that the city and the railway are powerless under the federal Constitution to abrogate that contract, either directly by surrendering the switch franchise or indirectly by removing the main track with which the switch connects; and that the plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction, because the plant, which cost nearly $80,000 to build, would lose most of its value if deprived of its rail connection.\n To this claim several answers are made. (1) That the city did not make any contract with Armour & Co. and under its charter would have been without power to do so; (2) that the railway did not make any contract with Armour & Co. to maintain the side track and that it had been authorized to remove the tracks from Pacific avenue by the Railroad Commission, under appropriate legislation, on the ground that it would 'serve the public interests by promoting the public safety and convenience'; (3) that the plaintiffs have already sought and been denied, as against the railway and its receivers, the same relief here applied for; having intervened for that purpose in the original suit brought for appointment of the receiver in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Louisiana; that the decree of the District Court therein dismissing its petition asking the same relief had been affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Armour & Co. v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., 258 Fed. 185, 169 C. C. A. 253; and that this court had denied Armour & Co.'s petition for writ of certiorari, \n251 U.S. 551\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 56; (4) that even if the franchise had purported to grant an absolute right to maintain the tracks of Pacific avenue it would have been subject to the fair exercise by the state, through the municipality as its agent, of the police power to promote the public safety; and that, under \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n the circumstances, removal of the tracks was essential for this purpose since the tracks could not appropriately be placed under ground or be elevated. See Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Co. v. Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 244\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 450; Erie Railroad Co. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners et al., \n254 U.S. 394\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 169, 65 L. Ed. --, decided by this court January 3, 1921; (5) that the franchise for the switch was not absolute; that power of revocation had been expressly reserved by clauses in the ordinance which made the franchise subject to the city's charter powers and provided 'that in the event the said railway company shall be required to abandon, to elevate or to place in subways said main tracks on Pacific avenue, the franchise should be subject thereto,' and that the railway was so required; (6) that, even if plaintiffs had the legal right which they assert, they were not entitled to relief in equity by injunction, since an action at law would afford an adequate remedy and an injunction would interfere with a paramount public interest.\n It was on the last of these grounds that the Circuit Court of Appeals in Armour & Co. v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. et al., 258 Fed. 185, 169 C. C. A. 253, unanimously affirmed the decree dismissing the intervening petition. Among the judges sitting upon appeal in that case was the Circuit Judge who entered the decree in this case here under review. He does not appear to have written an opinion in this case but presumably he dismissed this bill also on that ground. For it is clear that the case is not one for equitable relief. If the plaintiffs as abutting property owners have any legal right which is interfered with, an action at law for damages will afford them a full and complete remedy. See Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Marshall, \n136 \nU.S. 393, 405\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 846; Beasley v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n191 \nU.S. 492, 496\n, 497 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 164. We have no occasion, therefore, to consider any of the other reasons urged for affirming the decree.\n Second. Plaintiffs urge, apparently as taxpayers, this additional ground for relief: They allege that the contract \n\n[255 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n entered into by the city is void and that its performance should be enjoined; because the contract therefor was not countersigned by the auditor and the expense thereof was not charged to the proper appropriation as required by the city's charter. It was agreed that the plaintiffs had brought a suit on this ground in a state court on behalf of themselves and of other taxpayers of Dallas against the city and others, that it had obtained upon an ex parte hearing a temporary injunction restraining the city from carrying out the contract, that this suit was pending on appeal before the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas when this case was heard below, and that the temporary injunction, so far as appears, is still in force. The District Court was clearly right, under the circumstances, in refusing to grant an injunction on this ground.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 12th Census, vol. 1, p. 430; U. S.

U S(1921)\nNo. 256\nArgued: Decided: April 18, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Alexander Britton, of Washington, D. C., Gardiner Lathrop, of Chicago, Ill., and Evans Browne, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On several occasions in 1914 and 1915 the railway company at the request of the United States furnished \n\n[256 U.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n transportation from one state to another for officers and enlisted men in the United States Army. In each instance a through individual rate from the initial point to the destination was in force, and also individual rates to and from intermediate points. In no instance was there a through party rate; but in all there was a party rate for a part only of the distance. This situation was shown in schedules regularly filed and posted under the Interstate Commerce Act. In two instances the transportation was furnished under a contract calling for a special reduced rate for the full trip, and in the others it was furnished without any prior contract or special arrangement. Bills for the transportation-computed in the two instances at the contract rate, and in the others at the through individual rate with appropriate land grant deductions-were presented to the accounting officers, who allowed a part of what was claimed in each bill and disallowed the balance. The company then brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the part disallowed and the court, without opinion, sustained the action of the accounting officers.\n As to the transportation furnished without a prior contract or special arrangement the accounting officers proceeded on the theory that the collectible rate should be determined by combining the party rate covering a part only of the distance and the individual rate for the remainder and then making any necessary land grant deductions, and not by taking the through individual rate, less any deductions arising from land grants, as claimed by the company. In this we think the accounting officers erred. The service requested and rendered was a through service. The only rate applicable to a like service for others was the through individual rate. By requesting and accepting the service without some special arrangement for a different rate the United States assented to and became obligated to pay that rate. Under a provision \n\n[256 U.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n in the Interstate Commerce Act the United States could have arranged with the company for a different and reduced rate, if the company was so disposed (chapter 382,  9, 25 Stat. 862 [Comp. St.  8595]); but that was not done. In the absence of such an arrangement, the company's duty to the United States was merely that of serving it at rates no higher than those applied to individuals for like transportation (chapter 278,  5, 14 Stat. 295), less any lawful land grant deduction. No individual could require that the party rate covering a part only of the distance and the individual rate for the remainder be taken as the through rate, or as the lawful rate for a through service. Neither could the United States do so in the absence of some prior arrangement to that effect. The situation as respects individuals is aptly stated in Conference Ruling No. 268 of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\n'The tariffs of certain carriers provide a 10-party fare from A to B, but no such fare from party fare from A to B, but no such fare from B to C. Upon inquiry whether it would be legal to ticket a party of 10 from A to C on the basis of the party fare from A to B and the individual fares from B to C, when such combination makes less than the joint through individual fare from A to C: Held, that while a party of 10 acting on their own initiative would have the right to use the party fare from A to B, and to purchase such transportation as is available from B to C, the carriers may not ticket them through from A to C on such a combination, and thus defeat their own published through fare.'\n\n The contract under which some of the transportation was furnished called for a rate of $12.80 per man for the full trip, unless that rate should be found to be in excess of the 'regular tariff rate,' less land grant deductions, in which event the 'lower rate' was to govern. The accounting officers proceeded on the theory that the regular tariff rate was to be determined by combining the party rate covering a part only of the distance and the individual \n\n[256 U.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n rate for the remainder; and, finding that the rate so constructed, less a land grant deduction, was lower than the contract rate, they rejected the latter and gave effect to the new rate which they had constructed. They proceeded on a mistaken theory. The through individual rate was the only regular tariff rate which was applicable. It, less any land grant deduction, should have been compared with the contract rate ($12.80) and whichever was lower should have been treated as controlling.\n The findings relating to the transportation under the contract do not show what the through individual rate was, and therefore the suit cannot be finally determined here.\n The judgment is accordingly reversed and the suit is remanded to the Court of Claims with directions to re-examine the company's claim and award a judgment conforming to the views herein expressed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATWATER v. GUERNSEY(1921)\nNo. 511\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Abram J. Rose, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. R. Dulany Whiting, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order expunging a claim of the petitioner, Edward Atwater, against his son, Eliot Atwater, a member of the firm of Atwater, Foote and Sherill, adjudicated bankrupts. The claim is for $75, 000 furnished by the father to the son, to enable him to buy a seat in the New York Stock Exchange and to pay his initiation fee. The seat was bought and the use of it was \n\n[254 U.S. 423, 424]\n\u00a0\n contributed to the firm by Eliot Atwater, the seat remaining his individual property, as the Master and both Courts have found, and as we see no reason to doubt. In connection with the purchase, as required by the rules of the Stock Exchange, Edward Atwater executed a release of all claims against Eliot Atwater, 'and more particularly by reason of an advance of the sum of ($73,000) Seventy-Three Thousand Dollars, made to said Eliot Atwater, to enable him, the said Eliot Atwater, to purchase a membership in the New York Stock Exchange.' There was a second release with a similar special clause covering $2,010, to enable the son 'to pay his initiation fee to the New York Stock Exchange.' The Master and both Courts considered the release a bar to the appellant's claim.\n It hardly was necessary to reach that point, as it seems to us obvious that whatever moral obligation was considered to remain, both father and son understood at the time of the transaction that no legal obligation arose from the advance, and the release expressed the fact. There is no doubt that the release was intended to be an operative instrument, at least so far as creditors who were members of the Stock Exchange were concerned. That being so it would be going very far to allow a cotemporaneous parol understanding to be shown that it should not do the very thing that on its face it specifically purported to effect. But we find no such understanding. It is admitted that no document ever was given to show it. The father testified that his son never agreed to repay the money and that nothing was said about repayment; the son testified that he understood that there was no claim against himself legally. It is true, no doubt, and natural that he should have considered that there was a moral obligation, and in pursuance of it interest was paid to the father until the bankruptcy. It is true, also, that father and son in their testimony use some phrases that favored the present claim. But we are satisfied that, \n\n[254 U.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n at the time, the release was given in good faith, and meant what it said without equivocation or reserves. It is unnecessary to consider whether the Circuit Court of Appeals were successful in distinguishing Sterling v. Chapin, 185 N. Y. 395, 78 N. E. 158, from the present case, on the assumption that the parties attempted to qualify the release. More need not be said to show that the decree should be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAENDER v. BARNETT(1921)\nNo. 614\nArgued: January 11, 1921Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Levi Cooke, of Washington D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner was indicted under \n\n[255 U.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n section 169 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10339), which declares that 'whoever, without lawful authority, shall have in his possession' any die in the likeness or similitude of a die designated for making genuine coin of the United States shall be punished, etc. The indictment charged that he 'willfully, knowingly,' and without lawful authority had in his possession certain dies of that description. He entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine and suffer a year's imprison ment. He made an explanatory statement to the effect that the dies were in some junk he had purchased, and that he did not know at the time of their presence nor of their coming into his possession; but, so far as appears, the statement was made without his being under oath and with the purpose only of inviting a lenient sentence.\n Originally the statute contained the qualifying words 'with intent to fraudulently or unlawfully use the same' (chapter 127,  1, 26 Stat. 742), but they were eliminated when it was incorporated into the Criminal Code ( 35 Stat. 1088, 1120, c. 321,  169).\n The petitioner makes two contentions, One is that the statute is repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, in that it makes criminal a having in possession which is neither willing nor conscious. The District Court, in denying the petition, held otherwise, saying that the statute, rightly construed, means 'a willing and conscious possession,' and the court added:\n'Such is the possession intended by the indictment, and such is the possession, the petitioner having pleaded guilty to the indictment, that he must be held to have had. Otherwise he was not guilty. He might have pleaded not guilty, and upon trial shown that he did not know the dies were in his possession.'\n\n We think the court was right. The statute is not intended to include and make criminal a possession which is not conscious and willing. While its words are general, \n\n[255 U.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n they are to be taken in a reasonable sense, and not in one which works manifest injustice or infringes constitutional safeguards. In so holding we but give effect to a cardinal rule of construction recognized in repeated decisions of this and other courts. A citation of three will illustrate our view. In Margate Pier Co. v. Hannam, 3 B. & Ald. 266, 270, Abbott, C. J., quoting from Lord Coke, said:\n'Acts of Parliament are to be so construed, as no man that is innocent, or free from injury or wrong, be by a literal construction punished or endamaged.'\n\n In United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, 486 (19 L. Ed. 278), this court said:\n'All laws should receive a sensible construction. General terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence. It will always, therefore, be presumed that the Legislature intended exceptions to its language, which would avoid results of this character. The reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its letter. The common sense of man approves the judgment mentioned by Puffendorf, that the Bolognian law, which enacted 'that whoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost severity,' did not extend to the surgeon who opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street in a fit. The same common sense accepts the ruling, cited by Plowden, that the statute of 1 Edward II, which enacts that a prisoner who breaks prison shall be guilty of felony, does not extend to a prisoner who breaks out when the prison is on fire-'for he is not to be hanged because he would not stay to be burnt.\"\n\n And in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, 659 (60 L. Ed. 1061, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854) we said:\n'A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid, not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.'\n\n The other contention is that the clause in the Constitution empowering Congress 'to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of \n\n[255 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n the United States' (article 1,  8, cl. 6) is a limitation as well as a grant of power; that the act which the statute denounces is not counterfeiting, and therefore that Congress cannot provide for its punishment. The contention must be rejected. It rests on a misconception, not only of that clause, but also of the clause investing Congress with power 'to coin money' and 'regulate the value thereof.' Article 1,  8, cl. 5. Both have been considered by this court, and the purport of the decisions is (1) that Congress not only may coin money in the literal sense, but also may adopt appropriate measures, including the imposition of criminal penalties, to maintain the coin in its purity and to safeguard the public against spurious, simulated, and debased coin; and (2) that the power of Congress in that regard is in no wise limited by the clause relating to the punishment of counterfeiting. United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560, 567, 568; Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 535, 536, 544, 545. It hardly neeeds statement that in the exertion of this power the conscious and willing possession, without lawful authority, of a die in the likeness or similitude of one used or designated for making genuine coin of the United States may be made a criminal offense. If this be not a necessary, it is at least an appropriate, step in effectively suppressing and preventing the making and use of illegitimate coin.\n Final order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALDWIN CO. v. R S HOWARD CO(1921)\nNo. 113\nArgued: January 14, 1921Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 35, 36]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and John E. Cross, of Baltimore, Md., for Baldwin Co.\n Mr. Samuel S. Watson, of New York City, for R. S. Howard Co.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court. \n No. 139\n is here upon an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.\n No. 113 is an application for a writ of certiorari to review the same decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. The case is reported in 48 App. D. C. 437.\n The Commissioner of Patents refused to cancel the certificates of registration of a trade-mark consisting of the word 'Howard' registered by the Baldwin Company, October 17, 1905, and made a like ruling refusing to cancel the certificate of registration of the word 'Howard' with the initials 'V. G. P. Co.,' arranged in monogram, registered March 8, 1898, which marks were registered as trade-marks for pianos. The appeals were heard together in the District Court of Appeals upon the appeal of the Howard Company.\n Proceedings were brought in the Patent Office by the Howard Company against the Baldwin Company to \n\n[256 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n cancel the certificates of registration. It appears that a suit was begun in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York by the Baldwin Company against the Howard Company while the cancellation proceedings were pending, which resulted in a decree in favor of the Baldwin Company restraining the Howard Company from making or selling pianos bearing the word 'Howard,' but permitting it to use the marks 'R. S. Howard Company' and 'Robert S. Howard Company.' 233 Fed. 439. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 238 Fed. 154, 151 C. C. A. 230.\n The Baldwin Company filed in the Patent Office a certified copy of the record in the federal courts in New York, and in the Patent Office the Examiner of Interferences and the Commissioner of Patents, on appeal to him, held that the adjudication in the New York courts was a bar to the claim of the R. S. Howard Company to cancel the certificates of registration of the trade-mark 'Howard,' and dismissed the petition of the Howard Company; thereupon appeal was taken from the decision of the Commissioner to the Court of Appeals of the District. That court reversed the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, and directed the clerk to certify its decision as required by law.\n The application in the Patent Office to cancel the trade-marks was under section 13 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 728, which provides:\n'Sec. 13. That whenever any person shall deem himself injured by the registration of a trade-mark in the Patent Office he may at any time apply to the Commissioner of Patents to cancel the registration thereof. The Commissioner shall refer such application to the examiner in charge of interferences, who is empowered to hear and determine this question and who shall give notice thereof to the registrant. If it appear after a hearing before the \n\n[256 U.S. 35, 38]\n\u00a0\n examiner that the registrant was not entitled to the use of the mark at the date of his application for registration thereof, or that the mark is not used by the registrant, or has been abandoned, and the examiner shall so decide, the Commissioner shall cancel the registration. Appeal may be taken to the Commissioner in person from the decision of Examiner of Interferences.' Comp. St.  9498\n\n\n\n The appeal from the decision of the Commissioner to the Court of Appeals of the District was under section 9 of the act, which provides:\n'Sec. 9. That if an applicant for registration of a trade-mark, or a party to an interference as to a trade-mark, or a party who has filed opposition to the registration of a trademark, or party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark, is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, he may appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, on complying with the conditions required in case of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner by an applicant for patent, or a party to an interference as to an invention, and the same rules of practice and procedure shall govern in every stage of such proceedings, as far as the same may be applicable.' Comp. St.  9494.\n\n A motion is made to dismiss the appeal. No specific provision is made for an appeal from the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reviewing the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, but the decision is to be certified to the Commissioner to govern further proceedings in the case. Section 4914, Rev. Stats.; U. S. Comp. Stats.  9459.\n If the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is not final, then the motion to dismiss the appeal should be sustained, and we have no authority to grant a writ of certiorari. Judicial Code,  250, 251 (Comp. St.  1227, 1228).\n The nature of proceedings of the character now under consideration was considered in Frasch v. Moore, \n211 U.S. 1\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 6, in which the opinion of Chief Justice Alvey, speaking \n\n[256 U.S. 35, 39]\n\u00a0\n for the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Rousseau v. Brown, 21 App. D. C. 73, 80, explaining the nature of this statutory proceeding and affirming that it did not authorize a judgment, but only the return by the Court of Appeals of a certificate to the Commissioner of Patents, to be there entered of record to govern further proceedings in the case, was fully approved.\n In Atkins v. Moore, \n212 U.S. 285\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 390, application for registration of a trade-mark was refused by the Examiner, which action was approved by the Commissioner, and affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, an appeal and writ of error were allowed, both of which were dismissed in this court. The previous decisions of this court were reviewed by Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court, and in concluding the opinion he said:\n'In the light of the various details of the Act of February 20, 1905, and of the specific provisions of section 9, we were of opinion [ Gaines v. Knecht, \n212 U.S. 561\n] that proceedings under the act were governed by the same rules of practice and procedure as in the instance of patents, and the writ of error was accordingly dismissed. The same result must follow in the present case.\n\n'Under section 4914 of the Revised Statutes no opinion or decision of the Court of Appeals on appeal from the Commissioner precludes 'any person interested from the right to contest the validity of such patent in any court wherein the same may be called in question,' and by section 4915 a remedy by bill in equity is given where a patent is refused, and we regard these provisions as applicable in trade-mark cases under section 9 of the Act of February 20, 1905.'\n\n We are of opinion that the principle there announced controls this case. No provision is made which permits this statutory proceeding to be carried beyond the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, the decision of which court is directed to be certified to the Commissioner of Patents. It is in no sense a final \n\n[256 U.S. 35, 40]\n\u00a0\n judgment reviewable here upon writ of certiorari or appeal.\n It is true that in Estate of Beckwith v. Commissioner of Patents, \n252 U.S. 538\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 414, this court allowed a writ of certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, in an application to register a trade-mark. No question of the jurisdiction of the court was considered in that case, and an inadvertent allowance of the writ of certiorari does not establish the jurisdiction of the court. Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458, 463\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 158.\n It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, and the petition for a writ of certiorari denied.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANK OF MINDEN v.

P. Clements took out two policies upon his life with loss payable to his executors, administrators or assigns. He died in 1917 and his administratrix collected the stipulated sums amounting to $4,433.33. The succession was insolvent, and the banks sought to subject the insurance money to their claims, maintaining that if construed and applied so as to exempt such funds the act of 1914 would impair the obligations of their contracts and violate section 10, article 1, federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the state held that acceptance of the renewal notes did not operate as novations, but that the statute protected the insurance money without violating the federal Constitution since the exemption 'impaired the obligation of the pre-existing contract very slightly and remotely.' 146 La. 385, 83 South. 664.\n Section 10, article 1, of the Constitution-'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts'-has been much considered by this court and often applied to preserve the integrity of contractual obligations. \n\n[256 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n When the deceased took out the policies of insurance upon his life they became his property, subject to claims of his creditors.

It would seem difficult to substitute words which are more intelligible, or less liable to misconstruction, than those which are to be explained. A contract is an agreement in which a party undertakes to do, or not to do, a particular thing. The law binds him to perform his undertaking, and this is, of course, the obligation of his contract. ... Any law which releases a part of this obligation must, in the literal sense of the word, impair it. ... But it is not true that the parties have in view only the property in possession when the contract is formed, or that its obligation does not extend to future acquisitions. Industry, talents, and integrity constitute a fund which is as confidently trusted as property itself. Future acquisitions are, therefore, liable for contracts; and to release them from this liability impairs their obligation.'\n\n And in Planters' Bank v. Sharp, 6 How. 327, opinion by Mr. Justice Woodbury:\n'One of the tests that a contract has been impaired is that its value has by legislation been diminished. It is not, by the Constitution, to be impaired at all.

The motion was denied and upon the trial defendants were convicted and each sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. From the judgment and sentence they took \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n the case to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That court, reciting that certain questions of law under section 21 have arisen upon the affidavit and motion upon which the court is in doubt and upon which it desires the advice and instructions of this court, certifies questions of the sufficiency of the affidavit and the duty of the judge thereunder, and also certifies the affidavit and other proceedings upon such motion.\n The affidavit, omitting formal and unnecessary parts, is as follows:\n Petitioners [defendants] represent 'that they jointly and severally verily believe that his honor Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis has a personal bias and prejudice against certain of the defendants, to wit, Victor L. Berger, William F. Kruse and Adolph Germer, defendants in this cause, and impleaded with J. Louis Engdahl and Irwin St. John Tucker, defendants in this case. That the grounds for the petitioners' beliefs are the following facts: That said Adolph Germer was born in Prussia, a state or province of Germany; that Victor L. Berger was born in Rehback, Austria; that William F. Kruse is of immediate German extraction; that said Judge Landis is prejudiced and biased against said defendants because of their nativity, and in support thereof the defendants allege, that, on information and belief, on or about the 1st day of November said Judge Landis said in substance: 'If anybody has said anything worse about the Germans than I have I would like to know it so I can ust it.' And referring to a German who was charged with stating that 'Germany had money and plenty of men and wait and see what she is going to do to the United States,' Judge Landis said in substance: 'One must have a very judicial mind, indeed, not to be prejudiced against the German- Americans in this country. Their hearts are reeking with disloyalty. This defendant is the kind of a man that spreads this kind of propaganda, and it has been spread until it has affected practically all the Ger \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n mans in this country. This same kind of excuse of the defendant offering to protect the German people is the same kind of excuse offered by the pacifists in this country, who are against the United States and have the interests of the enemy at heart by defending that thing they call the Kaiser and his darling people. You are the same kind of a man that comes over to this country from Germany to get away from the Kaiser and war. You have become a citizen of this country and lived here as such, and now when this country is at war with Germany you seek to undermine the country which gave you protection. You are of the same mind that practically all the German- Americans are in this country, and you call yourselves German- Americans. Your hearts are reeking with disloyalty. I know a safe- blower, he is a friend of mine, who is making a good soldier in France. He was a bank robber for nine years, that was his business in peace time, and now he is a good soldier, and as between him and this defendant, I prefer the safeblower.'\n'These defendants further aver that they have at no time defended the Kaiser, but on the contrary they have been opposed to an autocracy in Germany and every other country; that Victor L.

Louis Engdahl disapproved the entrance of the United States into this war.\n\n'Your petitioners further aver that the defendants Tucker and Engdahl were born in the United States and were not born in enemy countries, and are not immediate descendants of persons born in enemy countries, but verily believe because they are impleaded with Berger, Kruse and Germer that they as well as Berger, Germer and Kruse cannot receive a fair and impartial trial, and that the prejudice of said Judge Landis against said \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n Berger, Germer and Kruse would prejudice the defense of said defendants Tucker and Engdahl impleaded in this case.'\n\n The affidavit was accompanied by the certificate of Seymour Stedman, attorney for defendants, that the affidavit and application were made in good faith.\n The questions certified are as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Is the aforesaid affidavit of prejudice sufficient to invoke the operation of the act which provides for the filing of affidavit of prejudice of a judge?\n\n\n (2)\n Did said Judge Landis have the lawful right to pass upon the sufficiency of the said affidavit of his prejudice, or upon any question arising out of the filing of said affidavit?\n\n\n (3)\n Upon the filing of the said affidavit of prejudice of said Judge Landis, did the said judge have lawful right and power to preside as judge on the trial of plaintiffs in error upon said indictment?\n The basis of the question is section 21, and the primary question under it is the duty and power of the judge, whether the filing of an affidavit of personal bias or prejudice compels his retirement from the case or whether he can exercise a judgment upon the facts affirmed and determine his qualification against them and the belief based upon them?\n These alternatives present the contentions in the case. Defendants contend for the first; the United States contends for the second. The assertion of defendants is that the mandate of the section is not subject to the discretion or judgment of the judge. The assertion of the United States is that the motion and its supporting affidavit, like other motions and their supporting evidence, are submitted for decision and the exercise of the judicial judgment upon them. In other words, the action of the affidavit is not 'automatic,' to quote the Solicitor General, but depends upon the substance and merit of its reasons and the truth of its facts, and upon both the judge has \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to pass. The issue is therefore precise, and while not in broad compass is practically of first impression as now presented.\n In Glasgow v. Moyer, \n225 U.S. 420\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 753, the section was referred to but not passed upon. In Ex parte American Steel Barrel Co., \n230 U.S. 35\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1007, the phase of the section presented here was not presented. There proceedings in bankruptcy had progressed to a decree of adjudication, and the judge who had conducted them was charged by certain creditors with bias and prejudice based on his rulings in the case. Such use of section 21 was disapproved. 'It was never intended,' it was said, 'to enable a discontented litigant to oust a judge because of adverse rulings made, for such rulings are reviewable otherwise, but to prevent his future action in the pending cause.' As pertinent to the comment and to the meaning of section 21, we may say, that Judge Chatfield, against whom the affidavit was directed, said that he felt that the intention of section 21 was 'to cause a transfer of the case without reference to the merits of the charge of bias,' and he did so immediately, in order, as he said, 'that the application of the creditors' might 'be considered as speedily as possible by such judge as' might 'be designated.' Another judge was designated and to restrain action by the latter and vacate the orders that he had made, and to command Judge Chatfield to resume jurisdiction, mandamus was sought. It was denied. The case establishes that the bias or prejudice which can be urged against a judge must be based upon something other than rulings in the case.\n The cases at circuit in which section 21 was considered have not much guidance. They, however, deserve attention. Ex parte N. K. Fairbank Co. (D. C.) 194 Fed. 978, may be considered as expressing power in the presiding judge to pass upon the sufficiency of the facts affirmed. In Ex parte Glasgow (D. C.) 195 Fed. 780, the question came up \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n upon an application for a writ of habeas corpus and it appeared that the affidavit of bias was not filed until after trial of the case and when the court was about to pass upon a motion in arrest of judgment and new trial. It was held that section 21 was not applicable at such stage of the proceedings. Henry v. Speer, 201 Fed. 869, 120 C. C. A. 107, was a petition for mandamus to require an affidavit of bias against District Judge Speer to be certified to the senior circuit judge that the latter might determine its sufficiency, and to restrain Judge Speer from exercising jurisdiction of the case. The writ was refused on the ground that the affidavit did not conform to section 21 in that it omitted to charge 'personal' bias, a charge of such bias, it was held, being a necessary condition. The court (Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit) by Judge Meek, said:\n'Upon the making and filing by a party of an affidavit under the provisions of section 21, of necessity there is imposed upon the judge the duty of examining the affidavit to determine whether or not it is the affidavit specified and required by the statute and to determine its legal sufficiency. If he finds it to be legally sufficient then he has no other or further duty to perform than that prescribed in section 20 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  987). He is relieved from the delicate and trying duty of deciding upon the question of his own disqualification.'\n\n This comment sustains defendants' view of section 21 and marks a distinction between determining the legal sufficiency of the affidavit and passing upon the truth of its statements, a distinction to which we shall presently advert.\n The cases (one being excepted), to the extent they go, militate against the contention of the government, and they have confirmation in the words of the section. Their declaration is that--\n'Whenever a party to any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall make and file an affidavit that the judge before whom the action or proceeding is to be tried or heard has a personal bias or prejudice \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 33]\n\u00a0\n either against him or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be designated ... to hear such matter.'\n\n There is no ambiguity in the declaration and seemingly nothing upon which construction can be exerted-nothing to qualify or temper its words or effect. It is clear in its permission and direction. It permits an affidavit of personal bias or prejudice to be filed and upon its filing, if it be accompanied by certificate of counsel, directs an immediate cessation of action by the judge whose bias or prejudice is averred, and in his stead, the designation of another judge. And there is purpose in the conjunction; its elements are complements of each other. The exclusion of one judge is emphasized by the requirement of the designation of another.\n But it is said that there is modification of the absolutism of the quoted declaration in the succeeding provision that the 'affidavit shall state the facts and reasons for the belief' of the existnece of the bias or prejudice. It is urged that the purpose of the requirement is to submit the reality and sufficiency of the facts to the judgment of the judge and their support of the averment or belief of the affiant. It is in effect urged that the requirement can have no other purpose, that it is idle else, giving an automatism to the affidavit which overrides everything. But this is a misunderstanding of the requirement. It has other and less extensive use as pointed out by Judge Meek in Henry v. Speer, supra. It is a precaution against abuse, removes the averments and belief from the irresponsibility of unsupported opinion, and adds to the certificated of counsel the supplementary aid of the penalties attached to perjury. Nor do we think that this view gives room for frivolous affidavits. Of course the reasons and facts for the belief the litigant entertains are an essential part of the affidavit, and must give fair support to the charge of a bent of mind that may prevent or im- \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 34]\n\u00a0\n pedeimpartiality of judgment. The affidavit of defendants has that character. The facts and reasons it states are not frivolous or fanciful, but substantial and formidable, and they have relation to the attitude of Judge Landis' mind toward defendants.\n It is, however, said, that the assertion and the facts are stated on information and belief and that hence the affidavit is wholly insufficient, section 21 requiring facts to be stated 'and not merely belief.' The contention is that 'the court is expected to act on the affidavit itself' and that therefore 'the act of Congress requires facts-not opinions, beliefs, rumors or gossip.' Ex parte American Steel Barrel Company, supra, is cited for the contention. We do not know what counsel means by 'opinions, beliefs, rumors or gossip.' The belief of a party the section makes of concern and if opinion be nearer to or farther from persuasion than belief, both are of influence and universally regarded as of influence in the affairs of men and determinative of their conduct, and it is not strange that section 21 should so regard them.\n We may concede that section 21 is not fulfilled by the assertion of 'rumors of gossip,' but such disparagement cannot be applied to the affidavit in this case. Its statement has definite time and place and character, and the value of averments on information and belief in the procedure of the law is recognized. To refuse their application to section 21 would be arbitrary and make its remedy unavailable in many, if not in most cases. The section permits only the affidavit of a party, and Ex parte American Steel Barrel Co., supra, decides, that it must be based upon facts antedating the trial, not those occurring during the trial. In the present case the information was of a definite incident, and its time and place were given. Besides, it cannot be the assumption of section 21 that the bias or prejudice of a judge in a particular case would be known by everybody, and necessarily, therefore, to deny to a party \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 35]\n\u00a0\n the use of information received from others is to deny to him at times the benefit of the section.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that an affidavit upon information and belief satisfies the section and that upon its filing, if it show the objectionable inclination or disposition of the judge, which we have said is an essential condition, it is his duty to 'proceed no further' in the case. And in this there is no serious detriment to the administration of justice nor inconvenience worth of mention, for of what concern is it to a judge to preside in a particular case; of what concern to other parties to have him so preside, and any serious delay of trial is avoided by the requirement that the affidavit must be filed not less than ten days before the commencement of the term.\n Our interpretation of section 21 has therefore no deterring consequences, and we cannot relieve from its imperative conditions upon a dread or prophecy that they may be abusively used. They can only be so used by making a false affidavit, and a charge of and the penalties of perjury restrain from that-perjury in him who makes the affidavit; connivance therein of counsel, thereby subjecting him to disbarment. And upon what inducement and for what achievement-no other than trying the case by one judge rather than another, neither party or counsel having voice or influence in the designation of that other; and the section in its care permits but 'one such affidavit.'\n But if we concede, out of deference to judgments that we respect, a foundation for the dread, a possibility to the prophecy, we must conclude Congress was aware of them and considered that there were countervailing benefits. At any rate we can only deal with it as it is expressed and enforce it according to its expressions. Nor is it our function to approve or disapprove it, but, we may say, that its solicitude is that the tribunals of the \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 36]\n\u00a0\n country shall not only be impartial in the controversies submitted to them but shall give assurance that they are impartial, free, to use the words of the section, from any 'bias or prejudice' that might disturb the normal course of impartial judgment. And to accomplish this end the section withdraws from the presiding judge a decision upon the truth of the matters alleged. Its explicit declaration is that upon the making and filing of the affidavit, the judge against whom it is directed 'shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be designated in the manner prescribed in ... section twenty-three to hear such matter.' And the reason is easy to divine. To commit to the judge a decision upon the truth of the facts gives chance for the evil against which the section is directed. The remedy by appeal is inadequate. It comes after the trial and if prejudice exist it has worked its evil and a judgment of it in a reviewing tribunal is precarious. It goes there fortified by presumptions, and nothing can be more elusive of estimate or decision than a disposition of a mind in which there is a personal ingredient.\n After overruling the motion of plaintiffs for his displacement Judge Landis permitted to be filed a stenographic report of the incident and language upon which the motion was based. We, however, have not discussed it because under our interpretation of section 21 it is excluded from consideration.\n We come then to the questions certified and to the first we answer, Yes; that is, that the affidavit of prejudice is sufficient to invoke the operation of the act. To the second we answer that to the extent we have indicated, Judge Landis had a lawful right to pass upon the sufficiency of the affidavit. To the third we answer, No; that is, that Judge Landis had no lawful right or power to preside as judge on the trial of defendants upon the indictment.\n So ordered. \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 37]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY dissenting.\n As this case is to settle the practice for this and similar cases which may arise in the federal courts, and as the opinion does not consider some aspects of the record, I venture to state the reasons which impelme to reach a different conclusion than that announced by the majority.\n An examination shows that statutes exist in a number of states covering the subject under consideration. These statutes vary in character, and in the requirements for establishing the bias or prejudice of the judge which may require him to abstain from sitting at the trial of a particular case. In some of them an affidavit of belief of prejudice, or that a fair trial cannot be had before a particular judge, is sufficient to disqualify him. Other statutes require supporting affidavits and the certificate of counsel, and provide for a hearing on the matter of disqualification. In some states the matter is required to be heard before another judge.\n The federal statute, now under consideration, had its origin in an amendment to the Judicial Code, introduced in the House of Representatives when the adoption of the Code was under consideration. As adopted in the House, the affidavit was required to set forth the reasons for the belief that personal bias or prejudice existed against the party, or in favor of the opposite party to the suit. (See Congressional Record, vol. 46, part 3, p. 2626 et seq.)\n When the bill came before the Senate, the section was amended so as to require the facts, and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice existed, to be set forth, and the affidavit is required to be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record that it and the application are made in good faith. (Senate Document, No. 848, 61st Congress, 3d Session.) It is thus apparent that the section in the form in which it finally became part of the Judicial Code intended that the bias or prejudice which should disqualify \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 38]\n\u00a0\n a judge should be personal against the objecting party, and that it should be established by an affidavit which should set forth the reasons and facts upon which the charge of bias or prejudice was based. The evident purpose of this requirement was to require a showing of such reasons and facts as would prevent imposition upon the court, and establish the propriety of the affidavit of disqualification. 'It is not sufficient,' said the late Mr. Justice Brewer, when a member of the Supreme Court of Kansas, in City of Emporia v. Volmer, 12 Kan. 627, 'that a prima facie case only be shown, such a case as would require the sustaining of a challenge to a juror. It must be strong enough to overthrow the presumption in favor of the trial judge's integrity, and of the clearness of his percentions.'\n I accept the opinion of the majority that the judge under the requirements of this statute may pass upon the sufficiency of the affidavit, subject to a review of his decision by an appellate court, and if it be sufficent to show personal bias and prejudice, the judge should not try the case. But I am unable to agree that in cases of the character now under consideration the statement of the affidavit, however unfounded, must be accepted by the judge as a sufficient reason for his disqualification, leaving the vindication of the integrity and independence of the judge to the uncertainties and inadequacy of a prosecution for perjury if it should appear that the affidavit contains known misstatements.\n Notwithstanding the filing of the affidavit purporting compliance with the statute, the court has a right to use all reasonable means to protect itself from imposition. Davis et al. v. Rivers et al., 49 Iowa, 435. The personal bias or prejudice of the judge against the defendants in this case is said to be established by language imputed to the judge as his utterance concerning the attitude of the German people during the progress of the war. \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 39]\n\u00a0\n The affidavit filed contained a statement of alleged language of the judge concerning a German who was 'charged' with making the statements set forth. Upon receiving the affidavit the judge at once inquired of counsel whether the language ascribed to him was not in fact uttered in connection with the disposition of the case of United States against one Weissensell in sentencing him after conviction by a jury of a violation of the Espionage Act in the same court. Counsel informed the judge that such was the fact. The judge asked counsel for Berger whether he had made any effort to ascertain the accuracy of the statement alleged to have been made by the court. Counsel replied that he had not. It would seem incredible that any judge could have made such statements concerning a defendant not yet tried in his court, in advance of trial and upon a mere charge of an offense. Counsel in open court admitted that the offending language was used in passing sentence after conviction in Weissensell's Case.\n Moreover, upon the affidavit being filed, and after this admission of counsel, the district attorney offered in evidence a transcript of what took place and what was in fact said upon the sentencing of Weissensell. The judge permitted this stenographic report, sworn to by an experience stenographer, who made it, to be a true and correct report of the statements made and the proceedings had, to be put into the record, saying that the truth should be shown of record in connection with the falsity, although he was of opinion that the facts stated in the affidavit failed to establish bias or prejudice against the defendants which would disqualify him from sitting at the trial.\n This stenographic report, sent up with the certificate and made part of it, and which there is no reason to believe fails to state accurately what took place, is in marked contrast with statements of the affidavit which the defendants made when seeking the disqualification of the \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 40]\n\u00a0\n judge. It shows, as we have already stated, that the utterances of the judge were after conviction of Weissensell, and were made when he was passing sentence. It shows that the statement of the judge concerning German-Americans was quite different from that stated in the affidavit, and referred to the bype of man who had been convicted and was before him for sentence. The judge in speaking of the convicted defendant said that he was of the type of man who branded almost the whole American-German population, and that one German-American, such as the defendant, talking such stuff, did more damage to his people than thousands of them could overcome by being good and loyal citizens; and that he, the defendant, was an illustration of the occasional American of German birth whose conduct had done so much to damn the whole 10,000,000 in America. While this language might have been more temperate, there does not appear to be in it anything fairly establishing that the judge directed his observations at the German people in general, but rather that his remarks were aimed at one convicted, as was the defendant, of violation of law.\n As I understand the opinion of the court, notwithstanding the admissions of counsel, and the sworn stenographic report of what took place, the affidavit must be accepted, and if it discloses matters, which, if true, would tend to establish bias and prejudice, the same must be given effect and the judge be disqualified. It does not seem to me that this conclusion comports with the requirements of the statute that reasons and facts must be set forth for the consideration of the judge. It places the federal courts at the mercy of defendants who are willing to make affidavits as to what took place at previous trials in the court, which the knowledge of the judge, and the uncontradicted testimony of an official report may show to be untrue, and in many districts may greatly retard the trial of criminal causes. \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 41]\n\u00a0\n While, as I have said, in sentencing Weissensell the judge might have been more temperate in his observations, I am unable to find that the statements of the affidavit when read in connection with the admissions of counsel, and the established facts as to what took place as gathered from the stenographic report, showed such evidence of personal bias or prejudice against the defendants as required the judge upon the mere filing of this affidavit to permit its misleading statements to be placed of record, and to proceed no further with the case.\n It does not appear that the trial judge had any acquaintance with any of the defendants, only one of whom was of German birth, or that he had any such bias or prejudice against any of them as would prevent him from fairly and impartially conducting the trial. To permit an ex parte affidavit to become in effect a final adjudication of the disqualification of a judge when facts are shown, such as are here established, seems to me to be fraught with much danger to the independent discharge of duties by federal judges, and to open a door to the abuse of the privilege which is intended to be conferred by the statute in question.\n In my judgment the questions propounded, in the light of the disclosures of this record, should be answered: As to the first: That the affidavit of prejudice, when read in the light of the other disclosures in the record, was insufficient to meet the requirements of the act. As to the second: That while the judge might have called upon another judge to pass upon the sufficiency of the affidavit, he had jurisdiction to pass upon it himself if he saw fit to do so. As to the third: That the mere filing of the affidavit did not require the judge to proceed no further with the trial of the defendants upon the accusation against them.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs in this dissent. \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 42]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n I am unable to follow the reasoning of the opinion approved by the majority or to feel fairly certain of its scope and consequence. If an admitted anarchist, charged with murder, should affirm an existing prejudice against himself and specify that the judge had made certain depreciatory remarks concerning all anarchists, what would be the result? Suppose official stenographic notes or other clear evidence should demonstrate the falsity of an affidavit, would it be necessary for the judge to retire? And what should be done if dreams or visions were the basis of an alleged belief?\n The conclusion announced gives effect to the statute which seems unwarranted by its terms and beyond the probable intent of Congress. Bias and prejudice are synonymous words and denote 'an opinion or leaning adverse to anything without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge'-a state of mind. The statute relates only to adverse opinion or leaning towards an individual and has no application to the appraisement of a class; e. g., revolutionists, assassins, traitors.\n To claim personal bias without more is insufficient; 'the facts and the reasons for the belief that such bias or prejudice exists' must be set out, and plainly, I think, this must be done in order that the judge or any reviewing tribunal may determine whether they suffice to support honest belief in the disqualifying state of mind.\n Defendants' affidavit discloses no adequate ground for believing that personal feeling existed agaisnt any one of them. The indicated prejudice was towards certain malevolents from Germany, a country then engaged in hunnish warfare and notoriously encouraged by many of its natives, who unhappily, had obtained citizenship here. The words attributed to the judge (I do not credit the affidavit's accuracy) may be fairly construed as showing \n\n[255 U.S. 22, 43]\n\u00a0\n only deep detestation for all persons of German extraction who were at that time wickedly abusing privileges granted by our indulgent laws.\n Of course, no judge should preside if he entertains such actual personal prejudice towards any party and to this obvious disqualification Congress added honestly entertained belief of such prejudice when based upon fairly adequate facts and circumstances. Intense dislike of a class does not render the judge incapable of administering complete justice to one of its members. A public officer who entertained no aversion towards disloyal German immigrants during the late war was simply unfit for his place. And while 'an overspeaking judge is no welltuned cymbal,' neither is an amorphous dummy unspotted by human emotions a becoming receptacle for judicial power. It was not the purpose of Congress to empower an unscrupulous defendant seeking escape from merited punishment to remove a judge solely because he had emphatically condemned domestic enemies in time of national danger. The personal concern of the judge in matters of this kind is indeed small, but the concern of the public is very great.\n In my view the trial judge committed no error when he considered the affidavit, held it insufficient, and refused to retire. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies and whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or have forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, shall be punished . ...' \n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBETHLEHEM MOTORS CORPORATION v. FLYNT(1921)\nNo. 254\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. J. E. Alexander, of Winston-Salem, N. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. James S. Manning, Atty. Gen., and Frank Nash, Asst. Atty. Gen ., both of Raleigh, N. C., for defendant in error. \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 422]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants in error are, respectively, sheriffs of Forsyth and Guilford counties, N. C. Under the laws of the state, for the nonpayment of a license tax, the former levied on a motor truck belonging to the Bethlehem Corporation (referred to as the Pennsylvania corporation); the latter levied on a car belonging to the National Motor Car & Vehicle Corporation (referred to as the Indiana corporation). The trucks are manufactured in Pennsylvania, the cars in Indiana, and they are distributed in North Carolina and other states through W. Irving Young & Co. (referred to as the Delaware corporation), a corporation of the state of Delaware, which conducts its business in North Carolina by the Liberty Motors Corporation and the National Motors Company, these companies being corporations of North Carolina. And it is the finding or conclusion of the trial court that 'both corporations thereupon were and became the agents' of the three other corporations 'for the purpose of selling and delivering said trucks and automobiles.' They were consigned to the two latter companies and were sold direct by them from their storage warehouse, being consigned to them for that purpose and not to be used exclusively as samples or for demonstration purposes, nor used or intended to be used, simply for the purpose of soliciting orders to be filled by shipment from the place of their manufacture.\n Plaintiffs in error brought this suit in the superior court of Forsyth county to restrain the defendants in error from selling the truck and car. A preliminary restraining order was granted. It was subsequently dissolved. The order of dissolution was affirmed by the Supreme Court, thereby sustaining the license tax and the levy upon the automobiles made to enforce it. \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n A summary of the act by which a license is required is necessary. It provides in section 72 of Laws 1917, c. 231, that every manufacturer of automobiles 'engaged in the business of selling the same in this state, or every person or persons or corporation engaged in selling automobiles in this state, the manufacturer of which has not paid the license tax provided for in this section, before selling or offering for sale any such machine, shall pay to the state treasurer a tax of $500 and obtain a license for conducting such business.' The name of the machine must accompany the application for a license, which must be in writing. A licensee may employ an unlimited number of agents, but each county of the state may levy a tax on each agent. Besides some other provisions, there is one (and it is of special pertinence in the case) 'that if any officer, agent, or representative of such manufacturer shall file with the state treasurer a sworn statement showing that at least three-fourths of the entire assets of the said manufacturer of automobiles are invested' in the bonds of the state or any of its counties, cities or towns, or in property situated therein, and returned for taxation, the taxes named in the section shall be one-fifth of those named. Upon the renewal of a license that shall have been in force less than six months, a rebate of $250 is allowed on the new license.\n Two contentions are made by the plaintiffs in error:\n\n\n (1)\n That the act imposing the tax offends the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n (2)\n That the act attempts to regulate interstate commerce in contravention of the commerce clause of the Constitution (Const. art. 1,  8).\n The contentions depend upon different considerations. The basis of the first is that they, the corporations, are discriminated against; the basis of the second is that their products are. The contentions, therefore, should not be \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n confused. They fall under two heads: (1) If the Pennsylvania corporation and the Indiana corporation and the Delaware corporation are doing business in the state, and therefore within its jurisdiction, they undoubtedly can complain of a discrimination against them that is offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment. Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 415\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. (2) If, however, they are not in the state and subject to its jurisdiction, and seek to enter, the tax may be considered a condition which the statute may impose. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, and a number of subsequent cases, including Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, supra. Unless, as plaintiffs in error contend, the tax is a discrimination against their products.\n These contentions we will consider in their order, keeping them as separate as possible.\n\n\n (a)\n This court has decided too often to need citation of the cases that corporations doing business in a state and having an agent there are within the jurisdiction of the state for the purpose of suit against them, and we may assume that the principle is applicable here and that the Pennsylvania corporation, the Indiana corporation and the Delaware corporation are within the jurisdiction of the state and subject to its laws, equally with the corporations of the state. It will be observed, however, that the act under review applies to all manufacturers and persons engaged in selling automobiles in the state. The act makes no distinctions between nonresident and resident manufacturers. Wherein, then, is there discrimination? It is contended to be in the provision which reduces the tax to one-fifth of its amount-from $500 to $100-if the manufacturer of the automobiles has three-fourths of his assets invested in the bonds of the state or some of its municipalities, or in other property situated therein and returned for taxation. The provision is declared to be impossible of performance and its effect to be that a manufacturer not having such investment of property is \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n charged $500 for a license and one having such investment of property is charged only $100. And plaintiffs in error, it is asserted are necessarily in the $500 class. The contrasting assertion is that local manufacturers are in the $100 class, and that, therefore, there is illegal discrimination in their favor.\n In explicit specification of such discrimination plaintiffs in error assert that the provision as applied to them is 'contrary to all common sense,' and that the Supreme Court conceded the improbability of compliance with it by the manufacturer of another state.\n The Attorney General of the state seems to concur in the denunciation and adds to it the declaration that the insistence of the act is of an 'utterly futile project' but adds, in order to remove or palliate its discrimination, it is as 'futile' to manufacturers of the state as to manufacturers of other states, and considers it nugatory. His words are, 'From nothing, nothing can arise,' and that 'discrimination cannot be predicated upon any scheme which is not workable.' He therefore dismisses the provision as not applicable.\n May we accept his view of it, that is, regard the condition as a mere brutum fulmen, imposing no condition or burden, against the decision of the Supreme Court of the state? The court has assumed its efficacy and regarded it as a legal condition upon the Pennsylvania corporation, the Indiana corporation, and the Delaware corporation, doing business in the state. We are unable to concur in this conclusion. It is a perilous power to concede to the state, and it is immediately manifest that it can be exerted to prevent all commerce of those corporations (or other corporations) with the state except as the commerce might be through direct personal purchases and importations. In other words, the power can be exerted to exclude the products of those corporations, and every other corporation, if they have, or it has, agents in the state. \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n But if that provision can be dismissed as nugatory, as the Attorney General asserts, we encounter the alternative provision which requires the investment of a like proportion of assets of foreign manufacturers in other property in the state returned for taxation. In resistence to the assertion that the provision discriminates against nonresident manufacturers, the Attorney General contends that it is as applicable to resident manufacturers as to nonresident manufacturers, and, of course, his inference is that its condition can be performed as easily by one as by the other, and discriminates against neither.\n To this we cannot assent. The condition can be satisfied by a resident manufacturer, his factory and its products in the first instance being within the state; it cannot be satisfied by a nonresident manufacturer, his factory necessarily being in another state, some of its products only at a given time being within the state. Therefore, there is a real discrimination, and an offense against the Fourteenth Amendment, if we assume that the corporations are within the state.\n\n\n (b)\n If they are not within the state, their second contention is that the act is an attempt to regulate interstate commerce. If it have that effect it is illegal for a tax on an agent of a foreign corporation for the sale of a product is a tax on the product, and if the product be that of another state, it is a tax on commerce between the states. Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n; Darnell & Son v. Memphis, \n208 U.S. 113\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 247. This is the assertion of plaintiffs in error; defendants in error oppose a denial to the assertion and the denial is supported by the Supreme Court on the authority of Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091; Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, \n233 U.S. 304\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 493. The basis of the denial and its support by the Supreme Court is that the automobiles had passed out of interstate commerce and had reached repose in the state, and blend with the other things of the \n\n[256 U.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n state, and became subject to intrastate regulation. It is doubtful if that be a justifiable deduction from the findings of the trial court. But comment is not necessary. It is the finding of the court that the automobiles were in the hands of the agents of the consigning corporations, and therefore, a tax against them was practically a tax on their importation into the state. It is not necessary to say it would be useless to send them to the state if their sale could be prevented by a prohibitive tax or one so discriminating that it would prevent competition with the products of the state. This is the ruling of the cases which we have cited. It is especially the ruling in Darnell & Son v. Memphis, supra. The imposition of such a tax is practically the usurpation of the power of Congress over interstate commerce, and therefore illegal.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissent. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLANSET v. CARDIN(1921)\nNo. 244\nArgued: April 20, 1921Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry C. Lewis, of Washington, D. C., and Paul A. Ewert, of Joplin, Mo., for appellant.\n Mr. A. C. Wallace, of Miami, Okl., for appellees.\n Mr. Leslie C. Garnett, of Washington, D. C., for United States, by special leave. \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant brought this suit to have himself declared to be owner of an undivided one-third interest in all lands (they are described in the bill) and other property of which his wife, Fannie Crawfish Blanset, died seised or possessed, free and clear of all claims and demands of the appellees, and to declare void a will of his wife and its approval by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The basis of the bill is the contention that under the laws of Oklahoma no man and no woman while married shall bequeath more than two- thirds of his or her property away from the other and that the prohibition extends to an Indian woman's allotment, under acts of Congress, of restricted lands.\n The bill is quite involved and contains many repetitions. Its ultimate propositions may be paraphrased as follows: Appellant is a white man, and his wife, Fannie Crawfish Blanset, was an Indian woman of the Quapaw Tribe. She was an allottee of the lands herein involved which were restricted lands so called; that is, nonalienable for the period of 25 years. She made a will devising her land to appellees, they being her children or grandchildren, and bequeathed to them also all trust funds which might be held by the United States for her. The will was approved by the Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs and by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior under and in pursuance of the provisions of an Act of Congress of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 858, 859), as amended February 14, 1913 (37 Stat. 678 [Comp. St.  4228]), and filed in the office of the Secretary of the Interior, where such wills are properly and lawfully filed, and are of record.\n Congress, by the foregoing and other legislation, provided:\n'That the state laws of descent should apply to \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n Indian allotments and to interests therein, and that the Secretary of the Interior should be governed by the same,' and that 'section 8341 of the Code of Oklahoma created an indefeasible descent in favor of the husband and that the will of a wife which attempts to will away from her husband more than two-thirds of her estate is therefore void, and of no effect to the extent to which it attempts so to do, and that in such case the husband takes by descent to the same extent.'\n\n By that section appellant is made heir to property worth $40,000 of the estate of his wife, while the will gives him only $5; that the will is null and void, and that to the extent of his heirship his wife died intestate, and that he is an heir at law of one-third of her estate, that notwithstanding section 8341 each of the appellees is claiming to be the owner of a one-third undivided interest in and to all of the remaining restricted lands, inherited or otherwise, of which Fannie Crawfish Blanset died possessed and of a one-third interest to all trust funds held by the United States to her use and benefit, such claims being made under and by virtue of the will.\n There is an allegation in the bill to the effect that appellant's wife left little or no personal property except moneys held in trust for her from the sale of inherited Indian lands by the United States; that by section 8419 dower and curtesy were abolished, and by section 8418 it was provided as follows:\n'If the decedent leave a surviving husband or wife, and only one child, or the lawful issue of one child [the estate must be distributed], in equal shares to the surviving husband, or wife and child, or issue of such child. If the decedent leave a surviving husband or wife, and more than one child living, or one child living and the lawful issue of one or more deceased children, one-third to the surviving husband or wife, and the remainder in equal shares to his children, and to the lawful issue of any deceased child, by right of representation.'\n\n And by \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n section 6328 it is provided:\n'Upon the death of either husband or wife, the survivor may continue to possess and occupy the whole homestead, which shall not in any event be subject to administration proceedings, until it is otherwise disposed of according to law; and upon the death of both husband and wife the children may continue to possess and occupy the whole homestead until the youngest child becomes of age.'\n\n It is alleged:\n'That section 1 of the Act of June 25, 1910 [Comp. St.  4226], of which the Act of February 14, 1913, is amendatory, is as follows: 'That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee-simple patent, without having made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent.\"\n\n On motion of defendants (appellees here) the bill was dismissed for want of equity. The ruling was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The case is not in broad compass and presents as its ultimate question the accordance or discordance of the laws of Congress and the laws of the state; and whether there is accordance or discordance depends upon a comparison of section 8341 of the Oklahoma Code, upon which appellant relies, and the acts of Congress referred to in the bill and what was done under them.\n That comparison we proceed to make. By section 8341 of the Code:\n'Every estate and interest in real or personal property to which heirs, husband, widow, or next of kin might succeed, may be disposed of by will: Provided, that no marriage contract in writing has been entered into between the parties; no man while married shall bequeath more than two-thirds of his property away from his wife, nor shall any woman while married be queath \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n more than two-thirds of her property away from her husband. ...'\n\n The provision of the Code is determinative, appellant contends, because the law of 'descents and distributions' of Arkansas was made applicable to the Indian Territory May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. 94, 95), and extended in its application in 1904 (33 Stat. 573), and, while at those times 'testamentary power had not been given to restricted allottees [the property in this case was a restricted allotment and the period of restriction had not expired] of any tribe but property descended, as to all tribes, wherever located, according to the local law,' yet when Oklahoma was admitted as a state the Arkansas law was superseded by the Oklahoma Code. For this Jefferson v. Fink, \n247 U.S. 288\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 516, is adduced.\n But against the contention and conclusion the act of Congress approved February 14, 1913 (37 Stat. 678), is opposed. Section 2 of that act is as follows:\n'Sec. 2. That any persons of the age of twenty-one years having any right, title, or interest in any allotment held under trust or other patent containing restrictions on alienation or individual Indian moneys or other property held in trust by the United States shall have the right prior to the expiration of the trust or restrictive period, and before the issuance of a fee-simple patent or the removal of restrictions, to dispose of such property by will, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, however, that no will so executed shall be valid or have any force or effect unless and until it shall have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided further, that the Secretary of the Interior may approve or disapprove the will either before or after the death of the testator, and in case where a will has been approved and it is subse quently \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n discovered that there has been fraud in connection with the execution or procurement of the will the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized within one year after the death of the testator to cancel the approval of the will, and the property of the testator shall thereupon descend or be distributed in accordance with the laws of the state wherein the property is located: Provided further, that the approval of the will and the death of the testator shall not operate to terminate the trust or restrictive period, but the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, cause the lands to be sold and the money derived therefrom, or so much thereof as may be necessary, used for the benefit of the heir or heirs entitled thereto, remove the restrictions, or cause patent in fee to be issued to the devisee or devisees, and pay the moneys to the legatee or legatees either in whole or in part from time to time as he may deem advisable, or use it for their benefit: Provided also, that sections one and two of this act shall not apply to the Five Civilized Tribes or the Osage Indians.'\n\n The Secretary of the Interior made regulations which were proper to the exercise of the power conferred upon him and the execution of the act of Congress and it would seem that no comment is necessary to show that section 8341 is excluded from pertinence or operation.\n But this conclusion counsel resists. He says:\n'As long as restrictions have not been removed the allotment is subject to the plenary power of Congress,' but 'when restrictions are removed the allotment automatically becomes subject to the state law.'\n\n That is, and to make application to the pending case, at the instant his wife died, appellant became heir at law to one-third of her property under the laws of the state. Appellant's reasoning is direct and confident. By his wife's death he asserts her allotment was emancipated from government control; that under section 8341 her will was void, she there fore \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n died intestate, and he became her heir of an undivided one-third of her allotment under section 8418 set out in the bill.\n And the further contention is that section 8341 is continued because the act of Congress does not expressly provide how the land shall be devised, and because it recognizes that the state laws of descent are applicable in case the Secretary disapproves the will after the death of the testator.\n If the first contention be true, the act of Congress is reduced to impotence by its contradictions. According to the contention it permits a will and immediately provides for its defeat at the very instant it is to take effect and can only take effect. Such antithetical purpose cannot be imputed to Congress and it is repelled by the words of section 2. They not only permit a will but define its permissible extent, excluding any limitation or the intrusion of any qualification by state law. They provide that one having an interest 'in any allotment held under trust or other patent containing restrictions on alienation ... shall have the right prior to the expiration of the trust or restrictive period and before the issuance of a fee simple patent or the removal of restrictions to dispose of such property (italics ours) by will in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.' And it is further provided 'that the Secretary of the Interior may approve or disapprove the will either before or after the death of the testator' and that neither circumstance shall 'operate to terminate the trust or restrictive period, but the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, ... cause patent in fee to be issued to the devisee or devisees.'\n To the other contention (if it may be called such) the answer is that the contingency (disapproval of the will after the death of the testator) did not occur, and besides there were alternatives to the contingency irreconcilable with the disposition of the property under the state Code. \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n The act of Congress is careful of conditions. In the first instance it is concerned with testacy, that is, the existence of a will. A will existing, the allotment is disposed of by it. A will not existing-either not executed or, if executed, canceled-there is intestacy, and the state laws of descent and distribution obtain. In the present case there is a will and it is uncanceled, and therefore the contention of appellant is untenable. And it will also be observed, by recurring to the act of Congress, powers are invested in the Secretary which preclude interference or control by anybody, or right in anybody to have canceled 'the patent in fee' which is empowered 'to be issued to the devisee or devisees,' a right appellant asserts in the present case. In a word, the act of Congress is complete in its control and administration of the allotment and of all that is connected with or made necessary by it, and is antagonistic to any right or interest in the husband of an Indian woman in her allotment under the Oklahoma Code. And we agree with the Court of Appeals that the act of Congress was the prompting of prudence to 'afford needed protection to dependent and natural heirs against the waste of the estate as the result of an unfortunate marriage and enforced inheritance by state laws.' And there can be no doubt that the act was the suggestion of the Interior Department, and its construction is an assistant, if not demonstrative criterion, of the meaning and purpose of the act. Swigart v. Baker, \n229 U.S. 187\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 645; Jacobs v. Prichard, \n223 U.S. 200\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 289; United States v. Hermanos, \n209 U.S. 337\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 532. And the regulations of the department are administrative of the act and partake of its legal force.\n Our conclusion is the same as that of the Court of Appeals:\n'That it was the intention of Congress that this class of Indians should have the right to dispose of property by will under this act of Congress, free from restrictions on the part of the state as to the portions to be \n\n[256 U.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n conveyed or as to the objects of the testator's bounty, provided such wills are in accordance with the regulations and meet the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The court added that the conclusion was in accord with the views of the Supreme Court of the state, referring to Brock v. Keifer, 59 Okl. 5, 157 Pac. 88.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLOCK v. HIRSH(1921)\nNo. 640\nArgued: March 3, 1921Decided: April 18, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jesse C. Adkinds, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William G. Johnson, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n Mr. Henry H. Glassie, of Washington, D. C., for the United States, amicus curia.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 135, 153]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding brought by the defendant in error, Hirsh, to recover possession of the cellar and first floor of a building on F street in Washington which the plaintiff in error, Block, holds over after the expiration of a lease to him. Hirsh bought the building while the lease was running, and on December 15, 1919, notified Block that he should require possession on December 31 when the lease expired. Block declined to surrender the premises, relying upon the Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, Title 2-'District of Columbia Rents'; especially  109; 41 Stat. 297, 298, 301. That is also the ground of his defence in this Court, and the question is whether the statute is constitutional, or, as held by the Court of Appeals, and attempt to authorize the taking of property not for public use and without due process of law, and for this and other reasons void.\n By  109 of the act the right of a tenant to occupy any hotel ( apartment, or 'rental property,' i. e., any building \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 154]\n\u00a0\n or part thereof, other than hotel or apartment, (101,) is to continue notwithstanding the expiration of his term, at the option of the tenant, subject to regulation by the Commission appointed by the act, so long as he pays the rent and performs the conditions as fixed by the lease or as modified by the Commission. It is provided in the same section that the owner shall have the right to possession 'for actual and bona fide occupancy by himself, or his wife, children or dependents ... upon giving thirty days' notice in writing.' According to his affidavit Hirsh wanted the premises for his own use, but he did not see fit to give the thirty days' notice because he denied the validity of the act. The statute embodies a scheme or code which it is needless to set forth, but it should be stated that it ends with the declaration in section 122 that the provisions of Title 2 are made necessary by emergencies growing out of the war, resulting in rental conditions in the District dangerous to the public health and burdensome to public officers, employees and accessories, and thereby embarassing the Federal Government in the transaction of the public business. As emergency legislation the Title is to end in two years unless sooner repealed.\n No doubt it is true that a legislative declaration of facts that are material only as the ground for enacting a rule of law, for instance, that a certain use is a public one, may not be held conclusive by the Courts. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 298\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361; Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 598, 606\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008; Prentiss v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 227\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67; Producers Transportation Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 131. But a declaration by a legislature concerning public conditions that by necessity and duty it must know, is entitled at least to great respect. In this instance Congress stated a publicly notorious and almost world-wide fact. That the emergency declared by the statute did exist \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 155]\n\u00a0\n must be assumed, and the question is whether Congress was incompetent to meet it in the way in which it has been met by most of the civilized countries of the world.\n The general proposition to be maintained is that circumstances have clothed the letting of buildings in the District of Columbia with a public interest so great as to justify regulation by law. Plainly circumstances may so change in time or so differ in space as to clothe with such an interest what at other times or in other places would be a matter of purely private concern. It is enough to refer to the decisions as to insurance, in German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189; irrigation, in Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171; and mining, in Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., \n200 U.S. 527\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 301, 4 Ann. Cas. 1174. They sufficiently illustrate what hardly would be denied. They illustrate also that the use by the public generally of each specific thing affected cannot be made the test of public interest, Mt. Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co. v. Alabama Interstate Power Co., \n240 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 234, and that the public interest may extend to the use of land. They dispel the notion that what in its immediate aspect may be only a private transaction may not be raised by its class or charter to a public affair. See, also, Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 110\n, 111 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487.\n The fact that tangible property is also visible tends to give rigidity to our conception of our rights in it that we do not attach to others less concretely clothed. But the notion that the former are exempt from the legislative modification required from time to time in civilized life is contradicted not only by the doctrine of eminent domain, under which what is taken is paid for, but by that of the police power in its proper sense, under which property rights may be cut down, and to that extent taken, without pay. Under the police power the right to erect buildings in a certain quarter of a city may be limited to from eighty to one hundred feet. Welch v. \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 156]\n\u00a0\n Swasey, \n214 U.S. 91\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 567. Safe pillars may be required in coal mines. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 359. Billboards in cities may be regulated. St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, \n249 U.S. 269\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 274. Watersheds in the country may be kept clear. Perley v. North Carolina, \n249 U.S. 511\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 357. These cases are enough to establish that a public exigency will justify the legislature in restricting property rights in land to a certain extent without compensation. But if to answer one need the legislature may limit height to answer another it may limit rent. We do not perceive any reason for denying the justification held good in the foregoing cases to a law limiting the property rights now in question if the public exigency requires that. The reasons are of a different nature but they certainly are not less pressing. Congress has stated the unquestionable embarrassment of Government and danger to the public health in the existing condition of things. The space in Washington is necessarily monopolized in comparatively few hands, and letting portions of it is as much a business as any other. Housing is a necessary of life. All the elements of a public interest justifying some degree of public control are present. The only matter that seems to us open to debate is whether the statute goes too far. For just as there comes a point at which the police power ceases and leaves only that of eminent domain, it may be conceded that regulations of the present sort pressed to a certain height might amount to a taking without due process of law. Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 440.\n Perhaps it would be too strict to deal with this case as concerning only the requirement of thirty days' notice. For although the plaintiff alleged that he wanted the premises for his own use the defendant denied it and might have prevailed upon that issue under the act. The general question to which we have adverted must be decided, if not in this then in the next case, and it should \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 157]\n\u00a0\n be disposed of now. The main point against the law is that tenants are allowed to remain in possession at the same rent that they have been paying, unless modified by the Commission established by the act, and that thus the use of the land and the right of the owner to do what he will with his own and to make what contracts he pleases are cut down. But if the public interest be established the regulation of rates is one of the first forms in which it is asserted, and the validity of such regulation has been settled since Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n. It is said that a grain elevator may go out of business whereas here the use is fastened upon the land. The power to go out of business, when it exists, is an illusory answer to gas companies and waterworks, but we need not stop at that. The regulation is put and justified only as a temporary measure. See Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 345\n, 346 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024; Fort Smith & Western R. R. Co. v. Mills, \n253 U.S. 206\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 526. A limit in time, to tide over a passing trouble, well may justify a law that could not be upheld as a permanent change.\n Machinery is provided to secure to the landlord a reasonable rent. Section 106. It may be assumed that the interpretation of 'reasonable' will deprive him in part at least of the power of profiting by the sudden influx of people of Washington caused by the needs of Government and the war, and thus of a right usually incident to fortunately situated property- of a part of the value of his property as defined in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 222\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 853; Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 414\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. But while it is unjust to pursue such profits from a national misfortune with sweeping denunciations, the policy of restricting them has been embodied in taxation and is accepted. It goes little if at all farther than the restriction put upon the rights of the owner of money by the more debatable usury laws. The preference given to the tenant in possession is an almost necessary incident of the policy and is traditional in English law. If the tenant \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 158]\n\u00a0\n remained subject to the landlord's power to evict, the attempt to limit the landlord's demands would fail.\n Assuming that the end in view otherwise justified the means adopted by Congress, we have no concern of course with the question whether those means were the wisest, whether they may not cost more than they come to, or will effect the result desired. It is enough that we are not warranted in saying that legislation that has been resorted to for the same purpose all over the world, is futile or has no reasonable relation to the relief sought. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 569\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 259.\n The statute is objected to on the further ground that landlords and tenants are deprived by it of a trial by jury on the right to possession of the land. If the power of the Commission established by the statute to regulate the relation is extablished, as we think it is, by what we have said, this objection amounts to little. To regulate the relation and to decide the facts affecting it are hardly separable. While the act is in force there is little to decide except whether the rent allowed is reasonable, and upon that question the courts are given the last word. A part of the exigency is to secure a speedy and summary administration of the law and we are not prepared to say that the suspension of ordinary remedies was not a reasonable provision of a statute reasonable in its aim and intent. The plaintiff obtained a judgment on the ground that the statute was void, root and branch. That judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, dissenting.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and I dissent from the opinion \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 159]\n\u00a0\n and judgment of the court. The grounds of dissent are the explicit provisions of the Constitution of the United States; the specifications of the grounds are the irresistible deductions from those provisions and, we think, would require no expression but for the opposition of those whose judgments challenge attention.\n The national government by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, are forbidden to deprive any person of 'life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' A further provision of the Fifth Amendment is that private property cannot be taken for public use, without just compensation. And there is a special security to contracts in section 10 of article 1 in the provision that 'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts . ...' These provisions are limitations upon the national legislation, with which this case is concerned, and limitations upon state legislation with which Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman et al., \n256 U.S. 170\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 465, 65 L. Ed. --, is concerned. We shall more or less consider the cases together, as they were argued and submitted on the same day and practically depend upon the same principles, and what we say about one applies to the other.\n The statute in the present case is denominated the 'Rent Law' and its purpose is to permit a lessee to continue in possession of leased premises after the expiration of his term against the demand of his landlord, and in direct opposition to the covenants of the lease, so long as he pays the rent and performs the conditions as fixed by the lease or as modified by a commission created by the statute. This is contrary to every conception of leases that the world has ever entertained, and of the reciprocal rights and obligations of lessor and lessee.\n As already declared, the provisions of the Constitution seem so direct and definite as to need no reinforcing words and to leave no other inquiry than does the statute under \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 160]\n\u00a0\n review come within their prohibition. It is asserted, that the statute has been made necessary by the conditions resulting from the 'Imperial German war.' The thought instantly comes that the country has had other wars with resulting embarrassments, yet they did not induce the relaxation of constitutional requirements nor the exercise of arbitrary power. Constitutional restraints were increased, not diminished. However, it may be admitted that the conditions presented a problem and induced an appeal for government remedy. But we must bear in mind that the Constitution is, as we have shown, a restraint upon government, purposely provided and declared upon consideration of all the consequences of what it prohibits and permits, making the restraints upon government the rights of the governed. And this careful adjustment of power and rights makes the Constitution what it was intended to be and is, a real charter of liberty, receiving and deserving the praise that has been given it as 'the most wonderful work ever struck off at any given time by the brain and purpose of man.' And we add that more than a century of trial 'has certainly proven the sagacity of the constructors, and the stubborn strength of the fabric.'\n The 'strength of the fabric' cannot be assigned to any one provision, it is the contribution of all, and therefore it is not the expression of too much anxiety to declare that a violation of any of its prohibitions is an evil-an evil in the circumstance of violation, of greater evil because of its example and malign instruction. And against the first step to it this court has warned, expressing a maxim of experience: 'Withstand beginnings.' Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 524. Who can know to what end they will conduct?\n The facts of this litigation point the warning. Recurring to them, we may ask: Of what concern is it to the public health or the operations of the federal government as to who \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 161]\n\u00a0\n shall occupy a cellar and a room above it for business purposes in the city of Washington? (the question in this case); and why is it the solicitude of the police power of the state of New York to keep from competition an apartment in the city of New York? (the question in the other case). The answer is to supply homes to the homeless. It does not satisfy. If the statute keeps a tenant in, it keeps a tenant out; indeed, this is its assumption. Its only basis is that tenants are more numerous than landlords and that in some way this disproportion, it is assumed, makes a tyranny in the landlord, and an oppression to the tenant, notwithstanding the tenant is only required to perform a contract entered into, not under the statute, but before the statute, and that the condition is remedied by rent fixing-value adjustment-by the power of the government. And this, it is the view of the opinion, has justification because 'space in Washington is limited' and 'housing is a necessary of life.' A causative and remedial relation in the circumstances we are unable to see. We do see that the effect and evil of the statute is that it withdraws the dominion of property from its owner, superseding the contracts that he confidently made under the law then existing and subjecting them to the fiat of a subsequent law.\n If such exercise of government be legal, what exercise of government is illegal? Houses are a necessary of life but other things are as necessary. May they, too, be taken from the direction of their owners and disposed of by the government? Who supplies them, and upon what inducement? And when supplied may those who get them under promise of return, and who had no hand or expense in their supply, dictate the terms of retention or use, and be bound by no agreement concerning them?\n An affirmative answer seems to be the requirement of the decision. If the public interest may be concerned, as in the statute under review, with the control of any form \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 162]\n\u00a0\n of property, it can be concerned with the control of all forms of property. And, certainly, in the first instance, the necessity or expediency of control must be a matter of legislative judgment. But, however, not to go beyond the case-if the public interest can extend a lease it can compel a lease; the difference is only in degree and boldness. In one as much as in the other, there is a violation of the positive and absolute right of the owner of the property. And it would seem, necessarily, if either can be done, unoccupied houses or unoccupied space in occupied houses can be appropriated. The efficacy of either to afford homes for the homeless cannot be disputed. In response to an inquiry from the bench counsel replied that the experiment had been tried or was being tried in a European country. It is to be remembered, that the legality of power must be estimated not by what it will do but by what it can do.\n The prospect expands and dismays when we pass outside of considerations applicable to the local and narrow conditions in the District of Columbia. It is the assertion of the statute that the federal government is embarrassed in the transaction of its business, but, as we have said, a New York statute is submitted to us and counsel have referred to the legislation of six other states. And there is intimation in the opinion that Congress in its enactment has imitated the laws of other countries. The facts are significant and suggest the inquiry, have conditions come not only to the District of Columbia embarrassing the federal government, but to the world as well, that are not amenable to passing palliatives, and that Socialism, or some form of Socialism, is the only permanent corrective or accommodation? It is indeed strange that this court, in effect, is called upon to make way for it and, through an instrument of a Constitution based on personal rights, and the purposeful encouragement of individual incentive and energy, to declare legal a power exerted for their destruction. \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 163]\n\u00a0\n The inquiry occurs, have we come to the realization of the observation that 'War unless it be fought for liberty is the most deadly enemy of liberty.'\n But passing that, and returning to the Constitution, it will be observed, as we have said, that its words are a restraint upon power, intended as such in deliberate persuasion of its wisdom as against unrestrained freedom.\n And it is significant that it is not restraint upon a \"governing one,\" but restraint upon the people themselves, and in the persuasion, to use the words of one of the supporters of the Constitution, 'the natural order of things is for liberty to yield and for government to gain ground.' Sinister interests, its conception is, may move government to exercise; one class may become dominant over another, and against the tyranny and injustice that will result, the framers of the Constitution believed precautions were as necessary as against any other abuse of power. And so careful is it of liberty that it protects in many provisions the individual against the magistrate.\n Has it suddenly become weak-become not a restraint upon evil government, but an impediment to good government? Has it become an anachronism, and is it to become 'an archaeological relic,' no longer to be an efficient factor in affairs but something only to engage and entertain the studies of antiquarians? Is not this to be dreaded-indeed, will it not be the inevitable consequence of the decision just rendered? Let us see what it justifies, and upon what principle! But first and preliminary to that inquiry are the provisions it strikes down. We have given them, but we repeat them. By article 1 of section 10 it is provided 'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts. ...' By the Fifth Amendment no person can be deprived of property without due process of law. The prohibitions need no strengthening comment. They are as absolute as axioms. A contract existing, its obligation is impregnable. \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 164]\n\u00a0\n The elements that make a contract or its obligation we need not consider. The present case is concerned with a lease, and that a lease is a contract we do not pause to demonstrate either to lawyers or to laymen, nor that the rights of the lessor are the obligations of the lessee, and, of course, the rights of the lessee are the obligations of the lessor-the mutuality constituting the consideration of the contract-the inducement to it and its value, no less to the lessee than to the lessor.\n What were the rights and obligations in the present case and what was the right of Hirsh to control his property? Hirsh is the purchaser of a lot in the city of Washington; Block is the lessee of the lot, and he agreed that at the end of his tenancy he would surrender the premises, and this, and 'each and every one of the covenants, conditions and agreements,' he promised 'to keep and perform.' Hirsh at the end of the term demanded possession. It was refused and against this suit to recover possession there was pleaded the statute. The defense prevailed in the trial court; the statute was declared unconstitutional in the Court of Appeals. It is sustained by the decision just announced.\n It is manifest, therefore, that by the statute the government interposes with its power to annul the covenants of a contract between two of its citizens and to transfer the uses of the property of one and vest them in the other. The interposition of a commission is but a detail in the power exerted-not extenuating it in any legal sense. Indeed, intensifies its illegality, takes away the right to a jury trial from any dispute of fact.\n If such power exist what is its limit and what its consequences? And by consequences we do not mean who shall have a cellar in the city of Washington or who shall have an apartment in a million-dollar apartment house in the city of New York, but the broader consequences of unrestrained power and its exertion against property, having \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 165]\n\u00a0\n example in the present case, and likely to be applied in other cases. This is of grave concern. The security of property next to personal security against the exertions of government is of the essence of liberty. They are joined in protection, as we have shown, and both the national government ( Fifth Amendment) and the states (Fourteenth Amendment) are forbidden to deprive any person 'of life, liberty or property, without due process of law,' and the emphasis of the Fifth Amendment is that private property cannot be 'taken for public use, without just compensation.' And in recognition of the purpose to protect property and the rights of its owner from givernmental aggression, the Third Amendment provides:\n'No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.'\n\n There can be no conception of property aside from its control and use, and upon its use depends its value. Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182, 187\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 113. Protection to it has been regarded as a vital principle of republican institutions. It is next in degree to the protection of personal liberty and freedom from undue interference or molestation. Chicago, Burlington, etc., R. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 581. Our social system rests largely upon its sanctity, 'and that state or community which seeks to invade it will soon discover the error in the disaster which follows.' City of Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148, 154 (53 L. Ed. 371).\n There is not a contention made in this case that this court has not pronounced untenable. An emergency is asserted as a justification of the statute and the impairment of the contract of the lease. A like contention was rejected in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2. It is there declared (4 Wall. 120) 'that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law.' And it was said that 'the Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 166]\n\u00a0\n and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.'\n But what is the power that is put in opposition to the Constitution and supersedes its prohibitions? It is not clear from the opinion what it is. The opinion gives to the police power a certain force but its range is not defined. Circumstances, it is said, 'have clothed the letting of buildings in the District of Columbia with a public interest so great as to justify regulation by law' though at other times and places such letting may be only of private concern; and the deduction is justified, it is said, by analogy to the business of insurance, the business of irrigation and the business of mining. German Alliance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189; Clark v. Nash. \n198 U.S. 361\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171; Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., \n200 U.S. 527\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 301, 4 Ann. Cas. 1174. It is difficult to handle the cases or the assertion of what they decide. An opposing denial is only available.\n To us the difference is palpable between life insurance and the regulation of its rates by the state and the exemption of a lessee from the covenants of his lease with the approval of the state, in defiance of the rights of the lessor. And as palpably different is the use of water for mining or irrigation or manufacturing, and eminent domain exercised for the procurement of its means with the requirement of compensation, and as palpably different is eminent domain, with attendant compensation, exercised for railways and other means for the working of mines.\n And there is less analogy in laws regulating the height of buildings in business sections of a city; or the requirement of boundary pillars in coal mines to safeguard the employes of one in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water; or the regulation of billboards \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 167]\n\u00a0\n in cities on account of their menace to morality, health and decency (in what way it is not necessary to specify); or the keeping clear of watersheds to protect the water reservoirs of cities from damage or devastating fires or the peril of them, from accumulation of 'tree tops, boughs and lops' left upon the ground. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The cases and their incidents hardly need explanatory comment. They justify the prohibition of the use of property to the injury of others, a prohibition that is expressed in one of the maxims of our jurisprudence. Such use of property is, of course, within the regulating power of government. It is one of the objects of government to prevent harm by one person to another by any conduct.\n The police power has some pretense for its invocation. Regarding alone the words of its definition, it embraces power over everything under the sun, and the line that separates its legal from its illegal operation cannot be easily drawn. But it must be drawn. To borrow the illustration of another, the line that separates day from night cannot be easily discerned or traced, yet the light of day and the darkness of night are very distinct things. And as distinct in our judgment is the puissance of the Constitution over all other ordinances of power, and as distinct are the cited cases from this case, and if they can bear the extent put upon them, what extent can be put upon the case at bar or upon the limit of the principle it declares? It is based upon the insistency of the public interest and its power. As we understand, the assertion is, that legislation can regard a private transaction as a matter of public interest. It is not possible to express the possession or exercise of more unbounded or irresponsible power. It is true in mitigation of this declaration and of the alarm that it causes it is said that the regard \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 168]\n\u00a0\n is not necessarily conclusive on the courts, but 'is entitled at least, to great respect.' This is intangible to measurement or brief answer. But we need not beat about in generalities or grope in their indetermination in subtle search for a test of a legal judgment upon the conditions, or the power exerted for their relief. The 'Rent Law' is brought to particularity by the condemnation of the Constitution of the United States. Call it what you will-an exertion of police or other power-nothing can absolve it from illegality. Limiting its duration to two years certainly cannot. It is what it does that is of concern. Besides, it is not sustained as the expedient of an occasion, the insistence of an emergency, but as a power in government over property based on the decisions of this court whose extent and efficacy the opinion takes pains to set forth and illustrate. And as a power in government, if it exist at all, it is perennial and universal and can give what duration it pleases to its exercise, whether for two years or for more than two years. If it can be made to endure for two years, it can be made to endure for more. There is no other power that can pronounce the limit of its duration against the time expressed in it and its justification practically marks the doom of the judicial judgment on legislative action.\n The wonder comes to us, what will the country do with its new freedom? Contracts and the obligation of contracts are the basis of life and of all its business, and the Constitution, fortifying the conventions of honor, is their conserving power. Who can foretell the consequences of its destruction or even question of it? The case is concerned with the results of the German war and we are reminded thereby that there were contracts made by the national government in the necessity or solicitude of the conduct of the war-contracts into which patriotism eagerly entered, but, it may be, that interest was enticed by the promise of exemption \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 169]\n\u00a0\n from a burden of government. Burdens of government are of the highest public interest, and their discharge is of imperious necessity. Therefore, the provocation or temptation may come to those who feel them that the property of others (estimated in the millions, perhaps) should not have asylum from a share of the load. And what answer can be made to such demand within the principle of the case now decided? Their promises are as much within the principle as the lease of Hirsh is, for necessarily, if one contract can be disregarded in the public interest every contract can be; patriotic honor may be involved in one more than in another but degrees of honor may not be attended to-the public interest regarded as paramount. At any rate, does not the decision just delivered cause a dread of such result and take away assurance of security and value from the contracts and their evidences? And it is well to remember that other exigencies may come to the government making necessary other appeals. The government can only offer the inducement and security of its bonds, but who will take them if doubt can be thrown upon the integrity of their promises under the conception of a public interest that is superior to the Constitution of the United States?\n It comes to our recollection also that some states of the Union, in consummation of what is conceived to be a present necessity, have also entered into contracts of like kind. They, too, may come under a subsequent declaration of an imperious public interest and their promises be made subject to it.\n The prophecy is not unjustified. This court has at times been forced to declare particular state laws void for their attempted impairment of the obligation of contracts. To accusations hereafter of such an effect of a state law this decision will be opposed, and the conception of the public interest. \n\n[256 U.S. 135, 170]\n\u00a0\n Indeed, we ask, may not the state have other interests besides the nullification of contracts, and may its police power be exerted for their consummation? If not, why not? Under the decision just announced, if one provision of the Constitution may be subordinated to that power, may not other provisions be? At any rate, the case commits the country to controversies, and their decision, whether for the supremacy of the Constitution or the supremacy of the power of the states, will depend upon the uncertainty of judicial judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Welch v.

EDWARDS(1921)\nNo. 495\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by Edwards to have Bodkin declared a trustee for him of the title to a quarter section of land in California. While the land was public and subject to entry under the homestead law, Edwards, a qualified applicant, made a homestead entry of it and afterwards submitted final proofs in due course. Bodkin instituted a contest against the entry and obtained its cancellation by the Land Department. The land officers then permitted Bodkin to make a homestead entry of the tract, afterwards allowed him to relinquish that entry and make others of the same tract under soldiers' additional rights of which he was the assignee, and finally patented the tract to him. During all these proceedings Edwards actively asserted the validity of his claim, and sought to interpose it as an obstacle to passing the title to Bodkin. This suit was brought shortly after the patents issued. Apparently Edwards himself drafted the bill. The District Court dismissed it without leave to amend, and he appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, while recognizing that the bill was somewhat inartificial, held that it contained allegations which, if true, disclosed a right to the relief sought. The decree of dismissal was accordingly reversed. Edwards v. Bodkin, 249 Fed. 562, 161 C. C. A. 488. When the case got back to the District Court the form of the bill was helped by amendments, but the substance remained substantially \n\n[255 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n as before. Bodkin answered, and the issues were tried. The court found that the material allegations of the bill were true; that in the proceedings before the Land Department matters presented by Edwards which should have been considered were not considered, and that in consequence the title was passed to Bodkin when it should have gone to Edwards. A decree for the latter followed, and Bodkin appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decree, and in the course of its opinion said:\n'A careful review of the testimony assures us that all material allegations of the bill of complaint have been substantiated.' 265 Fed. 621.\n\n Bodkin then took a further appeal to this court, the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals not being final under section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120).\n The appellee, Edwards, now moves that the appeal be dismissed, or in the alternative that the decree be affirmed, under rule 6, 222 U. S. Appendix, p. 10, 32 Sup. Ct. v. The appellant, Bodkin, although served with the motion and supporting brief, has not presented any brief in opposition.\n The motion to dismiss must be denied, and the one to affirm sustained. The case as presented here turns essentially on questions of fact. Both courts below on a review of the evidence have found the facts in the same way. This court, under a settled rule, accepts such concurring findings unless clear error is shown. Page v. Rogers, \n211 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 159; Washington Securities Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 725; Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 402\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 339; National Bank of Athens v. Shackelford, \n239 U.S. 81\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 17. No such error is shown by the record before us. Besides it does not contain all the evidence that was before the courts below, a part having been omitted under the appellant's specification of what should be included. In these circumstances, to retain the case for oral argument in regular course would result in harmful delay, and serve no useful purpose.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWMAN v. CONTINENTAL OIL CO.(1921)\nNo. 695\nArgued: April 11, 1921Decided: June 6, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 642, 643]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry S. Bowman, Atty. Gen., of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles R. Brock, of Denver, Colo., and E. R. Wright, of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the Continental Oil Company against the Attorney General and certain other officials of the state of New Mexico to restrain the enforcement against the company, a distributor of and dealer in gasoline and other petroleum products in that state, of the provisions of an act of the Legislature (Laws New Mexico 1919, c. 93, p. 182) imposing an excise tax of 2 cents for each gallon of gasoline sold or used, and an annual license tax of $50 for each distributing station or place of business. The case was here before under the name of Askren, Atty. Gen., v. Continental Oil Co., \n252 U.S. 444\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 355, on review of an order of the District Court (three judges sitting) granting a temporary injunction. It is now here for review of the final decree; and, Mr. Askren's term as Attorney General having expired, Mr. Bowman, his successor in office, has been substituted as a party in his stead.\n On the former appeal it appeared upon the face of the bill that plaintiff (appellee) purchases gasoline in various states other than New Mexico and ships it into that state, there to be sold and delivered; that it carries on business in two ways: First, gasoline is brought in from other states either in tank cars, in barrels, or in packages containing not less that two five-gallon cans, and sold and delivered to customers in the original packages, in the same form and condition as when received by plaintiff in the state \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 644]\n\u00a0\n of New Mexico, as to which we held plaintiff is engaged in interstate commerce and not liable to pay to the state a license tax for purchasing, shipping, and selling gasoline in that manner; secondly, a part of plaintiff's business consists of selling gasoline from the tank cars, barrels, and packages in quantities to suit purchasers, and we held that business of this kind is properly taxable by the laws of the state, although the gasoline is brought into the state in interstate commerce; that the mere fact that it was produced in another state does not show a discrimination against the products of such state; and that sales from broken packages in quantities to suit purchasers are a subject of taxation within the legitimate power of the state. But these latter sales were little emphasized in the bill, which stressed the sales in original packages; and, since from its averments it was impossible to determine whether the sales from broken packages were of substantial importance, we did not at that stage of the case go into the question whether the act was separable, but reserved it for the final hearing, while affirming the order for a temporary injunction.\n Upon the going down of the mandate, plaintiff amended its bill by averring that in addition to carrying on the business of buying and selling gasoline and other petroleum products, it is using gasoline at each of its distributing stations within the state of New Mexico (37 in number) in the operation of its automobile tank wagons and otherwise; that under the terms of the act it is prohibited from using this gasoline except upon the payment of the excise tax of 2 cents per gallon therefor; that this is a property tax, void under section 1 of article 8 of the state Constitution because not levied in proportion to the value of the gasoline; and that the imposition of the tax denies to plaintiff the equal protection of the laws and amounts to a taking of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further is in \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 645]\n\u00a0\n violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n Defendants answered, alleging that plaintiff's sales in tank cars or other unbroken packages are insignificant as compared with its sales made after original packages have been broken; denying that the act exacts of the plaintiff payment of a license tax for the privilege of shipping or selling gasoline in interstate commerce, or of an excise tax on the gasoline sold in such commerce; averring that the state of New Mexico and its officers charged with enforcement of the law do not construe the act as affecting interstate commerce, and have no purpose or intention to enforce it so as to do so, or otherwise than so far as intrastate commerce is concerned; and averring that any gasoline used by plaintiffs at its distributing stations is no longer in interstate commerce, but has become commingled with the general mass of property in the state, and a tax upon its use is not void under the state Constitution or a violation of the commerce clause (Const. art. 1,  8), or the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The case came on for final hearing upon stipulated facts as to the course of plaintiff's business, from which it appeared that during the years 1918 and 1919 and the first seven months of 1920 its sales of gasoline in bulk or from broken packages constituted about 94.5 per cent. of its aggregate business, and sales in original barrels, packages, or tank cars without breaking the packages about 5.5 per cent., in addition to which the company consumed in the conduct of its own business gasoline equal to about 8 per cent. of its total sales. It was further stipulated that this represents the ordinary course of business of the company, but that future percentages will depend upon the demands of customers.\n The trial court, after referring to our decision in 252 U. S., proceeded to pass upon the question whether the statute is separable and capable of being sustained so far \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 646]\n\u00a0\n as it imposes a tax upon domestic business legitimately taxable. Reciting the language of the act, and reading it as including every distributor of gasoline, whether selling at retail or in original packages, as imposing an excise tax upon all gasoline, whether sold in one way or the other, and as making no exemption from either the license or the excise tax for persons selling gasoline or for gasoline sold in original packages, the court declared that it could not read an exemption into it without giving it a meaning the Legislature might never have intended, and held the act not separable, but void as to both interstate and domestic business. Having reached this conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to pass upon the question whether the imposition of an excise tax of 2 cents per gallon upon the gasoline used by plaintiff in its automobiles and trucks employed in the business of distributing its wares for sale was in violation of the provision of section 1, art. 8, of the Constitution of the state because not levied in proportion to the value of the gasoline so used.\n Assuming that, upon the question of construction, the District Court was right, and that the act manifests an intent to tax interstate as well as domestic transactions in gasoline, and is not in this respect capable of separation, still, so far as the excise tax is concerned-imposed as it is upon the sale and use of gasoline according to the number of gallons sold and used-the divisible nature of the subject renders it feasible to control the operation and effect of the tax so as to prevent it from being imposed upon sales in interstate commerce, while allowing the state to enforce it with respect to domestic transactions; and with the allowance of an injunction limited accordingly plaintiff will receive the full protection to which it is entitled under the Constitution of the United States. The applicable rule is that laid down in Ratterman v. Western Union Tel. Co., \n127 U.S. 411\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1127, where, in response to a question whether a single tax, assessed by a state upon \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 647]\n\u00a0\n the receipts of a telegraph company derived partly from interstate commerce and partly from commerce within the state, but returned and assessed in gross and without separation or apportionment, was wholly invalid or invalid only in proportion and to the extent that the receipts were derived from interstate commerce, this court unanimously answered that so far as levied upon receipts derived from interstate commerce the tax was void, but so far as levied upon receipts from commerce wholly within the state it was valid. This case has been cited repeatedly with approval and its principle accepted. W. U. Telegraph Co. v. Alabama, \n132 \nU.S. 472, 476\n, 477 S., 10 Sup. Ct. 161; Lehigh Valley R. R. v. Pennsylvania, \n145 \nU.S. 192, 200\n, 201 S., 12 Sup. Ct. 806; Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 \nU.S. 692, 697\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1094; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 31\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 190.\n But with the license tax it is otherwise. If the statute is inseparable, then both by its terms and by its legal operation and effect this tax is imposed generally upon the entire business conducted, including interstate commerce as well as domestic; and the tax is void under the authority of Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 647\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1380, Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 58\n, 59 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 851, Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 419\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 116, and other cases of that character.\n Upon the question of severability, we are constrained to concur in the view adopted by the District Court; and this notwithstanding our hesitation, in advance of a declaration by the court of last resort of the state, to adopt a construction bringing the law into conflict with the federal Constitution. Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 591\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 372; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 370 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 99. The act, in its second section, requires every distributor of gasoline to pay an annual license tax of $50 for each distributing station or place of business or agency, requires it to be paid in advance, and renders it unlawful to carry on the business without having paid it. \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 648]\n\u00a0\n Section 8 declares that any person who shall engage or continue in the business of selling gasoline without a license shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both. The subject taxed is not in its nature divisible, as in the case of the excise tax. The imposition falls upon the entire business indiscriminately; and so does the prohibition against the further conduct of business without making the payment. By accepted canons of construction, the provisions of the act in respect of this tax are not capable of separation so as to confine them to domestic trade, leaving interstate commerce exempt. United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 221; Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, 99; Poindexter v. Greenhow, \n114 \nU.S. 270, 304\n, 305 S., 5 Sup. Ct. 903, 962; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 636\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 912\n\n\n No doubt the state might impose a license tax upon the distribution and sale of gasoline in domestic commerce if it did not make its payment a condition of carrying on interstate state or foreign commerce. But the state has not done this by any act of legislation. Its executive and administrative officials have disavowed a purpose to exact payment of the license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce. But the difficulty is that, since plaintiff, so far as appears, necessarily conducts its interstate and domestic commerce in gasoline indiscriminately at the same stations and by the same agencies, the license tax cannot be enforced at all without interfering with interstate commerce unless it be enforced otherwise than as prescribed by the statute-that is to say, without authority of law. Hence it cannot be enforced at all.\n With the excise tax as imposed upon the use of gasoline by plaintiff at its distributing stations, in the operation of its automobile tank wagons and otherwise, we have no difficulty. Manifestly gasoline thus used has passed \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 649]\n\u00a0\n beyond interstate commerce, and the tax can be imposed upon its use, as well as upon the sale of the same commodity in domestic trade, without infringing plaintiff's commercial rights under the federal Constitution. Section 1, art. 8, of the state Constitution, invoked by plaintiff, reads:\n'Taxes levied upon tangible property shall be in proportion to the value thereof, and taxes shall be equal and iniform upon subjects of taxation of the same class.'\n\n Clearly the first part of this refers to property taxation. The tax imposed by the act under consideration upon the 'sale or use of all gasoline sold or used in this state' is not property taxation, but in effect, as in name, an excise tax. We see no reason to doubt the power of the state to select this commodity, as distinguished from others, in order to impose an excise tax upon its sale and use; and since the tax operates impartially upon all, and with territorial uniformity throughout the state, we deem it 'equal and uniform upon subjects of taxation of the same class,' within the meaning of section 1 of article 8.\n There is no substance in the objection that the excise tax, as applied to domestic sales and domestic use of gasoline, infringes plaintiff's rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The contention that it interferes with interstate commerce because the gasoline is the product of other states already has been disposed of.\n The decree under review should be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to grant a decree enjoining the enforcement as against plaintiff of the license tax without qualification, and of the excise tax upon the sale or sue of gasoline only with respect to sales of gasoline brought from without the state into the state of New Mexico, and there sold and delivered to customers in the original packages, whether tank cars, barrels, or other packages, and in the same form and condition as when \n\n[256 U.S. 642, 650]\n\u00a0\n received by plaintiff in that state, but without prejudice to the right of the state, through appellants or other officers, to enforce collection of the excise tax with respect to sales of gasoline from broken packages in quantities to suit purchasers, notwithstanding such gasoline may have been brought into the state in interstate commerce, and with respect to any and all gasoline used by plaintiff at its distributing stations or elsewhere in the state in the operation of its automobile tank wagons or otherwise, and without prejudice to the right of the state, through appellants or other officers, to require plaintiff to render detailed statements of all gasoline received, sold, or used by it, whether in interstate commerce or not, to the end that the state may the more readily enforce said excise tax to the extent that it has lawful power to enforce it as above stated.\n Decree reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRACHT v. SAN ANTONIO & A P R. CO.(1921)\nNo. 118\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. I. N. Watson, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., and R. J. Boyle, of San Antonio, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n June 10, 1918, the petitioner delivered to respondent railway company at Ingleside, Tax., a carload of vegetables consigned to himself at Dallas, Tex., a point off its lines, where he intended to sell them. He accepted a bill of lading upon the face of which was plainly printed: 'For use only between points within the State of Texas.' \n\n[254 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n It contained no reference to a diversion or reshipment; and the record discloses no rule or regulation by the state statutes or authorities on that subject.\n The car moved over respondent's road to Waco and then over the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway to Dallas, where it appears to have arrived promptly with contents in good condition. Upon petitioner's request, made after such arrival, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway forwarded the car to Kansas City over its own lines, took up the original bill of lading, and issued an interstate one acknowledging receipt of the vegetables at Dallas. When the car reached Kansas City the contents were in bad condition, and thereupon petitioner sued respondent as the initial carrier claiming a right to recover damages under the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (34 Stat. 584, c. 3591 [Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa]).\n The court below held that the provisions in interstate tariffs permitting reconsignment or change of destination did not apply; that the carrier only agreed to transport to Dallas and was not liable for damage sustained beyond that point.\n Respondent's contract appears to have related only to a movement between points in the same state. It had no notice or reason to suppose that the freight would pass beyond the destination specified. The original undertaking was an intrastate transaction, subject, of course, to any applicable rules and regulations prescribed by state authority. The record discloses none; and we are unable to say as a matter of federal law that the tariff schedules for interstate shipments or the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) constituted part of the agreement. The general principles announced in Gulf, Colorado & Sante Fe Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n204 \nU.S. 403, 411\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 360, are applicable. R. R. Commission of Ohio v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 653, Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 U.S. 111\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 229, and similar cases are not \n\n[254 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n controlling. They involved controversies concerning carriage between points in the same state which was really but part of an interstate or foreign movement reasonably to be anticipated by the contracting parties-a recognized step towards a destination outside the state. The distinctions are elucidated in Texas & N. O. R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. Here neither shipper nor respondent had in contemplation any movement beyond the point specified, and the contract between them must be determined from the original bill of lading and the local laws and regulations.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBREIHOLZ v. BOARD SUP'RS OF POCAHONTAS COUNTY, IOWA(1921)\nNo. 23\nArgued: October 7, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Denis M. Kelleher, of Ft. Dodge, Iowa, for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. F. C. Gilchrist, of Laurens, Iowa, and Robert Healy, of Ft. Dodge, Iowa, for defendants in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Conformably to the statutes of the state, drainage district No. 29 was organized in Pocahontas county, Iowa, in 1907, and a system of drainage, regularly planned, adopted and constructed, was completed in 1909. An assessment to pay for this improvement was imposed upon the lands within the district in proportion to the benefits which each tract would derive from it.\n Two years later, in 1911, parts of the ditches having become so filled up as to impair the usefulness of the system, the county board of supervisors adopted a resolution declaring that it was expedient that the drainage \n\n[257 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n IMPROVEMENT SHOULD BE 'REOPENED, CLEANEd and otherwise repaired' for the better service of the land tributary to it, and to that end a contract was let to 'deepen, clean, reopen and repair' the ditches in the parts and in a manner specified. An assessment to pay for this reopening, cleaning and repairing was made upon the lands in the district in the same proportion to benefits as that made to pay for the original construction, and the controversy in this case is as to the constitutionality of the statute under which this assessment was levied upon the lands of the plaintiffs in error.\n The state statutes (Supplement to the Code of Iowa 1913, c. 2a) committed to the board of supervisors of the county, the power to establish drainage districts, to adopt systems of drainage, to determine the extent of any damage which might be caused to lands thereby, and to make assessment on the lands in the district, in proportion to benefits, to pay for the improvement.\n Elaborate provision is made for notice to all owners of land within a proposed drainage district, of the application for the establishment of it, of the time for hearing claims for damages likely to be caused by the construction of the drainage system, and of the time when objections may be made to the assessment in proportion to benefits. From the determination of the board with respect to each of these a right of appeal to the state district court is given\n It is admitted that all of the requisite action was taken to establish the system of drainage involved and for making the assessment upon the benefited lands, including those of the plaintiffs in error, to pay for the original work done, and that sufficient notice thereof to satisfy all constitutional requirements was given to all concerned.\n The action in this case was taken under section 1989a21 of the Iowa Code (Supplement 1913) which provides that \n\n[257 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n after any drainage district shall have been established and the improvement constructed (as in this case):\n'... The same shall at all times be under the control and supervision of the board of supervisors, and it shall be the duty of the board to keep the same in repair and for that purpose they may cause the same to be enlarged, reopened, deepened, widened, strightened or lengthened for a better outlet. ... The cost of such repairs or change shall be paid by the board from the drainage fund of said ... drainage district, or by assessing and levying the cost of such change or repair upon the lands in the same proportion that the original expenses and cost of construction were levied and assessed, except where additional right of way is required or additional lands affected thereby, in either of which cases the board shall proceed' giving notice and hearing as is otherwise provided.\n\n It will be noted that the section thus quoted does not require that notice shall be given to landowners of such intended enlarging, reopening, etc., of the drainage system as is provided for therein, and that no provision is made for a hearing with respect thereto, at which objections may be made either to the doing of the work or to the assessment to pay for it, and the contention of the plaintiffs in error is that the failure to provide for such notice and hearing renders the section unconstitutional for the reason that if enforced it would deprive them of their property without due process of law.\n To this contention of invalidity it is replied that the section assailed is a legislative determination of the amount which should be assessed upon the lands of plaintiffs in error to pay for the preservation and repair of the drainage system, and that, therefore, due process of law did not require a new notice and opportunity to be heard before the work was determined upon or the assessment \n\n[257 U.S. 118, 123]\n\u00a0\n made-this under authority of decisions of this court, extending from Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 345\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 921, to Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182, 189\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 113.\n The Supreme Court of Iowa held the statute and assessment both valid, and a writ of error brings the case here for review.\n The contention that a new notice and hearing was not required in this case by the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment is a sound one. We are dealing with the taxing power of the state of Iowa, exerted through the familiar agency of a regularly organized drainage district, which it is admitted, properly included, and by the system of drainage adopted, benefited the lands of the plaintiffs in error. It is admitted also that their lands were lawfully assessed to pay for the original drainage construction in the same proportion to benefits as that which was applied in this case to the cost of the improvements and repairs. Thus Myles Salt Co. v. Board of Commissioners, \n239 U.S. 478\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 204, L. R. A. 1918E, 190, and Gast Realty & Investment Co. v. Schneider Granite Company, \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 254, which are much relied upon, are plainly inapplicable.\n The provision of the section assailed, that the cost of repairs shall be assessed upon the lands of the district in the same proportion that the original cost was assessed, since it only requires a simple calculation to determine the amount of each assessment when the cost of the improvement is once determined, is a legislative declaration that the lands will be benefited, and that in such case notice and hearing before such a legislative determination is not necessary, is settled by many decisions of this court, among others, Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 \nU.S. 701, 708\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 663; Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 345\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 921; Embree v. Kansas City, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 250\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 317; Wagner v. Leser, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 218 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 66, Houck v. Little River District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 265\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 58, and Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182, 189\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 113. \n\n[257 U.S. 118, 124]\n\u00a0\n The only possible source of objection remaining is the committing to the board of supervisors the power to determine, without notice and hearing, when repairs are necessary and the extent of them. But these are details of state administration with which the federal authority will not interfere, except, possibly, to prevent confiscation or spoliation of which there is no suggestion in this case. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 106, and cases cited, supra.\n The propriety of resorting to such a practice-process of law applicable to such a case-is commended to us by the comment of the Supreme Court of Iowa, in deciding this case, saying:\n'The duty [to keep the drainage system open and in repair] is one which is continuous, calling for supervision from day to day and month to month, or, in the language of the statute, 'at all times.' The work to be done may involve considerable expense, or it may be a succession of petty repairs, each of which is comparatively inexpensive. To require that in each case the board must advertise ... and seek the lowest bidder [and hold hearings with respect to it] would be to hamper and prevent its ... action without ... corresponding benefit to the public.'\n\n It is not necessary that we should consider whether a case can be imagined in which the ditches of a district might be enlarged, deepened, widened and lengthened to an extent such as to constitute a new construction and a new taking of property, which would require a further notice and hearing before a new assessment for it could be constitutionally imposed, for we have no such case here. There was some widening of the ditches for the purpose of securing a better angle of repose for the sides and some slight widening and deepening of the bottom at various points for the purpose of getting a better fall and outlet for the water, but we quite agree with the two state courts that the changes made were of a character \n\n[257 U.S. 118, 125]\n\u00a0\n and extent fairly within the scope of a cleaning, alteration and repair of the ditch system and necessary to promote its usefulness.\n While the principles of law applicable to this proceeding are well settled we have preferred to again refer thus briefly to the controlling cases rather than to dismiss the petition in error.\n It results that the motion to dismiss will be overruled and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in result. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v.

C. A. 258. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n250 U.S. 637\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 494. Two questions are raised. The first is whether the indictment is sufficient, inasmuch as it does not allege that the place of the homicide was acquired by the United States 'for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building,' although it does allege that it was acquired from the State of Texas by the United States for the exclusive use of the United States for its public purposes and was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the same. Penal Code of March 4, 1909, c. 321,  272, Third; 35 Stat. 1088 (Comp. St.  10445); \n\n[256 U.S. 335, 342]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, art. 1,  8. In view of our opinion upon the second point we think it unnecessary to do more than to refer to the discussion in the Court below upon this.\n The other question concerns the instructions at the trial. There had been trouble between Hermis and the defendant for a long time. There was evidence that Hermis had twice assaulted the defendant with a knife and had made threats communicated to the defendant that the next time, one of them would go off in a black box. On the day in question the defendant was at the place above mentioned superintending excavation work for a postoffice. In view of Hermis's threats he had taken a pistol with him and had laid it in his coat upon a dump. Hermis was driven up by a witness, in a cart to be loaded, and the defendant said that certain earth was not to be removed, whereupon Hermis came toward him, the defendant says, with a knife. The defendant retreated some twenty or twenty-five feet to where his coat was and got his pistol. Hermis was striking at him and the defendant fired four shots and killed him. The judge instructed the jury among other things that 'it is necessary to remember, in considering the question of self defence, that the party assaulted is always under the obligation to retreat so long as retreat is open to him, provided that he can do so without subjecting himself to the danger of death or great bodily harm.' The instruction was reinforced by the further intimation that unless 'retreat would have appeared to a man of reasonable prudence, in the position of the defendant, as involving danger of death or serious bodily harm' the defendant was not entitled to stand his ground. An instruction to the effect that if the defendant had reasonable grounds of apprehension that he was in danger of losing his life or of suffering serious bodily harm from Hermis he was not bound to retreat was refused. So the question is brought out with sufficient clearness whether the formula \n\n[256 U.S. 335, 343]\n\u00a0\n laid down by the Court and often repeated by the ancient law is adequate to the protection of the defendant's rights.\n It is useless to go into the developments of the law from the time when a man who had killed another no matter how innocently had to get his pardon, whether of grace or of course. Concrete cases or illustrations stated in the early law in conditions very different from the present, like the reference to retreat in Coke, Third Inst. 55, and elsewhere, have had a tendency to ossify into specific rules without much regard for reason. Other examples may be found in the law as to trespass ab initio, Commonwealth v. Rubin, 165 Mass. 453, 43 N. E. 200, and as to fresh complaint after rape. Commonwealth v. Cleary, 172 Mass. 175, 51 N. E. 746. Rationally the failure to retreat is a circumstance to be considered with all the others in order to determine whether the defendant went farther than he was justified in doing; not a categorical proof of guilt. The law has grown, and even if historical mistakes have contributed to its growth it has tended in the direction of rules consistent with human nature. Many respectable writers agree that if a man reasonably believes that he is in immediate danger of death or grievous bodily harm from his assailant he may stand his ground and that if he kills him he has not succeeded the bounds of lawful self defence. That has been the decision of this Court. Beard v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 550, 559\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 962. Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife. Therefore in this Court, at least, it is not a condition of immunity that one in that situation should pause to consider whether a reasonable man might not think it possible to fly with safety or to disable his assailant rather than to kill him Rowe v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 546, 558\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 172. The law of Texas very strongly adopts these views as is shown by many cases, of which it is enough to cite two. Cooper v. State, 49 Tex. Cr. R. 28, 38, 89 S. W. 1068. Baltrip v. State, 30 Tex. App. 545, 549, 17 S. W. 1106. \n\n[256 U.S. 335, 344]\n\u00a0\n It is true that in the case of Beard he was upon his own land (not in his house,) and in that of Rowe he was in the room of a hotel, but those facts, although mentioned by the Court, would not have bettered the defence by the old common law and were not appreciably more favorable than that the defendant here was at a place where he was called to be, in the discharge of his duty. There was evidence that the last shot was fired after Hermis was down. The jury might not believe the defendant's testimony that it was an accidental discharge, but the suggestion of the Government that this Court may disregard the considerable body of evidence that the shooting was in self defence is based upon a misunderstanding of what was meant by some language in Battle v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 36, 38\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 422. Moreover if the last shot was intentional and may seem to have been unnecessary when considered in cold blood, the defendant would not necessarily lose his immunity if it followed close upon the others while the heat of the conflict was on, and if the defendant believed that he was fighting for his life.\n The Government presents a different case. It denies that Hermis had a knife and even that Brown was acting in self defence. Not-withstanding the repeated threats of Hermis and intimations that one of the two would die at the next encounter, which seem hardly to be denied, of course it was possible for the jury to find that Brown had not sufficient reason to think that his life was in danger at that time, that he exceeded the limits of reasonable self defence or even that he was the attacking party. But upon the hypothesis to which the evidence gave much color, that Hermis began the attack, the instruction struction that we have stated was wrong.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBULLOCK v.

The Supreme Court of Florida granted the prohibition, State v. Bullock, 82 South. 866, 8 A. L.

Before the present bill for foreclosure was filed the Railroad Company had applied to the Railroad Commission for leave to cease operations had been refused, and the State, by the Railroad Commission, had obtained an injunction forbidding the dismantling of the road and requiring it to go on. It ceased operations however on December 7, 1917. On December 10, 1917, the bill to foreclose was filed. On the same day the State filed a bill in the same Court, ancillary to its other bill, asking for a receiver to operate the road until further order, and a few days later sought to have its bill consolidated with the foreclosure suit. This was denied and the State's bill was dismissed. The decree of foreclosure complained of was entered on December 24, 1917, but on January 22, 1918, in deference to the State's contention that the road could be run at a profit, although the State had not been admitted formally as a party, H. S. Cummings was appointed a receiver, he being the most available man and being able by his connections to give the road a good deal of business in the way of carrying lumber. After nearly a year's trial the Court was satisfied that the road could not go on and thereupon ordered a sale which was made on February 3, 1919. On March 27, 1919, the Court admitted the State as a party and informed counsel that if it turned out as the Receiver and State insisted, 'that the road was operating so as to pay expenses of operation and the taxes and had some reasonable show for business the sale would not be confirmed.' On May 5, 1919, the Court entered an order finding that the road was hopelessly insolvent and could not be operated so as to have any net income whatever but postponing confirmation of the sale until May 12, before which time the proceedings for prohibition were begun. \n\n[254 U.S. 513, 520]\n\u00a0\n The foreclosure decree of December 24, 1917, provided for a first offer of the road to be used as a common carrier, but if less than $200, 000 was bid, there was to be a second offer with the privilege of dismantling. If, however, the bid on the second offer did not exceed by $ 100,000 the bid under the first offer, if there was one, the bid under the first offer was to be accepted. The trustee for bondholders was authorized to use the indebtedness of the company in bidding and to apply his bid, if accepted, to the same. There was no bid on the first offer and the Assets Realization Company bought the property under the second. The prohibition is against confirming the sale and against so much of the foreclosure decree as authorized the second offer or dismantling the road. The ground of decision was that in the absence of statute a railroad company has no right to divert its property to other uses without the consent of the State and that the lower Court had no jurisdiction to make the prohibited portion of the decree in a proceeding to which the State was not a party until after the decree had been made.\n It is not questioned that the lower Court had jurisdiction of the foreclosure and it is not suggested that any statute forbids the decree that was made. The decision of the Court proceeds upon a doctrine as to the duty of the railroad company, again a duty not based upon statute, and although stated in terms of jurisdiction, depends entirely upon a determination of what the rights of the company are. If the company had the right to stop its operations and dismantle its road we do not understand that it is doubted that the decree might embody that right in its order of sale. If we are correct, the word 'jurisdiction' must not prevent a further consideration of the case. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the World, Loyal Order of Moose, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 414\n, 415 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 371.\n Apart from statute or express contract people who have put their money into a railroad are not bound to go on \n\n[254 U.S. 513, 521]\n\u00a0\n with it at a loss if there is no reasonable prospect of profitable operation in the future. Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183. No implied contract that they will do so can be elicited from the mere fact that they have accepted a charter from the State and have been allowed to exercise the power of eminent domain. Suppose that a railroad company should find that its road was a failure, it could not make the State a party to a proceeding for leave to stop, and whether the State would proceed would be for the State to decide. The only remedy of the company would be to stop, and that it would have a right to do without the consent of the State if the facts were as supposed. Purchasers of the road by foreclosure would have the same right.\n But the foreclosure was not a proceeding in rem and could confer no rights except those existing in the mortgagor. A purchaser at the sale would acquire all such rights as the mortgagor had to stop operations, whatever words were used in the decree, and, whatever the words, would get no more. The prohibition excluding from the decree the words purporting to authorize dismantling the road did not cut down the future purchaser's rights, any more than did the presence of those words enlarge them. Therefore the action of the Supreme Court is not open to objection under the Constitution of the United States, although it may be that it hardly would have been taken if the authority to dismantle had not sounded more absolute than it could be in fact, considering the nature of the proceeding. Without previous statute or contract to compel the company to keep on at a loss would be an unconstitutional taking of its property. But the prohibition does not compel the company to keep on, it simply excludes a form of authority from the decree that gives the illusion of a power to turn the property to other uses that cannot be settled in that case. \n\n[254 U.S. 513, 522]\n\u00a0\n As the state voluntarily made itself a party to the foreclosure suit before the decree went into effect, as indeed the decree never has, it might seem that the State ought to be bound in a way that otherwise it would not be. But if in a revisory proceeding the higher State Court says that the State should not be bound and that the decree was wrong in this particular, that is a local question with which we have nothing to do. The result is that although the State Court may have acted on questionable or erroneous postulates there is nothing in its action that calls for a reversal of its judgment.\n Writ of Error dismissed.\n Writ of Certiorari granted.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURDEAU v. MCDOWELL(1921)\nNo. 646\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for appellant.[ Burdeau v. McDowell \n256 U.S. 465\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[256 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Lowry Humes, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n J. C. McDowell, hereinafter called the petitioner, filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania asking for an order for the return to him of certain books, papers, memoranda, correspondence and other data in the possession of Joseph A. Burdeau, appellant herein, Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States.\n In the petition it is stated that Burdeau and his associates intended to present to the grand jury in and for the Western district of Pennsylvania a charge against petitioner of an alleged violation of section 215 of the Criminal Code of the United States (Comp. St.  10385) for the fraudulent use of the mails; that it was the intention of Burdeau and his associates, including certain post office inspectors co-operating with him, to present to the grand jury certain private books, papers, memoranda, etc., which were the private property of the petitioner; that the papers had been in the possession and exclusive control of the petitioner in the Farmers' Bank Building in Pittsburgh. It is alleged that during the spring and summer of 1920 these papers were unlawfully seized and stolen from petitioner by certain persons participating in and furthering the proposed investigation so to be made by the grand jury, under the direction and control of Burdeau as special assistant to the Attorney General, and that such books, papers, memoranda, etc., were being held in the possession and control of Burdeau and his assistants; that in the taking of the personal private books and papers the person who purloined and stole the same drilled the petitioner's private safes, broke the locks upon his private \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n desk, and broke into and abstracted from the files in his offices his private papers; that the possession of the books, papers, etc., by Burdeau and his assistants was unlawful and in violation of the legal and constitutional rights of the petitioner. It is charged that the presentation to the grand jury of the same, or any secondary or other evidence secured through or by them, would work a deprivation of petitioner's constitutional rights secured to him by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n An answer was filed claiming the right to hold and use the papers. A hearing was had before the District Judge, who made an order requiring the delivery of the papers to the clerk of the court, together with all copies, memoranda and data taken therefrom, which the court found had been stolen from the offices of the petitioner at rooms numbered 1320 and 1321 in the Farmers' Bank Building in the city of Pittsburgh. The order further provided that upon delivery of the books, papers, etc., to the clerk of the court the same should be sealed and impounded for the period of ten days, at the end of which period they should be delivered to the petitioner or his attorney unless an appeal were taken from the order of the court, in which event, the books, papers, etc., should be impounded until the determination of the appeal. An order was made restraining Burdeau, Special Assistant Attorney General, the Department of Justice, its officers and agents, and the United States attorney from presenting to the United States commissioner, the grand jury or any official tribunal, any of the books, papers, memoranda, letters, copies of letters correspondence, etc., or any evidence of any nature whatsoever secured by or coming into their possession as a result of the knowledge obtained from the inspection of such books, papers, memoranda, etc.,\n In his opinion the District Judge stated that it was the \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 472]\n\u00a0\n intention of the Department of Justice, through Burdeau and his assistants to present the books, papers, etc., to the grand jury with a view to having the petitioner indicted for the alleged violation of section 215 of the Criminal Code of the United States, and the court held that the evidence offered by the petitioner showed that the papers had been stolen from him, and that he was entitled to the return of the same. In this connection the District Judge stated that it did not appear that Burdeau, or any official or agent of the United States, or any of the departments, had anything to do with the search of the petitioner's safe, files and desk, or the abstraction therefrom of any of the writings referred to in the petition, and added that 'the order made in this case is not made because of any unlawful act on the part of anybody representing the United States or any of its departments but solely upon the ground that the government should not use stolen property for any purpose after demand made for its return.' Expressing his views, at the close of the testimony the Judge said that there had been a gross violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the federal Constitution; that the government had not been a party to any illegal seizure; that those amendments, in the understanding of the court, were passed for the benefit of the states against action by the United States-forbidden by those amendments, and that the court was satisfied that the papers were illegally and wrongfully taken from the possession of the petitioner, and were then in the hands of the government.\n So far as is necessary for our consideration certain facts from the record may be stated. Henry L. Doherty & Co. of New York were operating managers of the Cities Service Company, which company is a holding company, having control of various oil and gas companies. Petitioner was a director in the Cities Service Company \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 473]\n\u00a0\n and a director in the Quapaw Gas Company, a subsidiary company and occupied an office room in the building owned by the Farmers' Bank of Pittsburgh. The rooms were leased by the Quapaw Gas Company. McDowell occupied one room for his private office. He was employed by Doherty & Co. as the head of the natural gas division of the Cities Service Company. Doherty & Co. discharged McDowell for alleged unlawful and fraudulent conduct in the course of the business. An officer of Doherty & Co. and the Cities Service Company went to Pittsburgh in March, 1920, with authority of the president of the Quapaw Gas Company to take possession of the company's office. He took possession of room 1320; that room and the adjoining room had McDowell's name on the door. At various times papers were taken from the safe and desk in the rooms, and the rooms were placed in charge of detectives. A large quantity of papers were taken and shipped to the auditor of the Cities Service Company at 60 Wall street, New York, which was the office of that company, Doherty & Co., and the Quapaw Gas Company. The secretary of McDowell testified that room 1320 was his private office; that practically all the furniture in both rooms belonged to him; that there was a large safe belonging to the Farmers' Bank and a small safe belonging to McDowell; that on March 23, 1920, a representative of the company and a detective came to the offices; that the detective was placed in charge of room 1320; that the large safe was opened with a view to selecting papers belonging to the company, and that the representative of the company took private papers of McDowell's also. While the rooms were in charge of detectives, both safes were blown open. In the small safe nothing of consequence was found, but in the large safe papers belonging to McDowell were found. The desk was forced open, and all the papers taken from it. \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 474]\n\u00a0\n The papers were placed in cases, and shipped to Doherty & Co., 60 Wall street, New York.\n In June, 1920, following, Doherty & Co., after communication with the Department of Justice, turned over a letter, found in McDowell's desk, to the department's representative. Burdeau admitted at the hearing that as the representative of the United States in the Department of Justice he had papers which he assumed were taken from the office of McDowell. The communication to the Attorney General stated that McDowell had violated the laws of the United States in the use of the mail in the transmission of various letters to parties who owned the properties which were sold by or offered to the Cities Service Company; that some of such letters, or copies of them taken from McDowell's file, were in the possession of the Cities Service Company, that the Company also had in its possession portions of a diary of McDowell in which he had jotted down the commissions which he had received from a number of the transactions, and other data which, it is stated, would be useful in the investigation of the matter before the grand jury and subsequent prosecution should an indictment be returned.\n We do not question the authority of the court to control the disposition of the papers, and come directly to the contention that the constitutional rights of the petitioner were violated by their seizure, and that having subsequently come into the possession of the prosecuting officers of the government, he was entitled to their return. The amendments involved are the Fourth and Fifth, protecting a citizen against unreasonable searches and seizures and compulsory testimony against himself. An extended consideration of the origin and purposes of these amendments would be superfluous in view of the fact that this court has had occasion to deal with those subjects in a series of cases. Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524; Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 372; Weeks v. \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 475]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup.

Ct. 261, this term.\n The Fourth Amendment gives protection against unlawful searches and seizures, and as shown in the previous cases, its protection applies to governmental action. Its origin and history clearly show that it was intended as a restraint upon the activities of sovereign authority, and was not intended to be a limitation upon other than governmental agencies; as against such authority it was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to secure the citizen in the right of unmolested occupation of his dwelling and the possession of his property, subject to the right of seizure by process duly issued.\n In the present case the record clearly shows that no official of the federal government had anything to do with the wrongful seizure of the petitioner's property, or any knowledge thereof until several months after the property had been taken from him and was in the possession of the Cities Service Company. It is manifest that there was no invasion of the security afforded by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure, as whatever wrong was done was the act of individuals in taking the property of another. A portion of the property so taken and held was turned over to the prosecuting officers of the federal government. We assume that petitioner has an unquestionable right of redress against those who illegally and wrongfully took his private property under the circumstances herein disclosed, but with such remedies we are not now concerned.\n The Fifth Amendment, as its terms import is intended to secure the citizen from compulsory testimony against himself. It protects from extorted confessions, or examinations in court proceedings by compulsory methods.\n The exact question to be decided here is: May the \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 476]\n\u00a0\n government retain incriminating papers, coming to it in the manner described, with a view to their use in a subsequent investigation by a grand jury where such papers will be part of the evidence against the accused, and may be used against him upon trial should an indictment be returned?\n We know of no constitutional principle which requires the government to surrender the papers under such circumstances. Had it learned that such incriminatory papers, tending to show a violation of federal law, were in the hands of a person other than the accused, it having had no part in wrongfully obtaining them, we know of no reason why a subpoena might not issue for the production of the papers as evidence. Such production would require no unreasonable search or seizure, nor would it amount to compelling the accused to testify against himself.\n The papers having come into the possession of the government without a violation of petitioner's rights by governmental authority, we see no reason why the fact that individuals, unconnected with the government, may have wrongfully taken them, should prevent them from being held for use in prosecuting an offense where the documents are of an incriminatory character.\n It follows that the District Court erred in making the order appealed from, and the same is\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs.\n Plaintiff's private papers were stolen. The thief, to further his own ends, delivered them to the law officer of the United States. He, knowing them to have been stolen, retains them for use against the plaintiff. Should the court permit him to do so? \n\n[256 U.S. 465, 477]\n\u00a0\n That the court would restore the papers to plaintiff if they were still in the thief's possession is not questioned. That it has power to control the disposition of these stolen papers, although they have passed into the possession of the law officer, is also not questioned. But it is said that no provision of the Constitution requires their surrender and that the papers could have been subpoenaed. This may be true. Still I cannot believe that action of a public official is necessarily lawful, because it does not violate constitutional prohibitions and because the same result might have been attained by other and proper means. At the foundation of our civil liberty lies the principle which denies to government officials an exceptional position before the law and which subjects them to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. And in the development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been large factor. Respect for law will not be advanced by resort, in its enforcement, to means which shock the common man's sense of decency and fair play. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC A WEED & CO. v. LOCKWOOD(1921)\nNo. 407\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment having been returned against the appellant in the court below for violating the fourth section of the Lever Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff) as re-enacted by Act Oct. 22, 1919, tit. 1,  2 (41 Stat. 298), by selling wearing apparel at an unjust or unreasonable rate or charge, it filed its bill in that court praying that the United States attorney be enjoined from proceeding with the prosecution, assigning as grounds for the injunction, that the section was void because a regulation of prices of wearing apparel was beyond the power of Congress in the existing state of peace, and because the statute was too vague and deficient in standard to justify a criminal prosecution under it.\n The court, on demurrer, held that a status of war existed and that although there were some authorities to the contrary, that condition, in its opinion, conferred upon Congress the authority to fix the price at which wearing apparel might be sold, as the business of selling such merchandise was a business in which the public had an interest and which, therefore, the government could regulate. Pointing out, however, that the question as to the vagueness of the statute was more serious, the court nevertheless declared that it was of opinion that Congress had authority to provide against an unjust or unreasonable price, without fixing such price, by leaving it to be \n\n[255 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n adjusted by courts and juries, depending upon the general economic situation at the time an alleged violation of the prohibition came before them for consideration.

Elder, of New York City, for appellants.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, ILL., for the United States. \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter McFarland, of Norfolk, Neb., for Interstate Commerce commission.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal District Court for New Jersey to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the ground that it exceeds the powers of the Commission, was arbitrary, and is void. The plaintiffs were the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Pennsylvania, and 21 other railroads located in Trunk Line territory and New England. The defendants were the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The former filed a motion to dismiss; the latter an answer which admitted the material allegations of the bill of complaint. On these pleadings \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n the case was heard before three judges on an application for a preliminary injunction. This was denied without written opinion; and the case is here on appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220.\n The order of the Commission was entered upon a petition of the American Creosoting Company to which these twenty-three carriers-and no others1-were made respondents. American Creosoting Co. v. Director General, 61 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 145. It alleged that the petitioner had a creosoting plant at Newark, N. J., which was connected by switch tracks with the Central and the Pennsylvania; that these carriers had failed to establish there the privilege known as creosoting in transit; that this failure was unjust and unreasonable in violation of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887 as amended (Comp. St.  8563), and that it was also unjustly discriminatory in violation of section 3 ( section 8565). The Commission found that failure to establish this transit privilege was not unjust or unreasonable and denied relief under section 1. But it found on the facts hereinafter stated that this failure subjected the company to unjust discrimination; and, granting relief under section 3, the Commission directed that the discrimination be removed by the respondents, who are the appellants here.\n By the privilege called creosoting in transit forest products received for shipment may be stopped and unloaded at an intermediate point, there subjected to the process of creosoting, and later forwarded on the original bill of lading to the destination therein named. Where the privilege is granted and availed of, delivery is made of the commodity to the creosoting plant, as if that were the final destination. It is there unloaded and treated; \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n and at some time thereafter it is redelivered to the carrier, as if there were an initial shipment of the creosoting product. Then it is forwarded to the final destination. Although some charge is made for the transit service, the shipper secures thereby a lower freight rate. For through rates are generally much less than the rate on the untreated forest product from point of origin to the transit point plus that on the treated product from there to destination.\n The plant of the American Creosoting Company is not reached by lines of any of the twenty-three appellants except the Central and the Pennsylvania. Neither of these two carriers accords the creosoting in transit privilege at any point on its lines; and no competitor of the company has a plant on those of either. Nor is the privilege granted in Trunk Line territory by any carrier, with a single exception not here material. Some competitors of the American Creosoting Company have plants in Mississippi, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; and the several railroads on which these plants are located have, each acting independently, established the privilege at the places where those plants are situated. Under the rules of the Commission governing the making, filing and publishing of tariffs, privileges like creosoting in transit are treated as a matter local to the railroad on which the transit point is situated. Whether the privilege shall be granted or withheld is determined by the local carrier. If granted the local carrier determines the conditions; and these are set forth in the local tariff. Although a joint through route with joint rates is established by concurrent action of several carriers, the transit privilege may thus be granted by a carrier without the consent of, and without consulting, connecting carriers. And the whole revenue received for use of the privilege is retained by the local carrier. The appellants did not participate in any way in establishing the transit privileges enjoyed by \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n competitors of the Newark concern on lines of the Southern and Midwestern carriers; and none of those carriers is controlled by any of the appellants. But appellants did join with those Southern and Midwest railroads in establishing joint rates on forest products over routes which pass through the points at which this privilege prevails and also through Newark. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The order entered by the Commission declares that the twenty-three carriers, 'in so far as they participate in tariffs carrying joint rates' on these forest products 'through Newark from points in Southern classification territory to points in Northern New Jersey, Eastern New York and New England,' subject the American Creosoting Company to undue prejudice and disadvantage; and it directs these twenty-three carriers to avoid this undue prejudice. How the discrimination shall be removed is not prescribed. In effect, the order directs that, unless the Central and the Pennsylvania establish the privilege at Newark, the twenty-three carriers must withdraw from all tariffs establishing the joint rates. As to administrative orders operating in futuro, the Commission's findings of fact are conclusive, subject to qualifications here not pertinent; and a finding that the discrimination is unjust is ordinarily a finding of fact. Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 482 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 383. But the question presented here is whether the discrimination found can be held in law to be attributable to the appellants, and whether they can be required to cancel existing joint rates, unless it is removed. No finding made by the Commission can prevent \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n the review of such questions. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 U.S. 42\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 22; Philadelphia & Reading Ry. v. United States, \n240 U.S. 334\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 354.\n Creosoting in transit, like other transit privileges, rests upon the fiction that the incoming and the outgoing transportation services, which are in fact distinct, constitute a continuous shipment of the identical article from point of origin to final destination. The practice has its origin partly in local needs, partly in the competition of carriers for business. The practice is sometimes beneficial in its results; but it is open to grave abuses. \n3\n To police it adequately is difficult and expensive. Unless adequately policed, it is an avenue to illegal rebates and seriously depletes the carriers' revenues. Railroad managers differ widely as to the policy of granting such privileges. The Commission clearly has power under section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended to determine whether in a particular case a transit privilege should be granted or should be withdrawn. For that section requires, among other things, that carriers establish, in connection whth through routes and joint rates, reasonable rules and regulations. The Commission might, therefore, acting under section 1, have directed the Central and the Pennsylvania to establish the creosoting in transit practice at Newark, if it deemed failure to do so unreasonable or unjust; or it might, in an appropriate proceeding, have directed the Southern and Midwestern carriers to discontinue the practice on their lines, if it deemed the granting of the privilege to be unreasonable or unjust. But it did neither. Instead it sought to accomplish by indirection either one result or the other and ordered under section 3 that the discrimination found to exist be removed. Twenty-one of the appellants are powerless either to cause the Central \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 258]\n\u00a0\n and the Pennsylvania to install the privilege at Newark or to cause the Southern and Midwestern carriers to discontinue the practice on their lines. The Central and the Pennsylvania are likewise powerless to cause these connecting carriers to withdraw the privilege. They can, it is true, equalize conditions by establishing the privilege at Newark. But to do so would involve departure from a policy to which they have steadfastly adhered and adhesion to which was held by the Commission not to be unreasonable. If should establish the privilege at Newark, they would act contrary to their judgment and would adopt a practice which some connecting carriers had introduced without their concurrence or consent, and which may hereafter, upon appropriate inquiry, be held by the Commission to be unjust and unreasonable. Congress could not have intended that under such circumstances relief should be afforded under section 3, when a direct remedy is available under section 1.\n It is insisted that the order leaves appellants the alternative of withdrawing from the tariffs which establish joint rates with the Southern and Midwestern carriers through Newark. The order does not so provide in terms; and in fact the alleged alternative is illusory. The undue prejudice found arises not from the existence of joint rates, but from conditions local to other railroads. Cancellation of the joint rates would not change those conditions. Although the joint rates were withdrawn, the established through routes would remain. The duty to provide such routes is specifically enjoined by paragraph 4 of section 1 (Comp. St.  8563), and, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 6 (section 8569), the separately established rates of the several connecting carriers would, in the absence of joint rates. apply to through transportation. So far as appears, the Newark concern would be under the same disadvantage as compared with its competitors, whether the traffic moved on the combination of the rates local to the several lines or \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 259]\n\u00a0\n on joint rates. Even the abolition of the through routes (which is not suggested) would leave the relative positions of the several creosoting concerns unchanged. Cancellation of the joint rates would, at most, relieve appellants from the charge that they are violating the provisions of section 3.\n It is urged that, while the undue prejudice found results directly from the individual acts of Southern and Midwestern carriers in granting the privilege locally, the appellants, as their partners, make the prejudice possible by becoming the instruments through which it is applied. Discrimination may, of course, be practiced by a combination of connecting carriers as well as by an individual railroad; and the Commission has ample power under section 3 to remove discrimination so practiced. See St. Louis & Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 144\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 49. But participation merely in joint rates does not make connecting carriers partners. They can be held jointly and severally responsible for unjust discrimination only if each carrier has participated in some way in that which causes the unjust discrimination, as where a lower joint rate is given to one locality than to another similarly situated. Penn Refining Co. v. Western N. Y. & P. R. R. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 208, 221\n, 222 S., 225, 28 Sup. Ct. 268. Compare East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 516. If this were not so, the legality or illegality of a carrier's practice would depend, not on its own act, but on the acts of its connecting carriers. If that rule should prevail, only uniformity in local privileges and practices or the cancellation of all joint rates could afford to carriers the assurance that they were not in some way violating the provisions of section 3. What Congress sought to prevent by that section as originally enacted was not differences between localities in transportation rates, facilities, and privileges, but unjust discrimination between them by the \n\n[257 U.S. 247, 260]\n\u00a0\n same carrier or carriers. Neither the Transportation Act 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, nor any earlier amendatory legislation has changed, in this respect, the purpose or scope of section 3.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Except the New York, Ontario & Western Railway Company, another carrier in the Trunk Line territory, whose interests were presumably not affected by the order.

On some of the railroads the joint rates do not apply throught the transit point. On them the privilege includes and out of line movement and on some lines also a back haul to reach final destination. This broadened privilege was woulght for Newark. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Matter of Alleged Unlawful Rates and Practices, 7 Interst. Com.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 i), to obtain possession of securities in the hands of the plaintiffs in error respectively as trustees. The libel in each case alleges that the Alien Property Custodian after investigation determined that a German insurance company named was an enemy not holding a license from the President, etc.; that certain specified securities belonged to it or were held for its benefit by the party now appearing as a plaintiff in error in that case; and that a demand for the property had been made but not complied with. The libellant prayed an order directing the marshal to seize the property and citing claimants of a right to possession to show cause why the same should not be delivered to him. The plaintiffs in error appeared as claimants in their several cases, denied that the funds were held for the benefit of an enemy, and set up the trust under which they held \n\n[254 U.S. 554, 566]\n\u00a0\n them as required by the laws of Massachusetts or Connecticut for the security of American policyholders and creditors, with reasons for their right to retain the funds alleged in detail. The libellant moved for decrees for possession upon the pleadings which were granted by the District Court. The decrees were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Garvan v. $20,000 Bonds, 265 Fed. 477; Garvan v. $6,000 Bonds, 481. As the decision of the latter Court is not made final by the statute the cases have been brought on writ of error to this Court.\n As is obvious from the statement of the pleadings the libels are brought upon the theory that these are purely possessory actions and that for the purposes of immediate possession the determination of the Enemy Property Custodian is conclusive, whether right or wrong. The claimants on the other hand set up substantive rights and seek to have it decided in these suits whether the funds are enemy property in fact and whether they have not the right to detain them. Strictly possessory actions still survive in the laws of some States and have been upheld, leaving the party claiming title to a subsequent suit. Grant Timber & Manufacturing Co. v. Gray, \n236 U.S. 133\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 279. There can be no doubt that Congress has power to provide for an immediate seizure in war times of property supposed to belong to the enemy, as it could provide for an attachment or distraint, if adequate provision is made for a return in case of mistake. As it can authorize a seizure in pais it can authorize one through the help of a Court. The only questions are whether it has done so as supposed by the libellant and if so whether the conditions imposed by the Act have been performed.\n If the Custodian was entitled to demand the delivery of the property in question it does not seem to need argument to show that the demand could be enforced by the District Courts under section 17 of the Act, giving to those Courts Jurisdiction to make all such orders and decrees as may \n\n[254 U.S. 554, 567]\n\u00a0\n be necessary and proper to enforce the provisions of the Act. The first question then is whether the Custodian had the right to make the demand. By section 5 (section 3115 1\/2 c) the President may exercise any power or authority conferred by the Act through such officers as he may direct. It is admitted that he has exercised the powers material to these cases through the Enemy Property Custodian and by the Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020, the Custodian is given the right to seize. By section 7(c)-section 3115 1\/2 d-as originally enacted:\n'If the President shall so require, any money or other property owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owing or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian.'\n\n We are to take it therefore that the President has 'so required,' and that a case is made out under section 17 unless we are to consider the defences interposed.\n If we look no further than section 7(c), it is plain that obedience to the statute requires an immediate transfer in any case within its terms without awaiting a resort to the Courts. The occasion of the duty is a demand after a determination by the President and it is hard to give much meaning to the words 'which the President after investigation shall determine is so ... held' unless the determination and demand call the duty into being. The condition 'after investigation' additionally points to the intent to make his act decisive upon the point, as it is in other cases mentioned in section 7(a). But it is said that the subject of the section is enemy property only and therefore that the determination cannot be final in its effect. Day v. Micou, 18 Wall. 156. And it is true that it is not final against the claimant's rights. Upon surrender the claimant may at once file a claim under section 9 (section 3115 1\/2e), if he satisfies the representative \n\n[254 U.S. 554, 568]\n\u00a0\n of the President may obtain a return, and, if he does not obtain it in sixty days after filing his application, or forthwith if he has given the required notice but filed no application to the President, may bring a suit to establish his rights in the District Court, in which case the property is to be retained by the Custodian until final decree. These provisions explain the initial words of section 7(c) as saving the ultimate rights of the claimant while the determination of the President still may be given effect to carry out an immediate seizure for the security of the Government until the final decision upon the right. The reservation implies that mistakes may be made and assumes that the transfer will take place whether right or wrong.\n The argument on the original words of the Act in view of the manifest purpose seems to us to be strong, but it appears to us to be much strengthened by the amendments of later date. By the Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020, section 7(c), was amended among other things by adding after the requirements of transfer 'or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian; and all property thus acquired shall be held, administered and disposed of as elsewhere provided in this Act.' This shows clearly enough the peremptory character of this first step. It cannot be supposed that a resort to the Courts is to be less immediately effective then a taking with the strong hand. Clinkenbeard v. United States, 21 Wall. 65, has no application. That was debt on a bond for a tax and turned on the right of the Government to the tax, not on possession. By a later paragraph 'the sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any ... property' transferred to the Custodian 'or required so to be, or seized by him shall be that provided by the terms of this Act.' The natural interpretation of this clause is that it refers to the remedies expressly provided, in this case by section 9; that property required to be transferred and property seized stand on the same footing, not that the resort by the Custodian \n\n[254 U.S. 554, 569]\n\u00a0\n to the Courts instead of to force opens to the person who has declined to obey the order of the statute or who has prevented a seizure a right by implication to delay what the statute evidently means to accomplish at once.\n To the conclusion that we reach it is objected that the Custodian gets a good deal more than bare possession-that the property is to be conveyed to him, and that by the Act of March 28, 1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 459, 460 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 ff), enlarging section 12, the Custodian 'shall be vested with all of the powers of a common-law trustee in respect of all property, other than money, which has been or shall be, or which has been or shall be required to be, conveyed,' etc., to him, and is given the power to sell and manage the same as though he were absolute owner. All this may be conceded if no claim is filed. But this act did not repeal section 9, which is amended by the later Acts of July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35, and of June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977, and as we have said, provides for immediate claim and suit and requires the property in cases of suit to be retained in the custody of the Alien Property Custodian or in the Treasury of the United States to abide the result. The present proceeding gives nothing but the preliminary custody such as would have been gained by seizure. It attaches the property to make sure that it is forthcoming if finally condemned and does no more.\n Decrees affirmed.\n The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of these causes. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHASE v.

C., for the United States.\n Mr. O. C. Anderson, of West Point, Neb.\n (Mr. Charles J. Kappler, of Washington, D. C., of counsel), for Omaha Tribe of Indians, by special leave.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit to adjudge Hiram Chase, Jr., a member of the Omaha Tribe of Indians and to have a right to select 80 acres for an allotment out of the lands of the Omaha Reservation, the selection having been denied by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The right of selection depends upon the effect of certain treaties between the Omaha Tribe and the United States and certain acts of Congress.\n The treaties were made in 1854 and 1865 (10 Stat. 1043; 14 Stat. 667), and by them the Indians ceded certain lands to the United States and certain other lands were retained constituting the reservation with which this suit is concerned and of which the lands sought to be allotted are a part. \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n It was expressed in the treaty of 1865 to be the desire of the Indians to abolish the tenure in common by which they held their lands and to acquire tracts in severalty of 160 acres to heads of families and 40 acres to each male person of 18 years and upwards; and it was provided that the whole of the lands so assigned or unassigned should constitute and be known as the Omaha Reservation.\n The assignments were to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, be evidenced by certificates, and be final and conclusive.\n In execution of the purposes of the treaty Congress passed an act in 1882 (22 Stat. 341) by which the Secretary was authorized to allot the portion of the reservation lying east of the Sioux City & Nebraska Railroad in severalty to a head of a family a quarter section (160 acres), to each single person over 18 one-eighth of a section, to each orphan child under 18 one-eighth of a section, and to each other person under that age one-sixteenth of a section. The issue of patents was provided for, the lands to be held in trust for 25 years for the sole use and benefit of the respective allottees; and it was provided that the residue of the lands should be patented to the tribe, but held in trust for 25 years, then to be conveyed in fee discharged of the trust. From these lands, however, it was provided the allotments should be made and patented to each Omaha child who might be born prior to the expiration of the 25-year trust period.\n Under the act and prior to July 11, 1884, allotments were made to 954 members of the tribe and patents issued therefor. No patent was issued to the tribe as provided.\n By the Indian Appropriation Act passed March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. 630), and expressing itself to be an amendment to the act of 1882, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized with censent of the Indian tribe to allot in severalty--\n'... to each Indian woman and child of said tribe born since allotments of land were \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n made in severalty to the members thereof under the provisions of said act \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 1882]\n\u00a0\n, and now living, one-eighth of a section of the residue lands held by that tribe in common, instead of one-sixteenth of a section, as therein provided, and to allot in severalty to each allottee under said act, now living, who received only one-sixteenth of a section thereunder, an additional one-sixteenth of a section of such residue lands. ...'\n\n Hiram Chase was not born until after the act of 1893 was passed, and the question is whether he is entitled to an allotment under it. The government contends to the negative, basing the contention upon an act passed May 11, 1912 (37 Stat. 111), which, it is the further contention, repealed the act of 1893, and cut off the right of allotment.\n The District Court yielded to the contention and dismissed the bill, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 261 Fed. 833.\n Against this action of the courts appellant asserts error, and insists that it and the contention of the government are based on an underestimate of his rights and upon a wrong construction of the act of 1893\n\n\n First, as to his rights. The contention is that appellant had a vested right to an allotment 'under the treaties and acts of Congress as they existed at the time when' the allotment was 'selected and claimed,' and this whether the act of 1912 repealed the act of 1893, or was subordinate to or complementary of its provisions. In support of the contention appellant recites the various provisions of the treaty of 1865 and the acts of 1882 and 1893, and insists that they are clear and direct investments of irrevocable rights in pursuance of 'a contractual obligation based upon ample consideration.' In specification the treaty of 1854 is adduced as having 'ceded to the United States a portion of the reservation described in article I' and 'by article VI individual Indians were to receive allotments \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n of land.' This purpose, is the further contention, was executed by the treaty of 1865 by which the Indians 'did cede, sell, and convey to the United States' a part of their reservation, and among other provisions there was one, expressed in article IV of the treaty, for allotments to be 'for the exclusive use ... of themselves [the Indians] their heirs and descendants.'\n Of the obligations thus incurred, it is the insistence, section 8 of the act of 1882 was the fulfillment, and at the expiration of the trust period the reservation (residue) was to be conveyed to the tribe 'in fee discharged of the trust and free of all charges or incumbrances whatsoever' and that, therefore, the act of 1912 which directed the sale of the unallotted lands of the reservation was in contravention of the treaties and the rights to allotments thereunder and under the acts of Congress of 1882 and 1893, supra.\n The contention is one that has often been made in this court and rejected as often as made. Gritts v. Fisher, \n224 U.S. 640\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 580; Choate v. Trapp, \n224 U.S. 665\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 565; Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 294\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 115. In those cases the relation of the individual Indian to the tribal property is explained, and also the power of Congress over that property and the tribes. In the recent case of United States v. Chase, \n245 U.S. 89\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 24, we had occasion to consider the reservation here involved and the effect of article IV of the treaty of 1865 relied on by the appellant, and decided that its purpose was to do no 'more than individualize the existing tribal right of occupancy,' and that it left 'the fee in the United States' and left 'the United States and the tribe free to take such measures for the ultimate and permanent disposal of the lands, including the fee, as might become essential or appropriate in view of changing conditions, the welfare of the Indians and the public interests.'\n The case dealt with assignments under article IV, but \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n its principle hecessarily applies to a mere right under the act of 1882. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 557\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 216; Sizemore v. Brady, \n235 U.S. 441\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 135; Cherokee Intermarriage Cases, \n203 U.S. 76\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 29; Wallace v. Adams, \n204 U.S. 415\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 363; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 U.S. 445\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 722.\n The next contention of appellant is that he acquired a vested right under the acts of 1882 and 1893, assuming the latter act did not repeal the other, and we are brought to the act of 1912. By the act the Secretary is--\n'authorized to cause to be surveyed, if necessary, and appraised, in such manner as he may direct, in tracts of 40 acres each, or as nearly as to the Secretary may seem practicable, and, after such survey and appraisement, to sell and convey, in quantities not to exceed 160 acres to any one purchaser, all the unallotted lands on the Omaha Indian Reservation, in the state of Nebraska, except such tracts as are hereinafter specifically reserved: Provided, that the said land shall be sold to the highest bidder under such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, but no part of said land shall be sold at less than the appraised value thereof. ...'\n\n There is provision for the reservation from sale of certain tracts with which this case is not otherwise concerned except as it shows complete delegation of administration to the Secretary. Appellant's contention is that the act is neither directory nor mandatory; it is permissive only and has been, it is said, so construed by the Secretary. There are cases, however, that decide that an officer 'authorized' is an officer commanded in a matter of public concern. \n1\n Besides, there are words of direction in the act and they are necessary to its purposes. But if it \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n may be assumed there is a discretion in the Secretary he has exercised it against the appellant by denying his right to an allotment, presumably in reservation of the land for sale as provided in the act. And a sale is provided for-a sale of the unallotted lands mentioned in section 8 of the act of 1882, and all of them. We agree, therefore, with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it (the act of 1912) 'covers so completely the subject of the disposition' of those lands 'that it must be held to have repealed that portion of the act of 1882 which authorized allotments to Omaha children during the trust period.' And, again quoting the Court of Appeals:\n'The Secretary of the Interior, of course, could not allot the unallotted lands under the act of 1882, and also sell them under the act of 1912; nor could he allot the unallotted lands and at the same time make the reservations which he is commanded to make by section 2 of the latter act. It is so plain that both acts cannot be carried out that it is unnecessary to discuss that question.'\n\n It supersedes, therefore, that act though it contains no repealing words. United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88; King v. Cornell, \n106 U.S. 395\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 312; Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 685\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 290.\n This appeal is a review of the second trial of the case. In the first trial the District Court on motion of the United States dismissed the bill. Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and remanded the case to that court 'with instructions to permit the defendant ( United States) to answer, if so advised.' 238 Fed. 894, 152 C. C. A. 28.\n Upon the return of the case the United States set up as a defense the act of 1912 presenting the questions here involved.\n Appellant contends that the United States--\n'having relied at the first trial upon the single proposition that the Act of 1893 repealed the Act of 1882 and thereby cut off the right of these Indian claimants to allotments, and \n\n[256 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n having failed in that defense, cannot, upon the second trial, abandon that defense and insist that the Act of May 11, 1912, repealed the Act of 1882.'\n\n The proposition has a relevant and conclusive application when a judgment of a former action is pleaded but limited application when urged in the same suit, it expresses a practice only and useful as such, but not a limitation of power. Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 U.S. 436\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 739.\n The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals having the power and exercising it entertained the defense of the act of 1912, estimated it and decided it conclusive against appellant's right to an allotment. As we have seen there was no error in that ruling, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Anne Arundel County Com'rs v.

Anglin and Alfred Stevenson, both of Holdenville, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma by the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, to have declared void a special assessment for street improvement made against part of its right of way and station grounds in the city of Holdenville, Okl., and to enjoin the taking of any proceedings to enforce the same. The Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Company, the lessor, was joined as plaintiff. The defendants are the county treasurer, the city, and the holders of bonds issued to pay for the improvement. The street improved, called Oklahoma avenue, runs parallel to the main tracks. The station grounds abut on the avenue for a distance of 1,641 feet, and the parcel assessed extends back from the avenue 150 feet to the center of the right of way. Over this street a large part of the traffic to and from the station necessarily passes, for between it and the main \n\n[256 U.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n tracks lie the passenger depot, the freight houses, the express office, the cotton platform, an oil warehouse, grain elevators, coal bins, and the team tracks. The assessment is assailed as invalid on several grounds. The chief contention is that the property is immune from assessment by the state because that part of the railroad was an instrumentality of the federal government. The other grounds of attack are that in laying the assessment the property was not sufficiently identified, and that the assessment of a railroad right of way and station grounds is not authorized by the law of the state. The District Court entered a decree for plaintiffs, which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, with directions to dismiss the bill. 261 Fed. 342. The case comes here under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n First. The claim of immunity from assessment rests upon these facts: The right of way and station grounds are on land which had belonged to the Creek Nation before the town (now city) was established under direction of the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the original Creek Agreement. Act of March 1, 1901, c. 676,  10, 31 Stat. 861, 864. The Rock Island acquired its interest on March 24, 1904, under a lease from the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf, for a period of 999 years, of all of its railroad property. The lessor company had, in locating its railroad through Holdenville, taken, besides the right of way 100 feet wide, an additional strip for station purposes 200 feet wide, with a length of 3,000 feet, having acquired the power so to do by succeeding to the powers and franchises of the Choctaw Coal & Railway Company. To that company Congress had in 1888 granted the right to build a railroad in Indian Territory, with a branch line to coal mines leased from the Choctaw Nation. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[256 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n The contention is that the railroad is an instrumentality through which the government undertook to perform its obligation to develop coal lands belonging to the Indians, and that, if the railroad's interest in the right of way and station grounds could be subjected to a special assessment and possible sale thereunder apart from the railroad franchises, the congressional purpose might be obstructed. Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Co. v. Harrison, \n235 U.S. 292\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 27. See, also, Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 671; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 U.S. 522\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 453.\n The mere fact that property is used, among others, by the United States as an instrument for effecting its purpose does not relieve it from state taxation. The most that can be said here is that among the public served by this railroad are some mines on land leased from the Choctaw Nation. The right of way and station grounds in question, instead of being, as was perhaps originally contemplated by the Act of February 18, 1888, part of a branch to leased 'coal veins,' have become an integral \n\n[256 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n part of through lines of a great railroad system. \n2\n Holdenville is on the main line of the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf, which extends from the west bank of the Mississippi river, through Arkansas and Oklahoma, to the Texas state line, a distance of nearly 650 miles. By the lease to the Rock Island, this railroad has become a part of the through lines of a much larger system. And even though it be granted that the federal government utilized the railroad as an instrument in working out its policy toward the Indians, the tax upon the railroad property would be none the less valid. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 36; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 U.S. 530\n, 546-548, 8 Sup. Ct. 961; Central Pacific Railroad Co. v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 125\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 766; Thomas v. Gay, \n169 U.S. 264\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 340.\n Second. Equally unfounded is the contention that the assessment did not sufficiently identify the property, and was hence a denial of due process of law. The Oklahoma statute under which the assessment was made ( Compl. Laws 1909,  724), provides that:\n'If any portion of the property abutting upon such improvement shall not be platted into lots and blocks, the mayor and council shall include such property in proper quarter block district for the purpose of appraisement and assessment, as herein provided.'\n\n The railroad premises not having been platted, the mayor and council adopted a map of the city engineer, on which the right of way and station grounds were set forth in proper quarter block districts. The premises \n\n[256 U.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n assessed were those quarter blocks thereon designated as abutting on that portion of Oklahoma avenue which was improved, and the designation was clear. Some time after the passage of the ordinance providing for the assessment this map was inadvertently removed from the city files, sent to the purchasers of the bonds issued for the improvement, and not returned until after the lapse of a considerable time. But the railroad companies had full knowledge of the proceedings relating to the assessment and of the commencement, the progress and the completion of the improvement. There is not even a suggestion that they were injured or misled by the temporary absence of the map from the city files. Such removal did not invalidate the assessment. Furthermore, mere insufficiency of description or other irregularity in the proceeding would not entitile abutting landowners to the relief sought here. Their right would be limited to having the mayor and council make a reassessment conforming to the regulations prescribed by the statute. See Laws Okl. 1907-08, p. 176,  7, 8; Oklahoma Railway v. Severns, etc., Co., \n251 U.S. 104\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 73.\n Third. The remaining contention is that the statutes of the state do not authorize assessment for betterments upon a railroad right of way and station grounds. The mere fact that there is a possible right of reverter in the Creek Nation does not preclude the railroad's interest from being subject to general taxation. See Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 50; Maricopa & Phoenix Railroad v. Arizona, \n156 \nU.S. 347, 352\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 391. The railroad's interest, as stated in Rio Grande Railway Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44, 47\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 5, 6, is--\n'neither a mere easement, nor a fee simple absolute, but a limited fee, made on an implied condition of reversion in the event that the company ceases to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it is granted, and carries with it the incidents and remedies usually attending the fee.'\n\n In \n\n[256 U.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n effect the railroad is the absolute owner of the land. Its use is, and necessarily must be, exclusive. The betterment for which the assessment was levied is of a nature to enhance the value of that use. And it is the railroad, as distinguished from the Creek Nation, owner of a possible reversionary interest, to which the benefit from the improvement enures. For the railroad's use will continue indefinitely, while the specific improvement to be paid for can have but a short life.\n Street paving is a class of betterment to which the railroad right of way and station property is generally held to be subject. See Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n197 U.S. 430\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 466; Branson v. Bush, \n251 U.S. 182\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 113. The rule appears to have been accepted in Oklahoma. Compare Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Tulsa, 45 Okl. 382, 145 Pac. 398; Oklahoma Railway Co. v. Severns Paving Co., \n251 U.S. 104\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 73. It is urged that, if the assessment is left unpaid, a sale to enforce the lien would sever an integral part of the railway. The same objection might be urged against the validity of a lien for general taxes locally assessed upon railroad property or a mechanic's lien upon the same. The objection is clearly unsound. Compare Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. Tansey, 41 Okl. 543, 139 Pac. 267; Same v. Rosier, 38 Okl. 231, 132 Pac. 908; Same v. Wallace, 38 Okl. 233, 132 Pac. 908, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 112. If the validity of the assessment is established, it may be assumed that due payment will follow. At all events, we have no occasion to deal with the method and means to be pursued in enforcing it.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Cong. Feb. 18, 1888, c. 13, 25 Stat. 35.

Bell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendant in error. \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A suit for injunction brought in a state court by Anderson against Durr, then auditor, and Cooper, then treasurer, of Hamilton county, Ohio, raised the question whether a certain property tax imposed under authority of the state of Ohio upon plaintiff, a resident of that state, by reason of his owning a membership-figuratively termed a 'seat'-in the New York Stock Exchange, infringed his rights under the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States or the 'due process of law' or 'equal protection' provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. His assault upon the tax was sustained by the court of first instance (20 Ohio N. P. [N. S.] 538), but overruled by the Court of Appeals (29 O. C. A. 465), and finally by the Supreme Court of the state (100 Ohio St. 251, 126 N. E. 57). Until the decision of the latter court the federal right had been asserted merely as a claim of immunity from the tax under the constitutional provisions referred to, without drawing in question the validity of any statute of, or authority exercised under the state on the ground of their being repugnant to those provisions. After the final decision, in an application to the Supreme Court for a rehearing, plaintiff for the first time asserted that the decision, if adhered to, rendered the Ohio taxation statutes invalid because of such repugnance. This application was denied without reasons given, and hence must be regarded as having come too late to raise any question for review by this court. Loeber v. Schroeder, \n149 \nU.S. 580, 585\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 934, Fullerton v. Texas, \n196 \nU.S. 192, 193\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 221; Corkran Oil Co. v. Arnaudet, \n199 \nU.S. 182, 193\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 41. Therefore a writ of error, allowed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, must be dismissed because not the proper mode of review under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214). But an application for the allowance of a writ of certiorari, made to this court under \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 107]\n\u00a0\n the same section, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the writ of error, will be granted, and the case determined thereunder.\n The essential facts are as follows: Plaintiff holds a membership or seat in the New York Stock Exchange for which he paid $60,000, and which carries valuable privileges and has a market value for the purposes of sale. The Exchange is not a corporation or stock company, but a voluntary association consisting of 1,100 members, governed by its own constitution, by-laws and rules, and holding the beneficial ownership of the entire capital stock of a New York corporation which owns the building in which the business of the Exchange is transacted, with the land upon which it stands, situated in the city of New York and having a value in excess of $ 5,000,000. A member has the privilege of transacting a brokerage business in securities listed upon the Exchange, but may personally buy or sell only in the Exchange building. Membership is evidenced merely by a letter from the secretary of the Exchange notifying the recipient that he has been elected to membership. Admissions to membership are made on the vote of the committee on admissions. Membership may be transferred only upon approval of the transfer by the committee, and the proceeds are applied first to pay charges and claims against the retiring member arising under the rules of the Exchange, any surplus being paid to him. On the death of a member, his membership is subject to be disposed of by the committee; but his widow and descendants are entitled to certain payments out of a fund known as the 'gratuity fund.' In the business of brokers in stocks and bonds a differentiation is made between members of the Exchange and nonmembers, in that business is transacted by members on account of other members at a commission materially less than that charged to nonmembers. A firm having as a general partner a member of the Exchange is entitled to \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 108]\n\u00a0\n have its business transacted at the rates prescribed for members.\n That a membership held by a resident of the state of Ohio in the Exchange is a valuable property right, intangible in its nature but of so substantial a character as to be a proper subject of property taxation, is too plain for discussion. That such a membership, although partaking of the nature of a personal privilege and assignable only with qualifications, is property within the meaning of the bankrupt laws, has repeatedly been held by this court. Hyde v. Woods, \n94 U.S. 523\n, 524-525; Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 104; Page v. Edmunds, \n187 \nU.S. 596, 601\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 200. Whether it is subjected to taxation by the taxing laws of Ohio is a question of state law, answered in the affirmative by the court of last resort of that state, by whose decision upon this point we are controlled. Clement Nat. Bank v. Vermont, \n231 \nU.S. 120, 134\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 31.\n The chief contention here is based upon the due process of law provision of the Fourteenth Amendment: it being insisted that the privilege of membership in the Exchange is so inseparably connected with specific real estate in New York that its taxable situs must be regarded as not within the jurisdiction of the state of Ohio. Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 U.S. 385\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 463, is cited. It is very clear, however, as the Supreme court held, that the valuable privilege of such membership is not confined to the real estate of the Stock Exchange; that a member has a contractual right to have the association conducted in accordance with its rules and regulations, and incidentally, has the right to deal through other members on certain fixed percentages and methods of division of commissions; that this right to secure the services of other members and to 'split commissions' is a valuable right, by which plaintiff in Cincinnati may properly hold himself out as a member entitled to the privileges of the Exchange, denied to nonmembers; and \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 109]\n\u00a0\n that thus he is enabled to conduct from and in his Cincinnati office a lucrative business through other members in New York. The court held, and was warranted in holding, that the membership is personal property, and being without fixed situs has a taxable situs at the domicile of the owner. Mobilia sequuntur personam. See Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 36. The asserted analogy to Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, supra, cannot be accepted. That decision related to a public franchise arising out of legislative grant, held to be an incorporeal hereditament in the nature of real property and to have no taxable situs outside the granting state. It did not involve the taxation of intangible personal property. See Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 201, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 558.\n Nor is plaintiff's case stronger if we assume that the membership privileges exercisable locally in New York enable that state to tax them even as against a resident of Ohio. See Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n240 \nU.S. 184, 191\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 265. Exemption from double taxation by one and the same state is not guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment (St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 367-368, 35 Sup. Ct. 99); much less is taxation by two states upon identical or closely related property interests falling within the jurisdiction of both, forbidden (Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 401; Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 201, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124).\n That plaintiff is denied the equal protection of the laws, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, cannot be successfully maintained upon the record before us. The argument is that other brokers in the same city are not taxed upon the value of their memberships in the local stock exchange, nor upon the privilege of doing business in New York Stock Exchange securities. As to the \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 110]\n\u00a0\n local exchange memberships, it may be that the failure to tax them is but accidental or due to some negligence of subordinate officers, and is not properly to be regarded as the act of the state. If it be state action, there is a presumption that some fair reason exists to support the exemption, not applicable to a membership in the New York Exchange, and plaintiff has shown nothing to overcome the presumption. As to the privilege referred to it already has been shown that the rights incident to plaintiff's property interest give him pecuniary advantages over others in the same business. Manifestly this furnishes a reasonable ground for taxing him upon the property right, although others enjoying lesser privileges because of not having it may remain untaxed.\n The contention that the tax constitutes a direct burden upon interstate commerce is groundless. Ordinary property taxation imposed upon property employed in interstate commerce does not amount to an unconstitutional burden upon the commerce itself. Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 876; Cleveland, etc., Railway Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1122; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 700\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 268, 360.\n Writ of error Dismissed.\n Writ of certiorari granted.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Additional Opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The question whether a seat in the New York Stock Exchange is taxable in Ohio consistently with the principles established by this court seems to me more difficult than it does to my Brethren. All rights are intangible personal relations between the subject and the object of them created by law. But it is established that it is not enough that the subject, the owner of the right, is within the power of the taxing state. He cannot be taxed for land situated elsewhere, and the same is true of personal \n\n[257 U.S. 99, 111]\n\u00a0\n property permanently out of the jurisdiction. It does not matter, I take it, whether the interest is legal or equitable, or what the machinery by which it is reached, but the question is whether the object of the right is so local in its foundation and prime meaning that it should stand like an interest in land. If left to myself I should have thought that the foundation and substance of the plaintiff's right was the right of himself and his associates personally to enter the New York Stock Exchange building and to do business there. I should have thought that all the rest was incidental to that and that that on its face was localized in New York. If so, it does not matter whether it is real or personal property or that it adds to the owner's credit and facilities in Ohio. The same would be true of a great estate in New York land.\n As my Brothers VAN DEVANTER and McREYNOLDS share the same doubts it has seemed to us proper that they should be expressed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF SAN ANTONIO v. SAN ANTONIO PUBLIC SERVICE CO(1921)\nNo. 263\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. J. McMillan, of San Antonio, Tex., for appellants.\n Mr. S. J. Brooks, of San Antonio, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decree below enjoined the city of San Antonio from enforcing a five-cent fare against the Public Service Company, operating street railway lines in that city, on the ground that the right to enforce such rate was not secured to the city by contract, and such enforcement was beyond the power of the city, because of the confiscation of the property of the railway company which would result, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The consideration we must give the subject will be clarified by outlining the origin and development of the controversy.\n In March, 1899, the city of San Antonio by ordinance extended to July 1, 1940, 'the rights, privileges and franchises heretofore granted to and existing in the San \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n Antonio Gas Company, Mutual Electric Light Company, San Antonio Street Railway Company, and the San Antonio Edison Company.' The ordinance provided, among other things, that the two companies last named, which operated street railways in the city, 'shall charge five cents fare for one continuous ride over any one of their lines, with one transfer to or from either line to the other.'\n In April, 1900, all the property of the two railway companies was sold under a decree or a state court to the San Antonio Traction Company, and that company, with the approval of the city, thereafter controlled and carried on both lines.\n In 1903 the state enacted a half-fare law (Laws 1903, c. 116), making it the duty of the Traction Company to carry school children and students for half fare, and subsequently an ordinance was passed by the city in furtherance of this law. The company refusing to carry out this legislation, on the ground that it impaired the obligation of its contract as to rate of fare resulting from the ordinance of 1899, in violation of the Constitutions of the state and of the United States, a suit by mandamus to compel it to do so was begun by an individual, and from a ruling adverse to the company's contention the case was taken to the Court of Civil Appeals. That court held that it was unnecessary to consider whether the rate requirement was a contract, because, as it was adopted long after the provision of the state Constitution (article 1,  17) that 'no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be made, but all privileges and franchises granted by the Legislature or created under its authority shall be subject to the control thereof,' it was necessarily to that extent restricted, and therefore left the state free, within the limits of the restriction, to exert the authority to regulate. As a result, the half-fare law was upheld, obviously upon the conclusion that it was within the power \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n to regulate as restricted by the constitutional provision. San Antonio Traction Co. v. Altgelt (Tex. Civ. App.) 81 S. W. 106.\n Because of the federal question the case was brought to this court and the decree was affirmed substantially on the ground which had controlled the decision below. In addition, however, the court was careful to point out that the state Constitution prohibited a rate regulation which was confiscatory, but that, in view of the absence of all averment that the rate in question was confiscatory, it was unnecessary to deal with that subject. San Antonio Traction Co. v. Altgelt, \n200 U.S. 304\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 261.\n Presumably under the power to regulate as thus established the city thereafter passed, and the Traction Company carried out, an ordinance imposing the duty of free transportation of policemen and firemen.\n In 1912 the state Constitution was amended, so as to authorize cities having more than 5,000 inhabitants, by vote of their electors, to amend their charters or adopt new ones, subject to the limitation that the charters should not contain any provision inconsistent with the Constitution or general laws of the state. Const. Tex. art. 11,  5.\n In the meantime the two companies, gas and electric, dealt with in the ordinance of 1899, were consolidated and became the San Antonio Gas & Electric Company, and in 1917 appellee, the San Antonio Public Service Company, petitioned the city government to consent to its acquisition of all the rights and property of the San Antonio Traction Company and of the San Antonio Gas & Electric Company, thus proposing to bring under one control the four corporations dealt with in the ordinance of 1899. The city consented by an ordinance which expressly subjected the Public Service Company to all the limitations, duties and obligations which rested upon the Traction Company and the Gas & Electric Company. The ordinance further provided that:\n'In accepting the provisions of this ordinance the \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n San Antonio Public Service Company agrees that the city shall hereafter have the right to pass all ordinances not in direct conflict with the laws of this state fixing and regulating the rates, prices and terms at which gas and electricity shall be furnished for public and private purposes to the city and its inhabitants.'\n\n This was followed by provisions requiring the keeping of such accounts by the Public Service Company in its gas and electric departments as would enable the city to exercise the power to fix rates as to gas and electricity. The ordinance having been accepted by the Public Service Company, the consolidation was accomplished.\n At and for a long time prior to the consolidation the penal code of the city contained a provision, accompanied by a penalty for its violation, forbidding, except during certain hours of the night, the charging of more than a five-cent fare within the city limits. Shortly after the approval of the consolidation, another ordinance was passed forbidding and penalizing any person, firm or corporation, enjoying franchises within the city limits, or their agents or employees, from charging more than the rate then charged and collected, without obtaining the permission of the city. In conformity with this last-mentioned ordinance the Public Service Company, in August, 1918, applied to the city for permission to increase its rate of fare from five to six cents, based upon the ground that although the five-cent fare was remunerative at the time it was fixed, it had, by the increase in cost of operation in practically every department, become wholly insufficient for that purpose and could not be continued without confiscating the property of the company. After a hearing the city, by an ordinance reciting that as the company was bound by the 40-year franchise granted in 1899 to charge five-cent fare, the city did not feel authorized nor called upon to set it aside, and furthermore that the hearing had shown no necessity for \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n the change in rate asked, refused the company's request, at the same time prohibiting, under a penalty which was stated, any person, firm, or corporation operating any street railway within or partly within the city from charging more than a five-cent fare.\n Thereupon the company commenced this suit by filing its bill to enjoin the city from enforcing the five-cent fare ordinance. The bill, after alleging the adequacy of the rate of five cents when originally fixed in 1899, contained the amplest averments concerning its present confiscatory character. The prayer was for a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of the five-cent fare ordinances and from interfering with the company in putting in a seven-cent fare instead, and from enforcing the ordinances which forbade a change of fare. It was prayed that, if the company was not permitted to put in effect the seven- cent fare, the court would itself establish that rate, or such other as it might find necessary to enable the company to pay its operating expenses and to earn a reasonable sum on its investment, and that a permanent injunction securing the results prayed be awarded.\n The city moved to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction because it presented no substantial stantial federal question, as it showen on its face that the parties were bound by the five-cent fare provision of the franchise ordinance as a contract subject to be enforced even though the rate was confiscatory, and moreover because the bill otherwise stated no ground for equitable relief. The court overruled the motion. It reviewed the history of the case and decided that, in view of the controversy as to contract growing out of the enforcement of the half-fare law terminated by the ruling of this court in the Altgelt Case, as well as of all the subsequent dealings between the parties, the existence of a contract as to the five-cent fare was not established and hence the attempt to enforce it, because of the confiscation to result, gave a cause of \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n action under the Constitution of the United States. San Antonio Public Service Co. v. San Antonio (D. C.) 257, fed. 467.\n The city then answered, reiterating the grounds of its previous challenge to the jurisdiction and asserting that the franchise ordinance rate was based upon a contract resulting from that ordinance and from the action taken at the time and in furtherance of the consolidation. It further asserted an estoppel to deny the contract arising from various acts of the city and the corporation or its predecessors from the time of the ordinance in 1899 to the bringing of the suit 1918. Moreover, disputing the confiscatory character of the five-cent fare, it claimed the right to compel its continued exaction in virtue of its general governmental authority to regulate the fares of street reilway companies.\n The case was referred to a master to report on the facts and the law. Before the master a hearing was had, followed by an elaborate report on both subjects. As the action of the court overruling the exception to its jurisdiction had adversely disposed of the question of the existence of the contract concerning the five-cent fare, the master put that subject out of view and therefore reported only on the facts as to the confiscatory character of the five-cent rate and of the power of the court, under the assumption that it was confiscatory, to restrain its enforcement.\n A few words from the report will suffice to make manifest the conclusion of the master. He said:\n'The rate prescribed by the ordinance is insufficient, because of the changed conditions since the rate was fixed 20 years ago, to enable the company to earn a fair return; but I have reached the conclusion that to admit the contention of the company would be for the court to exercise a power it does not possess. ... A rate, reasonable when fixed, does not become unreasonable, from the judicial point of view, because of changed conditions.' \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n Although the Public Service Company excepted to the conclusion of law thus stated and to some of the separate conclusions of fact made by the master, no exception whatever to the report was made by the city, and the case therefore went to the court upon the admitted confiscatory character of the rate, upon the question of contract, and upon the power of the court, if no such contract existed, to restrain the confiscation which would result from giving effect to the rate. Adhering to its previous ruling, the court declared that it had jurisdiction to prevent the admitted confiscation which would result from the five-cent rate. Concluding, however, that as the court was not a primary rate-making authority, it would not fix a reasonable rate to replace the five-cent rate, the enforcement of which would be enjoined, and expressing the hope that the parties might agree upon such a rate, it announced that it would postpone shaping the final decree for that purpose.\n\n Some weeks afterward the final decree was entered. It enjoined the city from interfering with the complainant in substituting a seven-cent fare for the five-cent fare, and besides enjoined the city from enforcing the various ordinances complained of in the bill, prohibiting and punishing the charging of a higher rate than five cents. The decree reserved, however, the right to the city to ask relief whenever, because of a change in conditions, the five-cent fare should cease to be confiscatory. In addition, the enforcement of the city ordinance imposing the half-fare rate for school children was enjoined, although the continued enforcement of the state half-fare law, which had been upheld in the Altgelt Case, was expressly declared not to be restrained. On the direct appeal of the city because of the constitutional question involved, we are called upon, as at the outset stated, to determine whether error was committed in the decree thus rendered. \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 555]\n\u00a0\n That, in view of the admitted fact of confiscation, the court had power to deal with the subject, we are of opinion is too clear for anything but statement. And we think it is equally clear that, as the right to regulate gave no power whatever to violate the Constitution by enforcing a confiscatory rate, a result which could only be sustained as a consequence of the duty to pay such rate arising from the obligations of a contract, it follows that the solitary question to be considered is whether a contract existed empowering the city to enforce the confiscatory rate.\n Primarily the answer to that question must depend upon whether the ordinance of 1899 fixing the five-cent rate was a contract. That it was not, and could not be, we are of opinion is the necessary result of the provision of section 17, article 1, of the state Constitution, existing in 1899, prohibiting 'any irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges,' etc., when considered in the light of the irrevocable and uncontrollable elements which must necessarily inhere in the ordinance of 1899 to give it the contract consequence relied upon. Indeed, this result is persuasively established by the ruling in the Altgelt Case, to the effect that, if the contract right were conceded, there would, in view of the constitutional restriction, be such an inevitable conflict between that right and the dominant power to regulate as to render the contract right inoperative, and therefore to cause it to perish from the mere fact of admitting its conflict with the authority to regulate.\n But it is urged that as, by the amendment to the state Constitution of 1912, the city was endowed with authority broad enough to enable it to contract in granting a street railway franchise concerning the rate of fare to be charged, disenthralled from the limitation of section 17, article 1, of the state Constitution, it follows that the franchise ordinance must after that date be viewed as such a contract and treated accordingly. But as no contract between the \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 556]\n\u00a0\n city and the Traction Company, made after the constitutional amendment in 1912 concerning the fare in question, is referred to, it is plain that, even if the proposition as to power of the city after 1912 be, for the sake of the argument, conceded, it is irrelevant to the case we are considering.\n And this is true, also, of the suggestion, made in argument, that, although no contract was possible under the constitutional restriction which would bind the city not to lower the rate, nevertheless there was a unilateral contract or condition, resulting from the granting of the franchise, which bound the railway company to the franchise rate, since again there is not the slightest suggestion of any attempt on the part of the parties consciously to produce such a condition. But, besides, the error underlying the proposition is not far to seek. The duty of an owner of private property used for the public service to charge only a reasonable rate, and thus respect the authority of government to regulate in the public interest. and of government to regulate by fixing such a reasonable rate as will safeguard the rights of private ownership, are interdependent and reciprocal. Where, however, the right to contract exists, and the parties, the public on the one hand and the private on the other, do so contract, the law of the contract governs both the duty of the private owner and the governmental power to regulate. Were, therefore, as in the case supposed in the argument, the regulating power of government wholly uncontrolled by contract, it would follow that that power would be required to be exerted and hence the supposed condition operating upon the private owner would be nugatory. Such a case really presents no question of a condition, since it resolves itself into a mere issue of the exercise by government of its regulatory power.\n Further, however, it is urged that, as at the time of the consolidation in 1917 the powers of the city were not \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 557]\n\u00a0\n limited by the constitutional provision referred to, the necessary effect of the obligations which the Public Service Company came under was to convert the five-cent fare ordinance into a contract conferring the right to enforce it, even though confiscatory. But that question rests upon mere implications, as no express provision to that effect is pointed out. Moreover, its entire want of merit, not only results from that fact, but from the unwarranted character of the implications upon which it is based. They proceed upon assumptions that, because the city exacted as a condition for consenting to the consolidation, that the existing obligations and duties of the corporations should be preserved, a contract as to the five-cent fare arose. The error of the proposition in all its aspects is equally apparent from a broader view, since from the date of the final decision in the Altgelt Case up to the time when the contention as to confiscation resulting from the changed conditions arose, the acts and dealings of the parties unmistakably indicated the purpose to exert the authority derived from the power to regulate, to the exclusion of the limitations resulting from the right of contract which had been unsuccessfully asserted by the Traction Company in the Altgelt litigation. This deduction arises not only from the exertion by the city, after the finality of the Altgelt litigation, of the power to compel the carrying of policemen and firemen without charge, but also from the general limitations expressed in ordinances making no reference whatever to contract rights, and asserting the right of the city to give or not to give consent to a change of rate.\n In fact, the city ordinance expressing the consent to the consolidation makes this clear, since having, in the second section, imposed upon the Public Service Company 'all the limitations, duties, contracts, forfeitures and obligations imposed on or required of either of said companies at this time,' yet expressly, in the third section, it \n\n[255 U.S. 547, 558]\n\u00a0\n stipulated for the right of the city to regulate the charges for the gas and electric services, and imposed upon the Public Service Company the duty of keeping the accounts as to such services in such a manner as to enable this to be done. Light is necessarily thrown on the purpose of this provision by considering that the right of the Public Service Company to assert that the maximum rates fixed by the ordinance of 1899 in favor of the gas and electric companies were contracts limiting the power of the city to regulate, had not been determined adversely to those companies, as had been done as to the Traction Company by the Altgelt Case-a view the force of which will be felt by recalling that by the amendment to the city's charter which we have stated the constitutional limitation which led to the deflection of the contract clause in the Altgelt Case was no longer applicable.\n The bold contrast between the ordinance feferred to and the statement made by the city in the ordinance refusing the increase in rate to meet the confiscation, because of the assumed restraint put by an existing contract, tends to throw abundant light on the situation. The fact is that all the contentions of the city as to implication of contract as to the 1899 rates but illustrate the plainly erroneous theory upon which the entire argument for the city proceeds; that is, that limitations by contract upon the power of government to regulate the rates to be charged by a public service corporation are to be implied for the purpose of sustaining the confiscation of private property.

Newcomb, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. W. L. Frierson, Sol. Gen., of Chattanooga, Tenn., \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n for the United states.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims denying recovery of taxes paid under the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898 (30 Stat. 448), and amendments, upon certain legacies made under the will of William F. Cochran.\n The facts so far as we deem them material are as follows:\n Cochran died in New York, December 27, 1901, leaving a will and a personal estate of the value of $7,918,027.18 of which appellees and Era S. Cochran were made executors. The latter has since died. The will was probated January 9, 1901, and letters testamentary issued the same date and administration was immediately undertaken and proceeded with without extraordinary or unnecessary delay.\n Six months' notice to creditors was given as required by the law of New York and the time for the presentation of claims expired August 4, 1902. Prior to September 30, 1902, debts and claims against the estate were presented and for the most part paid to the aggregate amount of $98, 589.04, of which amount $66,776.25 were paid prior to July 1, 1902. Expenses of administration during that period had been ascertained to be $ 125,000, of which sum $13,047.16 were paid prior to July 1, 1902. Otherwise claims and expenses of administration had not been ascertained.\n Certain sums were bequeathed to the executors in trust for the children of Cochran and there was also a legacy to a niece and one to a stranger to his blood. Trusts were set up in accordance with the will and the legatees were paid prior to July 1, 1902, the sums provided to be paid. The aggregate payment so made amounted to the sum of $3,140,979.10. \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n In 1892 and 1893 litigation was instituted against the decedent which might involve the estate, it was estimated, in the payment of several hundred thousand dollars or more. The litigation according to the findings of the Court of Claims is still in progress and on account of it money has been retained by the executors that might otherwise have been distributed. The probable outcome of the litigation is not shown.\n Under the laws of New York funds in the hands of executors after the expiration of notice to creditors are liable to after-discovered debts, and legatees who have received money prior to the expiration of such notice are liable up to the amount paid them for claims subsequently presented. The executors were not secured for the payments to legatees prior to July 1, 1902, and prior to that date the value of the residuary estate had not been ascertained.\n In compliance with section 30 of the Act of June 13, 1898, the executors on February 17, 1903, made a return and filed it with the collector of internal revenue giving a schedule of the legacies arising from the personal property of the estate and the amount of tax due thereon. The collector accepted the schedule as correct. The amount paid to him by the executors was the amount they estimated as the amount of the taxes due. The schedule showed the taxes on each legacy and that the total was $158, 321.78, which sum was by the collector paid to the United States.\n July 16, 1904, a demand was made upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the repayment to the executors of the sum paid. After one rejection (October 22, 1910), the Commissioner (March 15, 1915) recommended the claim for allowance in the sum of $107,292.24, and for the rejection of $51,029.54. The recommendation was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The former sum was paid; the latter was not, and remains unrefunded. \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n This sum was computed in respect to the interest of eight different legatees, of which six were residuary legatees, and the computations were made according to certain general rules, tables, and instructions for the use of internal revenue officers, administrators, and trustees in determining the amount of taxes to be paid to the United States upon legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property under the Act of June 13, 1898. There was no special investigation by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the expectancy of life of the several beneficiaries or as to the earning power of the bonds placed in trust for them respectively, and for their benefit.\n The contentions of the parties are quite accurately opposed. The appellees contend that an assessment was a necessary condition to the collection of the taxes, and that there was no assessment until after July 1, 1902, and that on that date the law which established the taxes was repealed.\n In opposition it is urged by the United States that if an assessment was necessary the right to make it was reserved by the repealing act, and that the appellees, as executors, having made a report of the legacies and the taxes thereon, the report and its acceptance by the collector of internal revenue was to all intents and purposes an assessment. It is further urged that, if an assessment was necessary for the purpose of collecting the taxes, it is now immaterial.\n These contentions constitute the issue in the case and depend upon the relation of the law (mostly statutory) to the facts and what it determines. As an element in the determination, the use of the rules of the department and the mortuary tables counsel dismisses from controversy, in concession to Henry v. United States, \n251 U.S. 393\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 185, and Simpson v. United States, \n252 U.S. 547\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 367. The remaining element, that is, the necessity of an assessment prior to July 1, 1902, to the validity of the taxes in question, \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n counsel for appellant says, revolves 'upon the meaning and application of the word 'imposed,' the fifth word in the special saving clause of the repeal act of April 12, 1902.' And counsel defines the word to include all of the steps necessary to the collection of a tax, making it tantamount to 'accrued.' In other words, the contention is that a tax is not 'imposed' by the simple declaration of a law that property shall be subject to it, but 'imposed' only when the tax becomes due and payable, and that the taxes in the present case had not reached that essential condition before July 1, 1902, because they had not been assessed. In support of the contention counsel cites Mason v. Sargent, \n104 U.S. 689\n, and Hertz v. Woodman, \n218 U.S. 205\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 621. There is much in the latter case which, it may be urged, is adverse to the contention, but upon this we are not called upon to pass, for counsel concedes that if a statute imposes a tax in such way as that the amount is readily reduced to a certainty, no assessment is necessary. And this is true of the taxes in question.\n By Section 29 of the Act of June 13, 1898 (30 Stat. 448), legacies or distributive shares such as this case is concerned with1 are made subject to a duty at the rate of 75 cents for each and every $100 of the clear value thereof, and the tax is made a lien and charge for 20 years and its payment required before payment and distribution to the legatees. The section also requires the trustee to make and render to the collector a schedule, list, or statement of the legacies together with the amount of duty that has accrued or shall accrue thereon. Section 30 was amended March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. 938), but no change in anything important to the present controversy. Section 29 and the amendments of March 2, 1901, were repealed by Act of April 12, 1902 (30 Stat. 97 et \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n seq.[Comp. St.  6369]), but it was provided that 'all taxes or duties imposed by section 29 ... and amendments thereof, prior to the taking effect' of the repealing act should 'be subject, as to lien, charge, collection and otherwise, to the provisions of section thirty ... and amendments thereof,' which are hereby 'continued in force.' Except as so continued in force, the repealing statute took effect July 1, 1902\n\n\n The schedule under section 29 was rendered, as we have seen, accepted by the collector, and taxes were paid in accordance therewith in the sum of $158,321.78.\n The schedule included legacies that had been paid after July 1, 1902, but as by Act of June 27, 1902 (32 Stat. 406), such legacies were not subject to a tax, the taxes on them were refunded, upon demand of the executors, but the government refused to refund the taxes on legacies paid prior to that date. This suit was brought for their amount, that is, the sum of $51,029.54.\n To support recovery, it is contended that there was no obligation of payment, because, as has already been said, the amount to be paid was not made certain by assessment, or, to quote counsel, was not 'so certain (or capable of such ascertainment) that reasonable minds could not disagree, and that the exercise of judgment and the consideration and weighing of evidence could not affect the result.' For this Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 663, and other cases are cited and reviewed.\n But we cannot agree that there was uncertainty. We have seen the amount of taxes imposed by the statute was definite and the appellants had no trouble in estimating and returning the value of the legacies upon which it was imposed. The basis of the claim of uncertainty is that the estate was and is not settled and that there is a possibility that the legatees may be called upon to pay debts. The contention is as strained and baseless as that rejected in Simpson v. United States, supra. \n\n[254 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n It is to be remembered, besides, that the case does not present a case of resistance to the payment of a tax, but of the recovery of taxes voluntarily paid, and that therefore the illegality of them should be shown not only by averment, but by proof, not, as it is attempted to be, by assertion and speculation. It is true that it is averred that prior to July 1, 1902, the amount of claims against the estate had not been ascertained, and that there was responsibility upon the trustees and legatees to make a return of the whole or ratable portions of the legacies to the extent that the sums remaining in the estate should be insufficient to satisfy all valied claims. It is conceded, however, the contingency of this might have terminated August 1, 1902, and while it is averred that the clear value of the interests of the legatees was at all times prior to July 1, 1902, uncertain and indefinite, and still is so, there stand in opposition the facts of the case and the refutation that an estate of the net personal value of nearly $8,000,000 was or is in danger of embarrassment by the payment of legacies of less than $1,000,000. And we have seen that the executors, who had knowledge of the condition of the estate, and all that it might be made subject to, did not hesitate to make a return of the legacies to the collector of internal revenue and pay the taxes thereon. The petition in this case was filed in the Court of Claims June 23, 1916, 14 years after the commencement of the administration of the estate and nearly as long after the time of presentation of claims against it, and the record shows that the total of the claims and expenses of administration, including funeral expenses, amount to the sum of $235, 700. In the fact of this exhibition we are asked to speculate upon possibility of the existence of liabilities that 14 years have not developed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We disregard a distinction in the legacies as not important to the argument. \n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRESCENT COTTON OIL CO. v.

A penalty is provided for violation of the act, but corporations are permitted to operate their gins for a reasonable time until they may be sold. A proviso \n\n[257 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n permits cotton seed oil companies to operate gins of a prescribed capacity, but only in the city or town where their oil plants are located. Laws Miss. 1914, c. 162, section 4752 et seq., Hemingway's Code 1917\n\n\n The plaintiff in error, a corporation organized under Tennessee laws, prior to 1914 owned and operated a cotton seed oil mill at Memphis in that state, and two cotton gins in Mississippi. Disregarding the Anti-Gin Act, it continued to operate its two gins in Mississippi until October, 1915, when, for the purpose of enforcing the law, the state, on the relation of its Attorney General, instituted a suit in equity against the company in a county court of chancery, which, after various vicissitudes, resulted in a decree that the act was constitutional, and that the plaintiff in error was guilty of violating it. A penalty was imposed upon the company, its right to do intrastate or local business in Mississippi was declared forfeited, it was perpetually enjoined from operating cotton gins in the state, and it was ordered that, within 90 days, the company should dispose of the two cotton gins which it owned and operated in Mississippi. The company was also found guilty of violating the anti-trust law of the state and a penalty therefor was imposed.\n This is a proceeding in error to review the decree of the Supreme Court of Mississippi affirming that decree of the county court as to the Anti-Gin Act. The holding that the anti-trust laws were violated was reversed by the Supreme Court.\n Without proof of it in the record, the case is argued upon the assumption that the statute assailed was enacted in aid of the antitrust laws of the state, under the conviction on the part of the Legislature that it was the practice of corporations operating oil mills and cotton gins to depress the price of ginning, regardless of cost, until local competition was suppressed, or brought to terms, and then to charge excessive prices for ginning and to pay \n\n[257 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n unfairly low prices for seed. There is evidence in the record tending to show resort to such methods by the plaintiff in error.\n It clearly appears that in practice it is an advantage to the purchaser of cotton seed to operate gins, not only for the profit that may be made from them directly, but because the grower of cotton often prefers to sell his seed to the company ginning it rather than carry it to another purchaser. It is also in evidence that individuals, as well as corporations owned and operated gins and that other oil companies than the plaintiff in error obtained their supplies of seed from growers, from gin owners, and from brokers.\n The plaintiff in error has heretofore relied, and here relies, for its defense, upon the unconstitutionality of the Anti-Gin Act, which it asserts upon two grounds, viz. first, that, as applied to the plaintiff in error, it imposes a direct and substantial, and therefore an unconstitutional, burden upon an instrumentality of interstate commerce; and, second, mildly, that, the act being applicable to corporations, and not to individuals, owning and operating cotton gins, it denies to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws, and therefore offends against the Constitution of the United States.\n The basis of the first contention is the claim that it had become impracticable for the oil company to carry on its oil manufacturing business successfully when purchasing its cotton seed supply from other ginners or from brokers, that for this reason the company acquired its two cotton gins in Mississippi, and nine in other states, to obtain the advantage of purchasing seed direct from the growers of cotton, and that all of the cotton seed which it had purchased in connection with its gins was shipped in interstate commerce to its oil mill at Memphis, the gins being, in effect, 'feeders' to its oil mill.\n These facts, not disputed in the record, it is argued, constitute the gins an essential means and instrumentality of \n\n[257 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce and that therefore the act imposes a direct and unconstitutional burden on commerce between the states, in violation of section 8 of article 1, of the Constitution of the United States.\n Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190, Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232, Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n216 U.S. 146\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 280, and Harrison v. St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Co., \n232 U.S. 318\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 333, L. R. A. 1915F, 1187, are relied upon to sustain this contention of the plaintiff in error. In the first two of the cases cited an attempt was made by the state of Kansas to tax interstate carriers on the basis of all of their property, wherever situated, as measured by the capital stock of the companies. In the third case a similar attempt was made by the state of Arkansas.\n There was no question in any of these cases but that the principal business of the companies challenging the taxing law was interstate in character and that their chief investment was in property used in and necessary to the conduct of their interstate commerce. The controversy in the cases was as to the incidence of the tax-whether it was so imposed upon the property of the companies or the stock representing it, as to constitute a direct and substantial burden upon the interstate commerce in which they were engaged.\n It is clear that these decisions cannot be of aid in determining the question we are now considering, which is whether a cotton gin operated by an oil company in Mississippi is rendered an instrumentality of interstate commerce by the fact that the owner of it ships out of the state, for its use in another state, all of the cotton seed which may be purchased in connection with its ginning operations.\n The fourth case relied upon, Harrison v. St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Co., \n232 U.S. 318\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 333, L. R. A. 1915F, 1187, was an attempt on the part of a state to prevent removal of causes from state to United States courts, and is, if possible, yet more inapposite.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n The separation of the seed from the fiber of the cotton, which is accomplished by the use of the cotton gin, is a short, but important, step in the manufacture of both the seed and the fiber into useful articles of commerce; but that manufacture is not commerce was held in Kidd v.

Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475; New York Central, etc., Co. v. Mohney, \n252 \nU.S. 152, 155\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 9 A. L. R. 496. When the ginning is completed, the operator of the gin is free to purchase the seed or not, and, if it is purchased, to store it in Mississippi indefinitely, or to sell or use it in that state, or to ship it out of the state for use in another, and, under the cases cited, it is only in this last case, and after the seed has been committed to a carrier for interstate transport, that it passes from the regulatory power of the state into interstate commerce and under the national power.\n The application of these conclusions of law to the manufacturing operations of the cotton gins, which we have seen precede, but are not a part of, interstate commerce, renders it quite impossible to consider them an instrumentality of such commerce, which is burdened by the Anti-Gin Act, and the first contention of the plaintiff in error must be denied.\n There remains the second contention, that the Anti-Gin Act denies to plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws, because it applies to corporations and not to individuals. \n\n[257 U.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n Where, as we have found in this case, a foreign corporation has no federal right to continue to do business in a state, and where, as here, no contract right is involved, and there is no employment by the federal government, it is the settled law that a state may impose conditions, in its discretion, upon the right of such a corporation to do business within the state, even to the extent of excluding it altogether. Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 403; Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 83\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 15, and cases cited. And in such case the inherent difference between corporations and natural persons is sufficient to sustain a classification making restrictions applicable to corporations only. Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, \n212 \nU.S. 322, 343\n, 344 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 370, 15 Ann. Cas. 645; Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 83\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 15. And see Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v.

Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 423.\n This would be sufficient to dispose of this second contention, but we may add that the law assailed was enacted by the state in the exercise of its police power, to prevent a practice conceived to be promotive of monopoly with its attendant evils. It is clearly settled that any classification adopted by a state in the exercise of this power which has a reasonable basis, and is therefore not arbitrary, will be sustained against an attack based upon the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also that every state of facts sufficient to sustain such classification which can be reasonably conceived of as having existed when the law was enacted will be assumed. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160, and cases cited; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 U.S. 342\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 370, L. R.

Cas. 1917B, 455. \n\n[257 U.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n The record before us shows that, before the law assailed was enacted, cotton gins had been operated in Mississippi by individuals as well as by corporations; but there is no showing that oil mills and cotton gins were both operated by an individual or by groups of individuals, and we think it may well be assumed, under the rule stated, that because of the larger capital required, and perhaps for other reasons, oil mills and cotton gins may have been operated in that state only by corporations, and that for this reason the restraint of the evil aimed at by the act of the Legislature could be accomplished by controlling corporations only. Assuming this to be the fact when the law was enacted, obviously the classification objected to cannot be pronounced so without reasonable basis as to be arbitrary.\n A number of minor contentions are discussed in the briefs. These have all been considered, but are found to be not of sufficient substance to deserve special discussion.\n It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi will be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCULPEPPER v.

Allen, and Eugene A. Kingman, all of Providence, R. I., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought by a receiver of a national bank to recover from former directors of the bank for losses sustained by it because of dividends paid out of capital and improper loans and investments made by the defendants. The bill states with particularity the dates at which each defendant began and ceased to serve, and thus discloses that six of those named left office more than six years before August 2, 1916, when this suit was begun. On motion the bill was dismissed by the District Court as against these six on the ground that the statute of limitations of the State of Rhode Island was a bar. 259 Fed. 961, sub nom. Curtis v. Metcalf. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 264 Fed. 650. The receiver appeals, contending that the bill states facts sufficient to suspend the running of the statute until within six years from the beginning of the suit. \n\n[257 U.S. 260, 262]\n\u00a0\n There is no dispute that the statute of Rhode Island governs the case. McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 U.S. 154\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 410, 3 Ann. Cas. 500. The only question argued is whether the bill brings the defendants within the exception to the general rule, in Gen. Laws 1969, c. 284,  7:\n'If any person, liable to an action by another shall fraudulently, by actual misrepresentation, conceal from him the existence of the cause of such action, said cause of action shall be deemed to accrue against the person so liable therefor, at the time when the person entitled to sue thereon shall first discover its existence.'\n\n The misrepresentations charged are having the books and financial statements of the bank so kept and made as to show at their face value loans and investments known to be improper or worthless and thus to conceal the impairment of the capital fof the bank. These books were exhibited to the examiners and reports thus falsely made were filed with the Comptroller of the Currency and published, and none of the facts was discovered by any other than the directors before 1913, and many of them not until the latter part of 1915. The overstatement of assets is alleged to have grown from $50,000 in 1906 to $700,000 in 1913, when the bank was found to be insolvent and was put into the hands of a receiver. It is laid at $150,000 on January 12, 1909, when three of the appellees ceased to be directors; and when the other three left on January 11, 1910, at probably more than $200,000. The bank was then still solvent. The appellant says that these facts bring the case within the above section 7, and that no discovery of them appears until after August 3, 1910, that is, until within six years of this suit.\n This suit is brought upon the common law right of the bank to recover for acts that diminished its assets. Therefore the question is whether the bank's claim is barred. The bank of course must be charged with knowledge of \n\n[257 U.S. 260, 263]\n\u00a0\n what appeared upon its books. It owned them; its stockholders had a right to inspect them. Guthrie v. Harkness, \n199 U.S. 148\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 4, 4 Ann. Cas. 466. Hence it would seem, as suggested by the District Judge, that so far as concerns investments of a kind that national banks are not allowed to make, the bank was chargeable with knowledge from the beginning and can found no claim upon them now. The parties to whom loans were made and the specific character of the assets must also have been known at all times, so that the only misrepresentations were those concerning the credit of the debtors implied by entering the claims at their face value in the books and reports. It is said that these were continuing representations, and no doubt the documents still read as they did when written. Whether they can be regarded as looking to an indefinite future reliance upon them or can be taken to have been relied upon for more than a short time except as to the belief of the directors at the moment is a different matter. The reports at least were superseded by later reports each of which imported a judgment as to then present values, not as to past.\n The question, therefore, is narrowed to the entries on the books, and as to these again as suggested by the District Judge, it is to be remembered that credits and the value of business paper or securities are variable. Many of those said to be overvalued were for short terms. Most of the renewals are stated to have been new extensions of credit-that is new judgments on present responsibility, superseding the old. We agree with the courts below that the valuations on the books cannot be regarded as continuing in an effective sense. Three new directors came upon the board before August 3, 1910. It is alleged unmistakably in the bill that all the directors were chargeable with notice and did in fact know that the dividends were paid out of assets and not earned and that the improper \n\n[257 U.S. 260, 264]\n\u00a0\n loans should be recalled. Even if otherwise the statute of limitations would not have run, which we do not imply, knowledge of the facts by the new directors was knowledge by the bank, and none the less that according to the bill they in their turn were unfaithful. It is not alleged that they conspired with the defendants whose case we are considering. They came to the board as the eyes of the bank. Any one of them having notice was bound to do what he could to avert or diminish the loss. Indeed the bill seeks to charge one of them for not having done his duty. Notice to an officer, in the line of his duty, was notice to the bank. A single director like a single stockholder could proceed in the courts. Joint Stock Discount Co. v. Brown, L. R. 8 Eq. 381, 403.\n The counsel for the plaintiff seemed to take the bill as admitting less than we have said in the way of knowledge. We are unable to read it otherwise than as we have indicated, but even if knowledge on the part of the new directors were not expressly charged, it was their business and duty in the year and seven months from the resignation of the first three to August 3, 1910, or the seven months after the resignation of the second three to the same date, to get some notion of the credits and assets of the bank. It does not appear that there would have been any difficulty in ascertaining at least enough to lead to further inquiry if they had. See Wood v. Carpenter, \n101 U.S. 135\n. The statute of limitations must not be applied so narrowly that business men will be afraid to take directorships, and however this bill be read in its details it appears to us not to charge enough to deprive the appellees of the protection of the act. It is said that they stood in a fiduciary relation to the bank. But they were strangers to it when they left the board, more than six years before this suit was brought. We see no reason why the statute should not apply. See Emerson v. Gaither, \n\n[257 U.S. 260, 265]\n\u00a0\n 103 Md. 564, 64 Atl. 26, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 738, 7 Ann. Cas. 1114; Boyd v.

BONDURANT(1921)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: October 10, 1921\n\n\nDecided. Dec. 12, 1921.\n\n\n - \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John C. Dollan, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. Walton Hendry, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover damages for the breach of a contract for the sale and delivery of a crop of wheat estimated at 14,000 bushels. The plaintiff was a Tennessee corporation engaged in operating a flour and feed mill at Union City, in that state. The defendant was a resident of Hickman, Ky., and extensively engaged in farming in that vicinity. They were the parties to the contract. It was made at Hickman and the wheat was to be delivered and paid for there. But the delivery was to be on board the cars of a common carrier, and the plaintiff intended to ship the wheat to its mill in Tennessee. A small part of the crop was delivered as agreed, but delivery of the rest was refused, although the plaintiff was prepared and expecting to receive and pay for it. A payment advanced on the crop more than covered what was delivered. At the time for delivery wheat had come to be worth several cents per bushel more than the price fixed by the contract. The action was brought in a state court in Kentucky.\n The principal defense interposed-the only one which we have occasion to notice-was to the effect that the plaintiff had not complied, as was the fact, with a statute of Kentucky (Ky. Stats. 1915,  571) prescribing the conditions on which corporations of other states might do business in that state, and that the contract was therefore not enforceable. To this the plaintiff replied that the only business done by it in Kentucky consisted in purchasing \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n wheat and other grain in that state for immediate shipment to its Tennessee mill and then shipping the same there; that the contract in question was made in the course of this business and with the purpose of forwarding the wheat to the mill as soon as it was delivered on board the cars; that this transaction was in interstate commerce, and as to it the statute of Kentucky whose application was invoked by the defendant was invalid because in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n The cause was tried twice. On the first trial the plaintiff obtained a verdict and judgment, the court ruling that the statute could not constitutionally be applied to the transaction in question. But the Court of Appeals of the state, while conceding the invalidity of the statute as respects transactions in interstate commerce, held the transaction in question was not in such commerce, declared the statute valid and properly enforceable as to that transaction, and reversed the judgment with a direction for a new trial. That court proceeded on the theory that, as the contract was made in Kentucky, related to property then in that state, and was to be wholly performed therein, the transaction was strictly intrastate, and not within the reach or protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States; and this although the wheat was to be delivered on board the cars of a public carrier and the plaintiff intended to ship it to Tennessee as soon at it was so delivered. Bondurant v. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co., 175 Ky. 774, 195 S. W. 139. On the second trial a verdict for the defendant was directed because the plaintiff had not complied with the statute. The jury conformed to the direction, judgment was entered on the verdict, and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on the authority of its former decision. 185 Ky. 386, 215 S. W. 76.\n The case is here on a writ of error and our jurisdiction is challenged. The objection is not that we are without \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n power to review the judgment, but that it can be reviewed only on a writ of certiorari. The controlling statute is section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 ( Comp. St.  1214). Besides confining our power of review in cases litigated in the state courts to those in which the decision of a federal question is involved, this jurisdictional section provides that the review in cases falling within certain classes may be on writ of error and in others on writ of certiorari, the distinguishing or dividing line being drawn according to the nature of the federal question and the way in which the state court decides it. Some cases may fall on both sides of the line. But with this we are not now concerned. Among those in which the review may be on writ of error the section includes--\n'any suit ... where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.'\n\n Among those in which the review may be on writ of certiorari are--\n'any cause ... where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is against their validity,' and 'any cause ... where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is either in favor of or against the title, right, privilege or immunity especially set up or claimed, by either party, under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission, or authority.'\n\n In the state court the plaintiff did not simply claim a right or immunity under the Constitution of the United \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n States, but distinctly insisted that as to the transaction in question the Kentucky statute was void, and therefore unenforceable, because in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution. The court did not accede to the insistence, but applied and enforced the statute. Of course, that was an affirmation of its validity when so applied. Bridge Proprietors v. Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 116, 144; McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 116\n, 117 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 134; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211, 228\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 475; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427, 432\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 325. And see Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 27 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 190. The case is therefore of the class described in the first of the provisions which we have quoted from the jurisdictional section. That the statute was not claimed to be invalid in toto and for every purpose does not matter. A statute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another. Poindexter v. Greenhow, \n114 \nU.S. 270, 295\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 903, 962; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Wynne, \n224 U.S. 354\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 493, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 102; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Anderson, \n233 U.S. 325\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 599. Besides, a litigant can be heard to question a statute's validity only when and so far as it is being or is about to be applied to his disadvantage. Yazoo & Mississippi R. R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 U.S. 217\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 40; Jeffrey Manufacturing Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167. Neither does it matter on what ground the court upheld and enforced the statute. The provisions quoted from the jurisdictional section show that in cases where the validity of a state statute is drawn in question because of the alleged repugnance to the Constitution the mode of review depends on the way in which the state court resolves the question. If it be resolved in favor of the validity of the statute, the review may be on writ of error; and if it be resolved against the validity the review can only be on writ of certiorari. The provisions take no account of the particular grounds or reasons on which the decision is put. \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n It is loosely said in one of the briefs for the plaintiff that the 'sole question for decision' is whether the contract was a part of interstate commerce; but we attach no importance to this, because it not only is said in the same brief that the plaintiff 'maintained in the state court, and it maintains here, that the Kentucky statute, as construed and applied in this case by the state court, is unconstitutional under the commerce clause,' but much of that brief and of another is devoted to an effort to show the invalidity of the statute in that regard.\n Our conclusion on the jurisdictional question is that, as the state court applied and enforced to the plaintiff's disadvantage a state statute which the plaintiff seasonably insisted as so applied and enforced was repugnant to the Constitution and void, the case is rightly here on writ of error. Like rulings on like grounds will be found in Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 265\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 101, and United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 277\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 105.\n The commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) expressly commits to Congress and impliedly withholds from the several states the power to regulate commerce among the latter. Such commerce is not confined to transportation from one state to another, but comprehends all commercial intercourse between different states and all the component parts of that intercourse. Where goods in one state are transported into another for purposes of sale, the commerce does not end with the transportation, but embraces as well the sale of the goods after they reach their destination and while they are in the original packages. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446-447; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500, 519\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 365. On the same principle, where goods are purchased in one state for transportation to another, the commerce includes the purchase quite as much as it does the transportation. American Express Co. v. Iowa, \n196 \nU.S. 133, 143\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 182. This has been recognized in many decisions \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n construing the commerce clause. Thus it was said in Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 280:\n\"Commerce' is a term of the largest import. It comprehends intercourse for the purposes of trade in any and all its forms, including the transportation, purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities.'\n\n In Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 6, 10 (32 L. Ed. 346), it was tersely said:\n'Buying and selling and the transportation incidental thereto constitute commerce.'\n\n In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 254, (39 L. Ed. 325), 'contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be transported among the several states' were declared 'part of interstate trade or commerce.' And in Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 241\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 96, 107 (44 L. Ed. 136), the court referred to the prior decisions as establishing that--\n'Interstate commerce consists of intercourse and traffic between the citizens or inhabitants of different states, and includes not only the transportation of persons and property and the navigation of public waters for that purpose, but also the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities.'\n\n In on case has the court made any distinction between buying and selling or between buying for transportation to another state and transporting for sale in another state Quite to the contrary, the import of the decisions has been that, if the transportation was incidental to buying or selling, it was not material whether it came first or last.\n A corporation of one state may go into another, without obtaining the leave or license of the latter, for all the legitimate purposes of such commerce; and any statute of the latter state which obstructs or lays a burden on the exercise of this privilege is void under the commerce clause. Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 57\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 851; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 190; International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 112\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 U.S. 197\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 57.\n There is no controversy about the facts bearing on the character of the transaction in question. It had been the \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 292]\n\u00a0\n practice of the plaintiff to go into Kentucky to purchase grain to be transported to and used in its mill in Tennessee. On different occasions it had purchased from the defendant-at one time 13,000 bushels of corn. This contract was made in continuance of that practice the plaintiff intending to forward the grain to its mill as soon as the delivery was made. In keeping with that purpose the delivery was to be on board the cars of a public carrier. Applying to these facts the principles before stated, we think the transaction was in interstate commerce. The state court, stressing the fact that the contract was made in Kentucky and was to be performed there put aside the further facts that the delivery was to be on board the cars and that the plaintiff, in continuance of its prior practice, was purchasing the grain for shipment to its mill in Tennessee. We think the facts so neglected had a material bearing and should have been considered. They showed that what otherwise seemed an intrastate transaction was a part of interstate commerce. See Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 276; Reading Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 324, 367\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 90; Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Mining Co., \n238 U.S. 456\n-468, 35 Sup. Ct. 986; Eureka Pipe Line Co v. Hallanan, supra. The state court also attached some importance to the fact that after the grain was delivered on the cars the plaintiff might have changed its mind and have sold the grain at the place of delivery or have shipped it to another point in Kentucky. No doubt this was possible, but it also was improbable. With equal basis it could be said that a shipment of merchandise billed to a point beyond the state of its origin might be halted by the shipper in the exercise of the right of stoppage in transitu before it got out of that state. The essential character of the transaction as otherwise fixed is not changed by a mere possibility of that sort. See United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, supra.\n For these reasons we are of opinion that the transaction was a part of interstate commerce, in which the planitiff \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 293]\n\u00a0\n lawfully could engage without any permission from the state of Kentucky, and that the statute in question, which concededly imposed burdensome conditions, was as to that transaction invalid because repugnant to the commerce clause.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n The writ of error should, in my opinion, be dismissed. The obstacle to our assuming jurisdiction is not procedural, as it is in those cases where a plaintiff fails because the claim was not made seasonably or in appropriate form. \n1\n Here the obstacle is the nature of the constitutional question sought to be reviewed. It involves a state statute. But the validity of the statute is not actually drawn in question. Only the propriety of the application or use of the statute is questioned. Since the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726, such questions are not reviewable in this court as of right. They may now be reviewed only in the court's discretion; and exercise of the discretion must be invoked by a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n This court has now, as it had before that act, jurisdiction under section 237 of the Judicial Code to review a final judgment of the highest court of a state whenever a right under the federal Constitution duly claimed has been denied in applying a state statute. And in no case involving a state statute can jurisdiction attach unless the statute has been applied. For, unless it was applied, there could not have been an invasion of the party's constitutional right; and, unless there was such invasion, the constitutional \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 294]\n\u00a0\n question presented, whatever its nature, would be moot. But the act of 1916 made the nature of the constitutional question raised in applying the statute a matter of importance. If the question is a denial of the power of the Legislature to enact the statute as construed, a review may be had as of right. If the question concerns merely the propriety of the particular use of the statute or of the manner of applying or administering it the review may be had only in this court's discretion. The classification thus introduced rests upon broad considerations of policy. The steady increase of the business of this court had made it necessary to limit the appellate jurisdiction in cases arising under section 237. To this end Congress determined in 1916 that even cases involving constitutional questions should be reviewed here only where the public interest appeared to demand it. Congress left parties a review as of right where the validity of a state statute had been drawn in question; because the decision of such a question is usually a matter of general interest. But whether a valid state statute has in a particular case been so used as to violate a constitutional guaranty is ordinarily a matter of merely private interest. Hence Congress provided that, where the validity of the statute is not assailed, the denial of a claim that in applying it a right, privilege, or immunity had been violated should not be reviewed, unless this court, in its discretion to be exercised upon petition for a writ of certiorari, should direct the review; that is, Congress treated a right, privilege, or immunity claimed to have been violated by the courts' erroneously applying a confessedly valid statute to the particular facts of a case just as it treated a claim that the right, privilege, or immunity had been violated by a decision erroneous in some other respect.\n In considering whether in this case the validity of the state statute was drawn in question, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in every case involving a statute, the state \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 295]\n\u00a0\n court must perform (aside from the consideration of any constitutional questions) two functions essentially different. First the court must construe the statute; that is, determine its meaning and scope. Then it must apply the statute, as so construed, to the facts of the case. \n2\n In this case the construction of the statute was never in controversy. It had been settled by earlier decisions that the statute referred only to corporations when transacting business in intrastate commerce. Here the only controversy concerned the character of the particular transaction to which defendant sought to have the statute applied. Was it interstate commerce? If so, the transaction was not within the scope of the statute. To decide that controversy two determinations had to be made. One was of fact-whether the wheat was sold and bought for shipment to Tennessee. The other was of law-whether the fact that the wheat was so sold and bought makes the transaction one in interstate commerce. Did that controversy over the character of the commerce draw in question the validity of the statute or did it draw in question merely the propriety, that is, the constitutionality, of its application? What the character of the controversy was must be decided upon the record presented here.\n The validity of a statute as was said in Baltimore & Potomac R. R. Co. v. Hopkins, \n130 \nU.S. 210, 224\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 503, 507 (32 L. Ed. 908), is drawn in question whenever the power to enact it 'as it is by its terms or is made to read by construction, is fairly open to denial and denied.' The power to enact \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 296]\n\u00a0\n section 571, Kentucky Statutes, as construed by the highest court of the state, was not fairly open to denial; for the statute was construed as affecting only intrastate transactions of foreign corporations. See International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 U.S. 91\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103; Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 207. A writ of error which rested solely upon the challenge of the statute so construed would have presented no substantial claim and must have been dismissed as frivolous. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Brown, \n187 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 123; Sugarman v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 182, 184\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 191. Compare Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., \n252 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 385. Nor was the power to enact section 571 as construed actually denied. The question decided below and presented for review here is merely whether this valid statute has been so used-not construed-as to deny to the plaintiff a privilege or immunity guaranteed by the federal Constitution.\n That the character of the commerce-and not the validity of the statute-was the only question actually in controversy and is the only question which the plaintiff actually seeks to present for review appears from the following statement in its brief filed in this court, as well as from the supporting argument:\n'The sole question for decision by this court is whether the contract sued on is a part of interstate commerce or purely a transaction in intrastate commerce. If this court should conclude that the contract is any part of interstate commerce, the judgment of the Kentucky Court of Appeals must be reversed; otherwise it should be affirmed.'\n\n A party's conception or characterization of the question presented by the record is, of course, not conclusive of his right to a review. The right is determined by the record. But in this case the record confirms the plaintiff's conception of the question submitted for review. The judgment of the Court of Appeals brought before us is that of October 17, 1919, which affirmed the judgment below entered \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 297]\n\u00a0\n after the second trial before a jury. In 1917 the Court of Appeals, in delivering its first opinion which directed the second trial (Bondurant v. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co., 175 Ky. 774, 195 S. W. 139), said:\n'This court has heretofore held that section 571, supra, does not have any application to a foreign corporation which is engaged strictly in interstate commerce with citizens of this state. ... Hence, if the contract sought to be enforced was an interstate commerce transaction, the failure to comply with section 571, supra, would not affect the right of appellee to sue and recover upon its contract, but, if it was an intrastate business, the failure to have complied with section 571, supra, is fatal to appellee's right of recovery. ... So the question for decision is: Was the contract between appellant and appellee one which is protected by article 1, c. 8, par. 3, of the federal Constitution, from regulation by the state of Kentucky, as being a transaction in interstate commerce?'\n\n Since 1903 it had been the settled law of the state, as then declared by its highest court, that section 571 did not affect transactions in interstate commerce, Commonwealth v. Hogan, McMorrow & Tieke Co. (Ky.) 74 S. W. 737.3 Thus, before this action was begun, it was the settled law that such transactions of foreign corporations were not within the scope of the statute. In 1915, after this action was begun, but before the first trial, that rule was again applied in Louisville Trust Co. v. Bayer Co., 166 Ky. 744, 746, 179 S. W. 1034. When, therefore, this case was before the Circuit Court at the second trial and when it was before the Court of Appeals for the second time, there clearly was no actual controversy over the validity of the statute. It \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 298]\n\u00a0\n is true that plaintiff had used in pleading language which imported not only a claim of immunity because the transaction was interstate commerce, but also an assertion that section 571, if construed so as to affect it, was invalid. But a review by this court as of right cannot be acquired by inaccurately describing, or by disguising, the nature of the constitutional claim actually made. Nor could there have been a conscious purpose to do this when the reply was filed. In 1915 the exact nature of the claim under the Constitution was not material. At that time the denial of any claim of constitutional right, whatever its nature, still gave the party a review in this court as of right. It was the Act of September 6, 1916, which made the division of cases involving constitutional questions into two classes a matter of substance.\n If jurisdiction upon writ of error can be obtained by the mere claim in words that a state statute is invalid, if so construed as to 'apply' to a given state of facts, the right to a review will depend, in large classes of cases, not upon the nature of the constitutional question involved, but upon the skill of counsel. The result would be particularly regrettable, because the decision of such cases often depends, not upon the determination of important questions of law (which should in the main engage the attention of this court), but upon the appreciation of evidence frequently voluminous. Thus, in proceedings under state Workmen's Compensation Acts or state Employers' Liability Acts, the question whether a carrier is liable depends often upon the question whether at the time of the accident the employee was engaged in interstate or in intrastate commerce. Since the Act of September 6, 1916, certiorari is the proper means of reveiwing a judgment involving that question. Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial Commission, \n251 U.S. 259\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 130, 10 A. L. R. 1181. If the rule now insisted upon obtains, the carrier could in every such case secure a review on writ of error by simply claiming \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 299]\n\u00a0\n that the state statute is invalid under the commerce clause if construed so as to apply to the special facts of the case. Yet it was pre-eminently the decision of the questions like these from which Congress sought to relieve this court by the act of September 6, 1916.4 Likewise in cases involving state taxation the validity of the tax often depends upon the question whether the specific thing taxed was property within or property without the taxing state-a question which, as held in Dana v. Dana, \n250 U.S. 220\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 449, and Anderson v. Durr, \n257 U.S. 99\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 15, can be reviewed here only on writ of certiorari. If the rule now insisted upon should prevail, jurisdiction in such cases could be secured on writ of error by the simple device of claiming that the taxing statute is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment if construed so as to apply to the specific property involved. So, in suits jin state courts against foreign corporations, the question whether there is jurisdiction depends often upon the question whether the corporation was doing business within the state and had expressly or impliedly consented to be used there. \n5\n The correctness of the decision of a state court of this question has been held to be reviewable here only upon certiorari. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58. But, if the rule now insisted upon \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 300]\n\u00a0\n should prevail, jurisdiction on writ of error may be secured by simply making the claim that the state statute is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment if construed so as to apply to the facts of the case.\n Plaintiff relies upon a number of cases, assumed to be similar, in which, after the Act of September 6, 1916, jurisdiction was (mainly without discussion) taken on writ of error. They are not in point. In some of them orders of railroad commissions were challenged as violating the Constitution. \n6\n Such an order, unlike decisions of courts, being legislative in its nature and made by an instrumentality of the state, is a state law within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress regulating our jurisdiction. Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n249 \nU.S. 422, 424\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 345, 346 (63 L. Ed. 684). In each of these cases, therefore, attacking the validity of the order was drawing in question the validity of a law. In others the validity of state statutes as construed was actually drawn in question. \n7\n McGinis v. California, \n247 U.S. 91\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 440, and McGinis v. California, \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 301]\n\u00a0\n \n247 U.S. 95\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 441, involved, like the case at bar, the determination whether the transaction in question was one in interstate or foreign commerce. Although they did not draw in question the validity of any statute, this court properly entertained the writ of error in each of those cases, because, as the original records disclose, the judgment was of a date so early as not to come within the Act of September 6, 1916. It is true that section 237 of the Judicial Code, which re- enacted section 709 of the Revised Statutes, and section 2 of the Act of February 5, 1967, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, 386, used, in defining the jurisdiction of this court, the phrase 'where is drawn in question the validity of a statute.' But under none of these acts could there be occasion for deciding the question here under discussion; for each contained also the more comprehensive provision giving jurisdiction where any right, title, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution had been denied. And under section 25 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 85, which embodied the law prior to 1867, the conditions were substantially the same. Hence little help can be derived from the consideration of cases involving judgments entered before the Act of September 9, 1916, became effective. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[257 U.S. 282, 302]\n\u00a0\n Nor can we be aided in construing the Act of September 6, 1916, by considering cases arising under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1215), re-enacting section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827, as amended. For the third clause thereof empowers this court to review by writ of error or appeal decisions of United States District Courts 'in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.' This comprehensive provision renders immaterial in this connection the nature of the constitutional question. The specification in the fourth clause of cases 'in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States ... is drawn in question,' and in the fifth clause of cases 'in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States,' adds nothing. Nor can we derive aid from cases involving review by this court of cases coming from the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218), re- enacting section 6 of the act, 26 Stat. 826, 828. For under it the right of review where available exists regardless of the nature of the constitutional question.\n But cases coming from the District of Columbia and from the territories in which a review by this court was sought (under the Act of March 3, 1885, c. 355, 23 Stat. 443 [Comp. St.  1222], and under section 250 of the Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1227]), on the ground that the validity of an authority or of a statute was drawn in question, are persuasive as to the meaning of the phrase drawing in question the validity of a statute, as used in the Act of 1916. And they were recognized in Ireland v. Woods, \n246 \nU.S. 323, 329\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 319, as controlling. Thus United States ex rel. Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 U.S. 445\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 329; and United States ex rel. Foreman v. Meyer, \n227 U.S. 452\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 331, hold that the validity of an authority is not drawn in question where the controversy is confined to determining whether the facts upon which a person can \n\n[257 U.S. 282, 303]\n\u00a0\n exercise that authority do or do not exist; and the writs of error were dismissed because the validity was not 'drawn in question' in the sense in which that phrase is used in the statute; that is, brought forward or made a ground of decision. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It is, of course, permissible to make the claim that a statute is invalid, and also that, as administered or applied, it violates a right or immunity under the Constitution. In such a case the writ of error is clearly appropriate. But in the case at bar there never has been a real claim that the statute as construed by the highest court of Kentucky is invalid. The actual claim was and is that a confessedly valid statute was misapplied, and thereby a constitutional guaranty was violated. A review as of right is not to be obtained by misdescribing the question in controversy. When Congress declared that there should be a review as of right only where the validity of the statute was drawn in question, it did not provide for securing the right by the use of a form of words-a potent formula which should operate as an 'open sesame.' It was dealing with substance. It legislated to relieve an overburdened court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Jett Bros. Co. v. Carrollton, \n252 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 40 S. Sup.

Ct. 116. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The word 'apply' is used in connection with statutes in two senses. When construing a statute, in describing the class of persons, things or functions which are within its scope; as that the statute does not 'apply' to transactions in interstate state commerce. When discussing the use made of a statute, in referring to the process by which the statute is made operative; as where the jury is told to 'apply' the statute of limitation if they find that the cause of action arose before a given date. In this opinion it is used in the latter sense. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, also, Ryman Steamboat Line Co. v. Commonwealth, 125 Ky. 253, 101 S. W. 403, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1187; Commonwealth v.

JACKSON(1921)\nNo. 720\nArgued: April 15, 1921Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 589, 590]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Philip Nichols, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 589, 594]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Harold Hitchcock, of Boston, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this proceeding we are asked to review and reverse a judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, holding valid an act of the General Court (General Acts 1919, c. 314), providing for the distribution of the proceeds of an income tax among the towns, cities and taxing districts of that state, against the contention that it violates the due process and equal protection of the law \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 595]\n\u00a0\n clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n By amendment to the Constitution of Massachusetts, approved by the people in 1915 (xliv), the General Court was given power to impose a tax at different rates upon income derived from different classes of property but at a rate uniform throughout the commonwealth on incomes derived from the same class of property and to exempt the property producing such income from other taxes.\n Pursuant to this authority, a law was enacted in 1916 (General Acts 1916, c. 269), which it is sufficient to describe as taxing, with exceptions negligible here: Income received from bonds, notes, money at interest and debts due the person paying the tax; dividends on shares of any corporations not organized under the laws of Massachusetts; dividends on shares in partnerships, associations or trusts, the interest in which is represented by transferable shares; and income derived from professions, employments, trade or business. Intangible property, the income from which is taxed by the act, is practically exempted from local taxation.\n The validity of this act is not assailed.\n Prior to the enactment of this law, the taxing subdivisions of the state had taxed the real estate and tangible and intangible personal property, within their respective jurisdictions, for both state and local purposes, and the exemption from local taxation of intangible property, provided for in the act, necessarily resulted in an important reduction in their revenues.\n The proceeds of the income tax thus provided for were distributed by temporary acts applicable only to the years 1917 and 1918, but in the year 1919 the act was passed, the validity of which is assailed in this proceeding, which provides, in substance: That the state treasurer shall pay to each city, town and district, from the income tax \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 596]\n\u00a0\n collected for the year 1919, an amount equal to 90 per cent. of the difference between the average amount of the tax levied on tangible and intangible personal property therein in the years 1915 and 1916 and the average that would be produced by a tax upon the personal property actually assessed therein for the years 1917 and 1918 at the average of the rates of taxation prevailing therein in 1915 and 1916. In each succeeding year, until and including the year 1927, the amount payable was reduced to an amount 10 per cent. less than it was for the next preceding year. Any amount collected in any year prior to 1928, in excess of the required payments must be distributed to the cities, towns and districts of the state in proportion to the amount of the state tax imposed upon each for such year, and in 1928 and thereafter the whole of the amount of the income tax must be so distributed each year.\n It is obvious that it was the purpose of this act to reimburse the various taxing subdivisions until the year 1928 to the extent thought necessary to supply the loss which each would sustain by the withdrawal from its taxing power of the intangible property the income of which was taxed by the state, and that prior to 1928 any excess of the income tax fund over such requirements, and beginning with that year and continuing thereafter, the whole of that fund, should be distributed to such subdivisions in proportion to the amount of the state tax paid by each.\n The petition in the case is one for mandamus and the essential allegations of it are: That the petitioner, an inhabitant of the town of Brookline, in the years 1919 and 1920 derived income from intangible personal property and otherwise which rendered him subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Act of 1916; that the state tax in Massachusetts is imposed upon towns and cities in proportion to the value of the real estate and tangible personal property and polls taxable therein, without regard \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 597]\n\u00a0\n to intangible property or incomes taxed; that a sum in excess of $1,000, 000 was raised in the year 1920 by the taxation of the inhabitants of Brookline upon incomes derived during the year 1919 from intangible property located in that town and on other income earned therein, and that as great an amount will be in like manner raised in 1921; that under the distribution statute of 1919 there will be returned to the town of Brookline not more than $500,000 in the year 1920, and in each year thereafter a less amount, until in the year 1928 not more than $250,000 will be returned to it, while other towns, having greater real estate and tangible personal property valuation for taxation, will receive much more than their inhabitants will have contributed to the income tax fund; and that such payments may be used by the cities and towns receiving them, if they so elect, for the exclusive use and benefit of their own inhabitants for local and 'proprietary' purposes, which would not in any degree contribute to the benefit of the petitioner, or of the inhabitants of Brookline or of the citizens generally of the commonwealth. Upon these allegations a writ of mandamus, commanding the respondent not to distribute any of the income tax collected in the years 1920 or 1921, was prayed for.\n Upon demurrer the petition was dismissed.\n This statement of the case shows that it is admitted: That the Income Tax Act of 1916 is a valid law; that the contention is, only, that the act of 1919, providing for distribution of the tax, is unconstitutional; and that this contention rests wholly upon the allegation of the petition that such amount of the income tax collected by the state from the plaintiff in error and from other inhabitants of Brookline as may be returned to any other subdivision thereof, may, if the subdivision so elects, be used for local or 'proprietary' purposes such that no benefit whatever will accrue from the expenditure of the tax to the plaintiff \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 598]\n\u00a0\n in error or to other inhabitants of the town of Brookline or to the inhabitants of the state in general.\n It is argued that from these conditions it must follow that the plaintiff in error and other inhabitants of Brookline are taxed for the exclusive benefit of the inhabitants of other subdivisions of the state, and that this violates the due process of law clause, or, if not that, the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that therefore the proposed distribution of the tax should be restrained.\n The relation of the power of the federal courts to the taxing systems of the states has been the subject of much discussion in the opinions of this court, notably in the following cases: McCullough v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 428-432; Providence Bank v. Billings and Pittman, 4 Pet. 514, 563; State Tax on Foreign Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 319; Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 105; Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n, 497; Memphis Gas Light Co. v. Taxing District of Shelby County, \n109 \nU.S. 398, 400\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 205; Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 238 S., 10 Sup. Ct. 533; Merchants' & Manufacturers' Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 463\n, 464 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 829; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City, \n173 \nU.S. 592, 615\n, 616 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 553; Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, \n185 \nU.S. 364, 371\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 673; Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 220\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 66.\n While the nature of the subject does not permit of much finality of general statement, it may plainly be derived from the cases cited that since the system of taxation has not yet been devised which will return precisely the same measure of benefit to each taxpayer or class of taxpayers, in proportion to payment made, as will be returned to every other individual or class paying a given tax, it is not within either the disposition or power of this court to revise the necessarily complicated taxing systems of the states for the purpose of attempting to produce what might be thought to be a more just distribution of the \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 599]\n\u00a0\n burdens of taxation than that arrived at by the state Legislatures (4 Pet. 517; 15 Wall. 319; \n109 U.S. 400\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 205; \n185 U.S. 371\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 673, supra); and that where, as here, conflict with federal power is not involved, a state tax law will be held to conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment only where it proposes, or clearly results in, such flagrant and palpable inequality between the burden imposed and the benefit received, as to amount to the arbitrary taking of property without compensation-'to spoliation under the guise of exerting the power of taxing.' \n134 U.S. 237\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 533; \n173 U.S. 615\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 553; \n239 U.S. 220\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 66, supra. For other inequalities of burden or other abuses of the state power of taxation, the only security of the citizen must be found in the structure of our government itself. So early as 4 Pet. 563, supra, it was said by Chief Justice Marshall:\n'This vital power [of taxation] may be abused, but the Constitution of the United States was not intended to furnish the corrective for every abuse of power which may be committed by the state governments. The interest, wisdom, and justice of the representative body, and its relations with its constituents, furnish the only security, where there is no express contract, against unjust and excessive taxation; as well as against unwise legislation generally.'\n\n The application of this summary of the law renders our conclusion not doubtful.\n The income tax involved is uniform in its application to all income within the description of the act of all inhabitants of the state without regard to the taxing subdivision in which they may reside. It is collected by the state and the capital value producing the tax is practically exempted from other taxation. The tax was authorized by the people of the state and the act was given form by the Legislature, for the purpose of correcting flagrant inequalities of taxation, resulting from what the Supreme Judicial Court, in the opinion in this case, called the 'colonization' of wealthy owners of intangible securities in \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 600]\n\u00a0\n towns and cities which had exceptionally low rates of taxation 'brought about by avoidance and evasion, legal and illegal, of the tax laws prevailing before the enactment of the income tax law.' Report to the Senate and House of Representatives of Massachusetts by 'the Joint Special Committee on Taxation,' January 31, 1919. The report just referred to was made after an elaborate study of the subject of the distribution of this income tax, in the progress of which largely attended public hearings were held in many cities of the state, and it recommended the law assailed, in substantially the form in which it was enacted. The plan of returning the tax to the various taxing districts, in which those who paid it resided, which is so strongly urged in argument, was carefully considered and was rejected, as expensive and difficult, if not impracticable, of application, and as calculated to ignore the considerations which led to the enactment of the law and to restore the evils and inequalities of taxation which it was devised to correct. It is also apparent that this distribution law should not be considered as an isolated provision but as an important part, which it clearly is, of an elaborate and involved system of state taxation, which would be seriously affected by the granting of such a writ of mandamus as is prayed for.\n Accepting as true, as we must, the allegation of the petition, admitted by the demurrer, that the local subdivisions of the state may, 'if they so elect,' devote the money derived from the income tax through the distribution provided for in the act assailed, to purposes which might not confer any certain benefit upon the plaintiff in error or persons in like situations, yet, it must be accepted on the other hand that it is entirely clear that there are many purposes to which these subdivisions may devote the money, 'if they so elect,' which would be of such statewide influence that the plaintiff in error and those similarly situated would very certainly be benefited \n\n[256 U.S. 589, 601]\n\u00a0\n by the expenditure of it. It must be said also in this case, as was said by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in the decision of a similar case, Duffy v. Treasurer and Receiver General, 234 Mass. 42, 125 N. E. 135:\n'There is nothing on the record to justify the assumption that the several municipalities design to devote to other than public use any portion of the income tax thus distributed to them. Every presumption is in favor of legality in the absence of evidence to the contrary.'\n\n This presumption of legality is a sound and strong one, and is amply sufficient to prevail over the effect of the admitted allegation of the petition.\n The case presented is clearly not one of that extreme inequality in taxation of which the federal courts should lay hold, but involves rather a question of state policy, of a character which the people have been satisfied to leave to the judgment, patriotism and sense of justice of representatives in their state Legislature.\n The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAWSON v. KENTUCKY DISTILLERIES & WAREHOUSE CO(1921)\nNo. 439\nArgued: January 6, 1920Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 288, 289]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles I. Dawson, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellants.\n Mr. W. Overton Harris, of Louisville, Ky., for an appellant in No. 582.\n Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for appellee Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co.\n Messrs. T. Kennedy Helm, of Louisville, Ky., and Levi Cooke, of Washington, D. C., for appellee J. & A. Freiberg Co., Inc.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 12, 1920, the Legislature of Kentucky passed and the Governor approved an act (Acts 1920, c. 13) which imposed upon every person engaged in the business of manufacturing whisky or 'in the business of owning and storing' the same in bonded warehouses within the state what was called an 'annual license tax' of 50 cents a gallon upon all whisky either withdrawn from bond or transferred in bond from Kentucky to a point outside that state. \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n The act took effect, by its terms, on its approval by the Governor. At that time there were stored in such bonded warehouses about 30,000,000 gallons of whisky worth in bond perhaps $1.50 a gallon. Much of this whisky was owned by citizens of other states, their ownership being evidenced by negotiable warehouse receipts. Shortly after the enactment of the statute two suits were brought in the District Courts of the United States for Kentucky to enjoin its enforcement. The first was brought in the Western district, by the J. & A. Freiberg Company, Incorporated, an Ohio corporation; the second in the Eastern district by the Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Company, a New Jersey corporation. The Attorney General of the commonwealth and the auditor of public accounts were made defendants in each. In the former, the Louisville Public Warehouse Company was also a defendant; in the latter, the commonwealth's attorney.\n In the Freiberg case it was alleged that the whisky was in a general bonded warehouse,1 that the owner wished to withdraw it for removal in bond to a general bonded \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n warehouse in Massachusetts, and that the defendant warehouseman, acting under provisions of the Kentucky statute refused to permit such transfer unless the tax in question was paid by the owner. In the Distilleries Company case the plaintiff alleged that it had in its distillery warehouses large quantities of whisky, most of which was owned by others, that requests were being made daily either to withdraw lots from bond upon paying the government tax or to have them transferred in bond to other states, and that the defendants threatened to enforce heavy penalties if any such withdrawal or transfer was permitted without making payment of the 50 cents a gallon state tax. In each case a motion for an interlocutory injunction was made and heard before three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The substantial questions presented in the two suits were the same. The plaintiff contended, in each, that the Kentucky statute was void under both the state and federal Constitutions; and in each case the defendants, besides asserting the validity of the act, insisted, among other things, that the suit should be dismissed for want of equity because there was an adequate remedy at law. The District Courts granted plaintiffs the motions, holding that there was no adequate remedy at law and that the statute was invalid under the Constitution of the state because it was a property tax, was not uniform in its operation, and was confiscatory. The case comes here by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). We shall consider first the validity of the tax.\n First. The Attorney General concedes that the tax, if a property tax, is invalid; since it does not comply with the requirements of a property tax specified in section 171 of the state Constitution. It is not 'uniform upon all property of the same class subject to taxation,'2 and though \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 292]\n\u00a0\n called an 'annual' tax was not intended to be such. \n3\n He contends, however, that the tax is, as stated in the title of the act, a license tax upon 'the business of manufacturing' disilled spirits and upon 'the business of owning and storing such spirits in bonded warehouses.' Section 181 of the state Constitution authorizes license or occupation taxes, and statutes imposing such taxes measured by the amount of the product have been repeatedly sustained by its highest court. Raydure v. Board of Supervisors of Estill County, 183 Ky. 84, 209 S. W. 19; Strater Bros. Tobacco Co. v. Commonwealth, 117 Ky. 604, 78 S. W. 871. Here we are concerned only with the taxes which are alleged to be on 'the business of owning and storing such spirits in bonded warehouses.' The question is whether as to such this 50 cents a gallon tax is an occupation tax or is a property tax. The question is one of local law, so that a decision of it by the highest court of the state would be accepted by us as conclusive. But the validity of the statute does not appear to have been passed upon by any Kentucky court. We are, therefore, called upon, as were the District Courts, to determine this question of state law.\n The name by which the tax is described in the statute is, of course, immaterial. Its character must be determined by its incidents; and obviously it has none of the \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 293]\n\u00a0\n ordinary incidents of an occupation tax. Unlike the tax of 1 1\/4 cents a gallon upon rectifiers sustained in Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 U.S. 563\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 578, and the tax of 2 cents a gallon upon distillers and warehousemen sustained in Green, Auditor, v. Taylor, Jr., & Sons, 184 Ky. 739, 212 S. W. 925, this tax is not upon the business or occupation of the warehouseman. A particular lot of whisky may pass through a dozen bonded warehouses without one of them being obliged to pay the tax. For the only warehouseman required to do so, is he who has the whisky on storage at the time of its removal from bond (government) tax paid or when it is transferred in bond to another state. The tax is made primarily payable by the warehouseman and to secure its payment the state is given a lien upon the warehouse and the whisky therein. But the warehouseman is a collection agency merely empowered to get reimbursement through subrogation to the state's lien on the whisky of others which ultimately bears the burden of the tax. Nor is the alleged business of merely owning and storing whisky in bond made taxable. So long as the whisky is stored in bond within the state it is free of the tax. One may own and store the whisky for years in the hope of selling it at a profit, and yet be free from any obligation ever to pay this tax, if, before its removal from bond within the state, the whisky is sold to another, or if, while so owned, it is destroyed or forfeited to the government. Likewise the tax is not one imposed upon the business of owning, storing and removing whisky from bond. For the tax would become payable on account of whisky removed, although there had not been storage for any appreciable time; thus the tax would be payable on whisky if it had been removed from the warehouse immediately after the approval of the act. Nor is the tax one on the business of removing liquor owned. For the tax is payable in respect to any lot of whisky removed; and a single transaction does not constitute \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 294]\n\u00a0\n engaging in the business, be it that of buying and selling whisky or in the business of otherwise using it. \n4\n In fact the tax is one imposed upon each lot of whisky at the time it is removed from bond within the state. The tax might be said to be upon the act of removal from the bonded warehouse within the state. But, as stated by the lower court, 'the thing really taxed is the act of the owner in taking his property out of storage into his own possession (absolute or qualified) for the purpose of making some one of the only uses of which it is capable; i. e., consumption, sale or keeping for future consumption or sale. ... The whole value of the whisky depends upon the owner's right to get it from the place where the law has compelled him to put it, and to tax the right is to tax the value.' To levy a tax by reason of ownership of property is to tax the property. Compare Thompson, Auditor, v. Kreutzer, 112 Miss. 165, 72 South. 891; Thompson, Auditor, v. McLeod, 112 Miss. 383, 73 South, 193, L. R. A. 1918C, 893, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 674. It cannot be made an occupation or license tax by calling it so. See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 148-150, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, \n220 U.S. 187\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 361; United States v. Emery, \n237 U.S. 28\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 499. The language of the emergency clause in the act discloses that the legislature considered that it was, in fact, taxing the whisky. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n As we hold the tax to be one on property, and it is conceded that, if it be such, it is invalid under the state Constitution, we have no occasion to consider whether \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 295]\n\u00a0\n it would be also invalid under the state Constitution as a license or excise tax, because confiscatory (compare Owen County v. F. & A. Cox Co., 132 Ky. 738, 743, 117 S. W. 296, 21 L. R. A. [N. S.] 83; City of Louisville v. Pooley, 136 Ky. 286, 124 S. W. 315, 26 L. R. A. [N. S.] 582; Sallsbury v. Equitable Purchasing Co., 177 Ky. 348, 351, 354, 197 S. W. 813, L. R. A. 1918A, 1114), or for other reasons. Nor need we consider whether it is not also obnoxious to the federal Constitution as imposing a burden upon interstate commerce. Compare Heyman v. Hays, \n236 U.S. 178\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 403.\n Second. The Attorney General insists that these bills in equity should have been dismissed because each plaintiff had a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law. The contention rests upon section 162 of the Kentucky Statutes, which declares that:\n'When it shall appear to the auditor that money has been paid into the treasury for taxes when no such taxes were in fact due, he shall issue his warrant on the treasury for such money so improperly paid, in behalf of the person who paid the same.'\n\n Greene, Auditor, v. Taylor, Jr., & Sons, 184 Ky. 739, 212 S. W. 925, is cited to show that, if the auditor fails in this duty, a writ of mandamus will issue to compel performance. The plaintiffs, it is said, should have paid the tax under protest and have sued at law to recover the amounts so paid. But when these suits were brought (April and May, 1920) the decisions of the highest court of the state left it at least doubtful whether money so paid could have been recoverd at law by the taxpayer, among other reasons, because the money would not have been paid under compulsion of distraint or of a right of distraint or under a mistake of law or of fact. \n6\n It was not until November 16, 1920, which was after these appeals had been entered in \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 296]\n\u00a0\n this court, that Craig v. Security Producing & Refining Co., 189 Ky. 565, 568, 225 S. W. 729, settled that money paid under such circumstances could be recovered. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky recognized the doubt arising from its earlier decisions and in order to remove the doubt found it necessary to overrule several of its recent opinions 'so far as they conflict with the construction herein given section 162.'\n It is well settled that 'if the remedy at law be doubtful, a court of equity will not decline cognizance of the suit.' Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 555, 558 (39 L. Ed. 578). But, whatever remedies section 162 is now regarded as conferring, it is clear that at the time this suit was brought they were not regarded in Kentucky as sufficiently adequate to oust the jurisdiction of equity to enjoin the illegal collection of taxes. Gates v. Barrett, 79 Ky. 295; Norman v. Boaz, 85 Ky. 557, 560, 4 S. W. 316; Negley v. Henderson Bridge Co., 107 Ky. 414, 54 S. W. 171; Louisville Trust Co. v. Stone, 107 Fed. 305, 309, 46 C. C. A. 299. And if the equitable remedy was available in the state courts it was not lost by suing in the federal court. Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 221; Cowley v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n159 U.S. 569\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 127. Nor is the equitable jurisdiction lost because since the filing of the bill an adequate legal remedy may have become available. Beedle v. Bennett, \n122 U.S. 71\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1090; Busch v. Jones, \n184 U.S. 598\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 511. We have no occasion, therefore, to consider other reasons urged why the legal remedy, if any, would have been inadequate.\n Third. The Attorney General moved that these suits be abated, relying upon the amendment to section 266 of the Judicial Code by Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013 (Comp. St.  1243), which declares that if before the final hearing of an application to restrain the enforcement of a statute or an order made by an administrative board or commission--\n'a suit shall have been brought in a court of the state having jurisdiction thereof under the laws of such state, \n\n[255 U.S. 288, 297]\n\u00a0\n to enforce such statute or order, accompanied by a stay in such state court of proceedings under such statute or order pending the determination of such suit by such state court, all proceedings in any court of the United States to restrain the execution of such statute or order shall be stayed pending the final determination of such suit in the courts of the state.'\n\n The suit pending in the state court was this: A liquor dealer who owned whisky in a distillery warehouse had, prior to the enactment of the statute here in question, caused it to be bottled in bond and had paid thereon the 2-cent a gallon state tax imposed under the law of 1917. Acts Sp. Sess. Ky. 1917, c. 5,  1. He claimed the right to withdraw the whisky from bond without payment of the 50-cent a gallon tax; and brought suit in a county court to enjoin the warehouseman from preventing his doing so. The latter set up this 1920 act. Thereupon the plaintiff by amended petition joined the Attorney General and the auditor as codefendants and prayed that they be enjoined from compelling the plaintiff or the warehouseman to pay the 50-cent a gallon tax on the plaintiff's whisky. A restraining order to that effect issued.\n Whether this suit in the county court was of such a character as to entitle the state officials to stay the proceedings in the federal court we do not decide. Strictly speaking it was not 'brought ... to enforce' the statute in question; but it is, at least, arguable that it might have been accepted by the state officials as a means to that end, and so have fulfilled in substance the statutory requirement. See House Report No. 1584, 62d Cong. 3d Sess. But whether this is true or not, it was not 'accompanied by a stay in such state court of proceedings under such statute' within the meaning of the Judicial Code.

CITY OF DETROIT(1921)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York, City, and Elliott G. Stevenson, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clarence E. Wilcox and Alfred Lucking, both of Detroit, Mich., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, plaintiff below, sets forth in its bill that it is the owner of a system of street railways in the city of Detroit, and suburban lines running from said city. The suit was brought in the District Court, to enjoin the city of Detroit and the other defendants, municipal officials, from acquiring or constructing a system of street railways, which had been provided for by an ordinance of the city, with an issue of $ 15,000,000 of its bonds for that purpose and approved by the requisite majority at a municipal election. The grounds of relief, briefly stated, are: That establishment of the system and the issue of the bonds should be enjoined at the instance of the plaintiff because the ordinance was not legally adopted by the voters of the city of Detroit and, if carried into effect, as proposed, and by the methods which brought about its adoption, a deprivation of plaintiff's property rights without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States would result.\n The District Court maintained the jurisdiction upon the federal ground alleged, and dismissed the bill upon motion in the nature of a demurrer. The case is brought to this court by direct appeal because of the constitutional question involved.\n The bill is very voluminous and abounds in argumentative statements attacking the passage of the ordinance, and the good faith of the officials concerned in bringing about its enactment. Among the streets, proposed to be occupied by the city, are those upon which it is alleged the trackage and property rights of the complainants are \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n sought to be acquired, and upon which the franchise grants of the street railway company have expired.\n This court in Detroit United Railways v. City of Detroit, \n229 U.S. 39\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 697, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan in the same case, Detroit v. Detroit United Ry., 172 Mich. 136, 137 N. W. 645, held that where a street railway company, operating in the streets of the city under a franchise granted for a definite period, has enjoyed the full term of the grant, the municipality may, upon failure of renewal of the grant, require the company within a reasonable time to remove its tracks and other property from the streets, without impairing any contractual obligations protected by the federal Constitution or depriving the street railway company of its property without due process of law. We see no occasion to depart from the principles announced in that case. The decree is in the record and, so far as anything appears, is still in full force and effect. If the courts of Michigan shall see fit to carry it into execution we find nothing in the federal Constitution which would make its enforcement a deprivation of due process of law.\n The railway company claims to have acquired property rights in the streets of the city, upon which its franchises have expired, by reason of matters set out in the bill and supported in the argument submitted by the appellant. Reference is made to certain so-called day to day arrangements, by which continued operation was permitted notwithstanding the expiration of franchise rights. But an examination shows that construction and operation under such agreements gave the railway company no extended franchises in the streets, because it was expressly provided that the permits granted might be revoked, and that action under the day to day agreement should not waive the rights of either party.\n Rights to remain in the streets are also claimed under the so-called Kronk Ordinance, which was before this court in Detroit United Railways v. Detroit, \n248 U.S. 429\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 151, \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 175]\n\u00a0\n in which this court, while reaffirming the principles laid down in Detroit United Railway Co. v. Detroit, \n229 U.S. 39\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 697, supra, found that the city had not up to that time availed itself of the right to compel the removal of the tracks in streets where the company had no franchise, but had passed an ordinance looking to the continued operation by the company of the street railway system for a limited period, and that while it acted under this ordinance there was the equivalent of a grant to operate during the life of the ordinance, entitling the company to a fair return; that the ordinance by its express terms provided for its amendment or repeal, and that, unless amended or repealed, it should remain in force for the period of one year. We do not perceive how that ordinance can now give rights to the company in the streets where the franchises have expired.\n The chancery suit brought in the Wayne county circuit court in the name of the city of Detroit, in which a decree was granted, is also set up. An examination of that decree, which is attached to the bill, satisfies us that it was intended only to provide a temporary arrangement by which cars might be operated on the street railway system of the complainant. It is expressly stated in the decree that it shall not affect any fundamental rights of the parties in and to the streets of the city of Detroit as they at that time existed; the intention being to provide for the rate of fare at which cars should be operated; the decree being considered only a temporary solution of the problem before the court.\n Allegations are made which are supposed to have the effect of estopping the city of Detroit from denying the franchise rights of the plaintiff in the streets of the city because of expenditures of large sums of money with the knowledge and acquiescence of the city authorities and the people of the city since the franchises have expired.\n Under the Constitution of Michigan, art. 8,  25 (as \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 176]\n\u00a0\n revised 1908), it is provided that no city or village shall grant any public utility franchise, which is not subject to revocation at the will of the city or village, unless such proposition shall first have the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the electors. This phase of the case is covered in principle by our decision in Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 U.S. 129\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 665, in which a similar provision of the Colorado Constitution was under consideration, and wherein this court, in speaking of the provision of the Constitution of the state of Colorado, said:\n'Besides, article 20,  4, of the state Constitution then in force provided that no franchise relating to the streets of the city should be granted except upon a vote of the electors, and article 9 of the city charter then in force made a like vote a prerequisite to the acquisition by the city of any public utility. So, had the council attempted by the ordinance of 1907 to made an election to purchase or renew, the attempt would have gone for nothing.'\n\n The provision of the Constitution of Michigan, in force when the ordinance here in controversy was passed, necessarily prevents acquiring rights by estoppel which might arise were the franchise within the power of the city to grant. In Denver Water Co. v. Denver, \n246 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 278, the provision of the Colorado Constitution was not considered. Nor in Detroit United Ry. v. Detroit, \n248 U.S. 429\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 151, was reference made to the like provision of the Michigan Constitution now relied upon.\n The charge is made at length in the bill that the city officials, by means of the proceedings complained of, are engaged in a scheme designed to compel the company to part with its property at a sum much less than its fair value, or to cease to operate in the streets and to remove its property therefrom. In this connection it is charged that the real purpose is to compel the sale of the property of the street railway company at $40, 000 per mile of track, which is far less than its actual value. The giving \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 177]\n\u00a0\n effect to this scheme, it is averred, would work a deprivation of constitutional rights of the complainant in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, if the city has the right to acquire the property on the best terms it can make with the company in view of the expiration of the franchises, an attempt to carry out such purpose by an offer to buy the property at much less than its value would not have the effect to deprive the company of property without due process of law. It was so ruled in Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 U.S. 123\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 657, supra. In that case this court, in speaking of an alleged attempt of the city to acquire the company's plant after the expiration of its franchise for much less than its fair value, among other things, said:\n'Whether $7,000,000 is an adequate price for the company's plant, and whether its value will be ruinously impaired by the construction of a municipal plant, are beside the question. Being under no obligation to purchase, the city is free to name its own terms, and the water company is likewise free to accept or reject them. The latter is under no compulsion other than such as inheres in the nature of its property or arises from a proper regard of its own interests. That the city, mindful of its interests, offered $7,000,000 for the water company's plant, when it could have proceeded to the construction of a new plant of its own, without making any offer to the company, affords no ground for complaint by the latter.'\n\n Furthermore, it appears that under the charter of the city of Detroit, notwithstanding the alleged attempt to procure the property of the complainant at much less than its value, no such purpose could be effected by purchase without approval of the electors of the city. Section 8 of the charter provides:\n'Any contract to purchase or lease herein contemplated, or any plan to condemn existing street railway property shall be void unless approved by three-fifths of the electors \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 178]\n\u00a0\n voting thereon at any regular or special election, and upon such proposition women tax payers having the qualifications of male electors shall be entitled to vote.'\n\n No such contract has thus far been made and there is nothing in the ordinance attacked which undertakes to acquire the property of the complainant without compliance with this charter provision.\n The bill abounds in allegations that voters were misled by the fraudulent conduct of the officials of the city in their efforts to procure the property of the complainant at less than its value by misrepresenting in a circular, and otherwise, the purpose and effect of the vote to be taken upon the question of acquiring a municipal system of transportation. We think that the court below correctly held that the motives of the officials, and of the electors acting upon the proposal, are not proper subjects of judicial inquiry in an action like this so long as the means adopted for submission of the question to the people conformed to the requirements of the law. The principle has been declared by this court. Angle v. Ry. Co., \n151 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 240; Soon Hing v. Crowley, \n113 \nU.S. 703, 710\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 730. This feature of the bill is an attempt to inquire in a collateral way into the validity of an election which was held without steps being taken to enjoin, and which was vigorously contested to a final result.\n The charter of the city of Detroit gave ample power to the city to acquire, construct, own, maintain and operate a street railway system on the streets of the city within a distance of ten miles from any portion of its corporate limits that the public convenience may require. Section 1, c. 13, Charter of Detroit, 1918. Section 6 of the charter makes it the duty of the board of street railway commissioners to promptly proceed to purchase, acquire and construct, and to own and operate a system of street railways in or for the city, and as soon as practicable \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 179]\n\u00a0\n to make the system exclusive. Section 7 gives the board power to purchase, or lease, or by appropriate proceedings to acquire, any part of the existing street railway property in the city, and to make the necessary purchases for that purpose. Section 9 gives authority to issue bonds of the city.\n Under the authority of the charter the ordinance in question was passed. It directs the board of street railway commissioners to acquire, own, maintain and operate a street railway system. It requires that the proposition to acquire, own, maintain the system and to issue bonds shall be submitted to a vote at a special election. It is contended, however, that the proposal submitted did not conform to the requirements of the ordinance.\n We agree with the District Court that the form of submission of the question was in substantial compliance with the law.\n As to allegations of fraudulent and improper conduct of the common council in giving the electors information in advance of the election which misled them, the contention is that a sample ballot sent out to the electors did not definitely show the purpose to construct street railway lines where trackage already existed, and that the voters of the city were misled into believing that there was an intention not to construct the street railway lines where the same already existed, but to purchase at an estimated cost of $40,000 per mile. But we are of opinion that this so- called official information, no complaint being made of it before the election, cannot vitiate the election when the same was had upon a submission, within the authority of the city under its charter, and the ordinance passed in the form shown. Moreover, as we have already pointed out, this ordinance does not provide for acquisition at $40,000 per mile; nor can any purchase be made except by contract approved by the electors \n\n[255 U.S. 171, 180]\n\u00a0\n as provided by section 8 of the charter. Other considerations are urged based upon lack of authority in the city which we have examined and deem it unnecessary to discuss.\n We find nothing in the allegations of this bill establishing that the city of Detroit in proceeding by its officials in the manner alleged, has done things which are subversive of the rights of the city to establish its own municipal system of street railways and to issue bonds for that purpose or which would amount to deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiff by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n It follows that the decree of the District Court dismissing the bill must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDILLON v. GLOSS(1921)\nNo. 251\nArgued: March 22, 1921Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 368, 369]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Levi Cooke, of Washington, D. C., and Theodore A. Bell, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 368, 370]\n\u00a0\n The Assistant Attorney General Adams, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte Dillon (D. C.) 262 Fed. 563. The petitioner was in custody under section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, on a charge of transporting intoxicating liquor in violation of section 3 of that title, and by his petition sought to be discharged on several grounds, all but two of which were abandoned after the decision in National Prohibition Cases, \n253 U.S. 350\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 486, 588. The remaining grounds are, first, that the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, to enforce which title 2 of the act was adopted, is invalid, because the congressional \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n resolution (40 Stat. 1050) proposing the amendment declared that it should be inoperative unless ratified within seven years; and, secondly, that, in any event, the provisions of the act which the petitioner was charged with violating, and under which he was arrested, had not gone into effect at the time of the asserted violation nor at the time of the arrest.\n The power to amend the Constitution and the mode of exerting it are dealt with in article 5, which reads:\n'The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress: Provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.'\n\n It will be seen that this article says nothing about the time within which ratification may be had-neither that it shall be unlimited nor that it shall be fixed by Congress. What then is the reasonable inference or implication? Is it that ratification may be had at any time, as within a few years, a century or even a longer period, or that it must be had within some reasonable period which Congress is left free to define? Neither the debates in the federal convention which framed the Constitution nor those in the state conventions which ratified it shed any light on the question.\n The proposal for the Eighteenth Amendment is the \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n first in which a definite period for ratification was fixed. \n1\n Theretofore 21 amendments had been proposed by Congress and seventeen of these had been ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the states-some within a single year after their proposal and all within four years. Each of the remaining 4 had been ratified in some of the states, but not in a sufficient number. \n2\n Eighty years after the partial ratification of one, an effort was made to complete its ratification, and the Legislature of Ohio passed a joint resolution to that end,3 after which the effort was abandoned. Two, after ratification in one less than the required number of states had lain dormant for a century. \n4\n The other, proposed March 2, 1861, declared:\n'No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any state, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said state.'5\n\n Its principal purpose was to protect slavery and at the time of its proposal and partial ratification it was a subject of absorbing interest, but after the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment it was generally forgotten. Whether an amendment \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 373]\n\u00a0\n proposed without fixing any time for ratification, and which after favorable action in less than the required number of states had lain dormant for many years, could be resurrected and its ratification completed had been mooted on several occasions, but was still an open question.\n These were the circumstances in the light of which Congress in proposing the Eighteenth Amendment fixed seven years as the period for ratification. Whether this could be done was questioned at the time and debated at length, but the prevailing view in both houses was that some limitation was intended and that seven years was a reasonable period. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n That the Constitution contains no express provision on the subject is not in itself controlling; for with the Constitution, as with a statute or other written instrument, what is reasonably implied is as much a part of it as what is expressed. \n7\n An examination of article 5 discloses that it is intended to invest Congress with a wide range of power in proposing amendments. Passing a provision long since expired,8 it subjects this power to only two restrictions: one that the proposal shall have the approval of two-thirds of both houses, and the other excluding any amendment which will deprive any state, without \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 374]\n\u00a0\n its consent, of its equal suffrage in the Senate. \n9\n A further mode of proposal-as yet never invoked-is provided, which is, that on the application of two-thirds of the states Congress shall call a convention for the purpose. When proposed in either mode amendments to be effective must be ratified by the Legislatures, or by conventions, in three-fourths of the states, 'as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress.' Thus the people of the United States, by whom the Constitution was ordained and established, have made it a condition to amending that instrument that the amendment be submitted to representative assemblies in the several states and be ratified in three-fourths of them. The plain meaning of this is (a) that all amendments must have the sanction of the people of the United States, the original fountain of power, acting through representative assemblies, and (b) that ratification by these assemblies in three-fourths of the states shall be taken as a decisive expression of the people's will and be binding on all. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n We do not find anything in the article which suggests that an amendment once proposed is to be open to ratification for all time, or that ratification in some of the states may be separated from that in others by many years and yet be effective. We do find that which strongly suggests the contrary. First, proposal and ratification are not treated as unrelated acts, but as succeeding steps \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 375]\n\u00a0\n in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that they are not to be widely separated in time. Secondly, it is only when there is deemed to be a necessity therefor that amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable implication being that when proposed they are to be considered and disposed of presently. Thirdly, as ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people and is to be effective when had in three- fourths of the states, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently contemporaneous in that number of states to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of course ratification scattered through a long series of years would not do. These considerations and the general purport and spirit of the article lead to the conclusion expressed by Judge Jameson11 'that an alteration of the Constitution proposed to-day has relation to the sentiment and the felt needs of to-day, and that, if not ratified early while that sentiment may fairly be supposed to exist, it ought to be regarded as waived, and not again to be voted upon, unless a second time proposed by Congress.' That this is the better conclusion becomes even more manifest when what is comprehended in the other view is considered; for, according to it, four amendments proposed long ago-two in 1789, one in 1810 and one in 1861-are still pending and in a situation where their ratification in some of the states many years since by representatives of generations now largely forgotten may be effectively supplemented in enough more states to make three-fourths by representatives of the present or some future generation. To that view few would be able to subscribe, and in our opinion it is quite untenable. We conclude that the fair inference or implication from article 5 is that the ratification must be within some reasonable time after the proposal.\n Of the power of Congress, keeping within reasonable \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 376]\n\u00a0\n limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification we entertain no doubt. As a rule the Constitution speaks in general terms, leaving Congress to deal with subsidiary matters of detail as the public interests and changing conditions may require;12 and article 5 is no exception to the rule. Whether a definite period for ratification shall be fixed, so that all may know what it is and speculation on what is a reasonable time may be avoided, is, in our opinion, a matter of detail which Congress may determine as an incident of its power to designate the mode of ratification. It is not questioned that seven years, the period fixed in this instance, was reasonable, if power existed to fix a definite time; nor could it well be questioned considering the periods within which prior amendments were ratified.\n The provisions of the act which the petitioner was charged with violating and under which he was arrested (title 2,  3, 26) were by the terms of the act (title 3,  21) to be in force from and after the date when the Eighteenth Amendment should go into effect, and the latter by its own terms was to go into effect one year after being ratified. Its ratification, of which we take judicial notice, was consummated January 16, 1919.13 That the Secretary of State did not proclaim its ratification until January 29, 1919,14 is not material, for the date of its consummation, and not that on which it is proclaimed, controls. It follows that the provisions of the act with which the petitioner is concerned went into effect January \n\n[256 U.S. 368, 377]\n\u00a0\n 16, 1920. His alleged offense and his arrest were on the following day; so his claim that those provisions had not gone into effect at the time is not well grounded.\n Final order affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some consideration had been given to the subject before, but without any definite action.

VISCOSE CO.(1921)\nNo. 424\nArgued: December 8, 1920Decided: January 3, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry Wolf Bikle, Theodore W. Reath, and F. M. Rivinus, all of Philadelphia, Pa., and Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for carriers.\n Mr. Harold S. Shertz, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Viscose Co.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Silk, artificial and natural, had been accepted by the railway carriers of the country for transportation as \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n freight for many years prior to the action which gave rise to the question which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has certified herein to this Court and it had been classified in tariffs as first class. On January 21, 1920, Walker D. Hines, as Director General of Railroads, authorized an amendment or supplement to the appropriate freight tariff schedule so as to cancel the published classification and rates on such silk and to so amend rule 3 of 'Consolidated Freight Classification No. 1' as to include it among the articles 'that will not be accepted for shipment.'\n On the 28th of January, 1920, the supplement thus authorized was filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, to become effective on the 29th day of February following, and if no other action had been taken the result would have been to have excluded such silks for shipment as freight after the effective date, for after that date there would not have been any published rate applicable to them.\n The appellee, the Viscose Company, is an extensive manufacturer of artificial silk, 8o per cent. of which 'it maintains' must be shipped as freight, and, claiming that it would suffer great and irreparable damage if the supplement to the tariff proposed by the appellants were allowed to become effective, on February 26th, three days before it would have taken effect, the company applied for and obtained a temporary, and later on a permanent, injunction from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, restraining the Director General of Railroads and the other appellants:\n'(1) From putting into effect and enforcing the provisions of the said supplement No. 2 to 'Consolidated Freight Classification No. 1, designed to cancel the existing classification of artificial silk as a commodity of freight,' and \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n '(2) From refusing to accept from the Viscose Company artificial or fibre silk for transportation under classifications which existed prior to the effective date of said supplement, or under such other classification as may be put into effect thereafter.'\n\n An appeal from the District Court carried the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certifies to this court the question:\n'Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the matter raised by the complainant's bill and thereupon to annul the said action of the Director General of Railroads and enjoin the carriers from complying therewith?'\n\n Appellants contend that exclusive initial jurisdiction over the controversy here involved is in the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the appellees should have applied to that tribunal for relief. It is argued that the proposed supplement, striking silks from the first class in the tariffs filed was a change in classification and that the change in rule 3, adding them to the list of commodities which would not be accepted for shipment as freight, was a change of regulation and that over the reasonableness of both of these the Interstate Commerce Commission is given exclusive initial jurisdiction by sections 1, 3, 6, 13 and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (34 Stat. 584, as amended 36 Stat. 539 [Comp. St .  8563, subd. 4, 8565, 8569, 8581, 8583, subd. 2]).\n On the other hand, it is argued by the appellees that for a common carrier to exclude a commodity from the tariffs and to refuse to accept it for shipment is neither classification nor regulation, and that an attempt to do such a thing presents a question of law for the courts-that exclusion is not classification nor regulation.\n Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act makes it the duty of all carriers subject to its provisions to provide and furnish transportation upon reasonable request therefor, '... to establish, observe and enforce just and reasonable classifications of property for trans portation \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n ... and just and reasonable regulations and practices affecting classification, rates or tariffs ... and all other matters relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, transporting, storing and delivery of property.' 36 Stat. 539, 545, 546 (Comp. St.  8563, subd. 4).\n Section 3 of the act makes it unlawful for any carrier to subject 'any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.' 24 Stat. 379, 380 ( section 8565).\n Section 6 requires every carrier to print and file with the commission schedules in form prescribed, showing the classification of freight in force and any rules or regulations which in any wise change, affect or determine the value of the service rendered to the shipper. 34 Stat. 584, 586 (section 8569).\n Section 13 gives to any person or corporation the right to apply to the commission for relief on account of 'anything done or omitted to be done' by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act 'in contravention of the provisions thereof.' 36 Stat. 539, 550 (section 8581).\n And section 15 declares that whenever there is filed 'a new individual or joint classification or any new individual or joint regulation or practice' the commission shall have power to suspend the operation of such schedule, classification, regulation or practice until, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, an investigation shall be made, and if the proposed classification or regulation is found to be unreasonable or otherwise in violation of the act, the commission may find what will be just and reasonable in the premises and may require the carrier thereafter to conform to its finding. 36 Stat. 539, 552 (section 8583, subd. 2).\n The power to suspend classifications or regulations when issued by the President was taken away from the Interstate Commerce Commission by the 'Act to Provide for the Operation of Transportation Systems While under Federal Control,' etc. (40 Stat. 451, 456 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p]), but the \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n power over them after hearing remained, and the power to suspend was restored when 'the Transportation Act 1920,' approved February 28, 1920, became effective (41 Stat. 456, 487). The action of the Director General of Railroads, under consideration in this case, may therefore be treated as if it had been taken by a carrier subject to the act.\n Without more, these references to the Interstate Commerce Act are sufficient to show that if the proposed change in the tariffs, and in the rule, which we are considering, constituted a change of classification or of regulation within the meaning of the Commerce Act, there was ample and specific provision made therein for dealing with the situation through the commission-for suspending the supplement or rule or annulling either or both if investigation proved the change to be unreasonable, and for providing for just treatment of shippers in the future. Strangely enough, it is a shipper not a carrier which here seeks to exclude the latter mission.\n The certificate does not state what the purpose of the Director General of Railroads was in attempting to make the proposed change, but whether it was to permanently reguse to carry artificial silk as freight because of its value or of the risk involved, or for any other reason, or whether the action was taken to clear the way for putting into effect a commodity rate higher than the first-class rate (as might be done under appropriate conditions, Chamber of Commerce, Houston, Texas, v. I. & G. N. Railway Co., 32 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 247, 255; Wheeling Corrugating Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 18 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 125, 126), in either case it was necessary that the published classification of rates should be withdrawn by change of the tariffs on file and that notice should be given, through rule or regulation, that the silk would not be accepted for shipment in the future. Thus the supplement \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n involved a change in the contents of previously filed classification lists and in a rule or regulation of the carriers.\n That 'exclusion is not classification' is an arresting but illusory expression. Classification in carrier rate-making practice is grouping-the associating in a designated list, commodities, which, because of their inherent quality or value, or of the risks involved in shipment, or because of the manner or volume in which they are shipped or loaded, and the like, may justly and conveniently be given similar rates. To exclude a commodity from all classes is classification of it in as real a sense and with as definite an effect as to include it in any one of the usual classes. To strike artificial silk from the first class and to include it in the 'prohibited list' which, for any cause, the carrier refuses to accept as freight, classifies it and sets it apart in a group subject to special treatment, as much as if it had been changed to the second class. We cannot doubt that the 'exclusion' in this case was an attempted 'classification,' and that the proposed change in rule 3 was an attempted change of regulation, applicable to artificial silks, and that when challenged by the shipper the reasonableness of both presented a question for decision within the exclusive initial jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Confirmation of this conclusion may be found in Lake and Rail Butter and Egg Rates, 29 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 45. There carriers on the Great Lakes issued a supplement to their tariffs (as was done here) adding to the list of commodities which would not be accepted for shipment among other articles, butter, poultry and eggs. This was defended on the ground that such traffic required refrigeration at a cost greater than it would bear. Upon complaint by shippers to the Interstate Commerce Commission that the proposed action was unreasonable, the supplement was promptly suspended and upon full hearing it was held \n\n[254 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n that the refusal to carry such commodities in the past and the attempt to fortify such refusal for the future by filing tariffs declining in terms to receive them, were unduly prejudicial to the traffic involved, and, the request of shippers for such transportation being held reasonable, an order that it be furnished was authorized.\n The contention of the carriers, faintly made, that the common law and not the Interstate Commerce Act furnished the measure of their obligation to the public was promptly overruled by the commission, informed, as it was, by wide experience in traffic affairs and in the administration of the act.\n The importance to the commerce of the country of the exclusive, initial jurisdiction which Congress has committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission need not be repeated and cannot be overstated (Texas & Pacific R. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 U.S. 426\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. United States, \n215 U.S. 481\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 164; Morrisdale Coal Co. v.

R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 43, 49\n, 36 S. Sup.

R P ANDREWS PAPER CO(1921)\nNo. 282\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. H. Stephens, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. M. D. Rosenberg and Charles L. Frailey, both of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n MR. JUSTICE CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases, tried on agreed statements of fact, were argued and will be disposed of together.\n The respondents were assessed a rental upon vaults under sidewalks which were used in connection with business conducted in adjacent buildings. They refused to pay the assessments, and in these suits to collect them, judgments were rendered by the Supreme Court in favor of the District, which were reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the act of Congress authorizing the assessments was applicable only to constructions permitted after its date. \n\n[256 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n The essential facts are as follows:\n The appropriation act for the District of Columbia, approved September 1, 1916 (39 Stat. 676, 716,  7), provided:\n'That hereafter the commissioners of the District of Columbia are authorized and directed to assess and collect rent from all users of space occupied under the sidewalks and streets in the District of Columbia, which said space is occupied or used in connection with the business of said users.'\n\n Pursuant to this authority, the commissioners caused the space occupied by vaults of each of the three respondents to be valued and then assessed against each of them a rental which it is stipulated is 'fair and reasonable' in amount, 'if it be a legal charge.'\n The permits involved in the Paper Company and Lisner Cases were issued before the act complained of was passed, and these two cases will be first considered.\n The essential provisions of each of these permits are:\n'This is to certify that ... has permission to build vault ... as per plan ... in accordance with application ... on file in this office, and subject to the provisions of the Building Regulations of the District of Columbia.'\n\n There is nothing in either permit in the nature of a grant or which enlarges the permission beyond the terms quoted.\n When these permits were issued, the Building Regulations provided ( paragraph 9):\n'No charge will be made for the occupancy of public space by vault or areas except the usual permit fee, but all permits for such occupancy are subject to revocation by the commissioners at any time without compensation when the vault space is needed for public use or improvement. ... And this permit is accepted with the understanding that the occupation of the vault space is permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of \n\n[256 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n the abutting premises and that no right, title or interest of the public is in any way waived or abridged thereby, except as expressed in said permit and the conditions aforesaid.'\n\n Then follows an agreement by the licensee to use the vault only for the purposes authorized by the commissioners.\n And paragraph 3 provided:\n'The application for a vault must be accompanied by the written agreement, upon an official blank, signed by the owner of the abutting property ... contracting to release and relinquish the vault space and to remove, free of expense to the District, all machinery, fixtures, or structural parts of the vault when so ordered by the commissioners, or needed for public use.'\n\n The only charge made by the District was $1 for the permit to construct.\n Pursuant to paragraph 3, supra, the applicants each signed an agreement in precisely the same from, accepting the permit on condition (1) that the District shall have the right to construct under, over or through the vault public sewers or other underground construction which it may deem necessary, without compensation; and (2) that upon notice from the District of a desire to place any such construction in the area occupied by the vault, space clear and sufficient for it shall forthwith be made therein (by the acceptor) 'without cost to the District.' The acceptance concludes:\n'This permit is accepted with the understanding that the occupation of the vault space is permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of the abutting premises, and that no right, title or interest in the public is in any way abridged thereby, except as expressed in said permit and the conditions aforesaid.'\n\n The respondents the R. P. Andrews Paper Company and Abraham Lisner defended against the collection of the assessments, claiming that their permits to construct \n\n[256 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n were in such form as to create in each by contract a vested right of property in the vault in the street, of which they would be deprived without due process of law if they were required to pay the rental.\n To sustain this position, the respondents select from paragraph 3 of the Building Regulations, supra, the provision that 'no charge shall be made for occupancy of public space by a vault,' and that all permits are subject to revocation 'when the vault space is needed for any public use and improvement.' From paragraph 3, supra, they select the stipulation that the vault space shall be vacated when ordered by the commissioners 'or needed for public use,' and from the terms of the acceptances of the permits the provision that the commissioners may place in the vaults any construction they may 'deem necessary.' Grouping these unrelated excerpts together, it is contended that they constitute a contract on the part of the District to leave the respondents in the undisturbed possession of the vaults, free of charge, until such time as the space may be demanded because needed for some public use and improvement, and that since the act of Congress under which the disputed rental is imposed is purely a revenue measure which does not require the surrender of the space for any public use, but contemplates the continued private use of it, it is an invalid attempt to deprive the respondents of their property without due process of law.\n This statement of the contention of the respondents is it own sufficient refutation.\n In form the permit is a mere naked permission to build. Two of the three clauses relied upon to create rights of property in the streets are derived from the Building Regulations, which, as their name implies, are designed to regulate the materials of buildings and the manner of their construction and use; they are not looked to, on such a mere reference as we have here, for a grant of rights \n\n[256 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n in streets; and the third clause is from the acceptances of the permits, which are signed only by the applicants. When to this we add that, the applications culminated and ended in acceptances of the permits 'with the understanding that the occupation of the vault space is permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of the abutting premises and that no right, title and interest of the public is in any way waived or abridged thereby, except as expressed in said permit and the conditions [in the acceptances] aforesaid,' and that the settled rule of law is that the grants of rights and privileges in streets are strictly construed so that whatever is not unequivocally granted therein is withheld, and that nothing passes in such case by implication. (Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 U.S. 22\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 224; Blair v. City of Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 471\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427; Piedmont Power & Light Co. v. Town of Graham, \n253 \nU.S. 193, 194\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 453), we cannot doubt that the permits to the respondents were mere licenses, subject to revocation at any time in the discretion of the government of the District.\n The Saks & Co. Case, No. 283, is, if possible, even less substantial than the other two. Whatever rights in the streets this respondent has must be derived from the application made in 1884 for a permit to erect a building with adjacent vaults, and from the presumption of a permit, arising from the fact that a vault was constructed and has been in use ever since. No formal permit appears in the record.\n A license to Saks & Co. to construct and use the vaults, revocable at will, would be sufficient to render them unlawful constructions in the street until the privilege should be revoked, and this is all that can fairly be inferred against the public from the facts stated. Without a permit presumed the vault would be a public nuisance, but no grant of a permanent right in the street can be inferred from a mere application and use.\n The Court of Appeals gives much greater significance \n\n[256 U.S. 582, 588]\n\u00a0\n to the concluding words of the acceptances in the permits in Nos. 282 and 284, 'except as expressed in said permit and the condition aforesaid,' than we can find in them. There are certainly no limitations upon the rights of the public in the permit itself, and the conditions of acceptance here referred to were special agreements, in the acceptances, on the part of the applicants to surrender the vault space upon demand of the commissioners for special purposes and to an extent designated, which we think not inconsistent with the larger declaration with which the permit was accepted, that the occupation of the vault was a mere accommodation to the receiver of the permit and did not constitute any waiver of any right, title or interest of the public in the streets.\n Concluding, as we do, that the respondents were mere licensees, we see no reason for limiting the act of Congress, as the Court of Appeals limited it, to constructions after the date of the act. Such an interpretation of the act would so obviously result in unjust inequality that it should be adopted only under stress of imperative language which we do not find in it.\n It ressults that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District will be reversed and that of the Supreme Court affirmed in each of the cases.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEBERLEIN v. U S(1921)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 82, 83]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. E. Russell, of New York City, and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Davis and Wm. D. Harris, of Dayton, Ohio, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the plaintiff, who was a United States storekeeper in the customs service at the port of New York, brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover from the United States the sum of $4,164.44, that being the salary of the office from the date of his removal therefrom to the date of his reinstatement. The Court of Claims decided against him. 53 Ct. Cl. 466. On May 9, 1910, he was suspended without pay pending an investigation of written charges preferred against him. He had a hearing upon his answer to the charges, and on May 26, 1910, was removed from office. The charges involved the acceptance of bribes in the matter of underweighing cargoes of sugar, and thereby defrauding the government. In May, 1912, the Attorney General reinvestigated claimant's record, and reported that in his judgment the charges were \n\n[257 U.S. 82, 84]\n\u00a0\n not sustained, and the surveyor of the port made a similar report. On December 3, 1912, the President of the United States by an executive order of that date, in pursuance of further investigation, directed the reinstatement of the plaintiff. On December 6, 1912, he was reinstated.\n There can be no question, from the findings in this case, that the plaintiff had the benefit of a hearing according to the regulations then in force. The Court of Claims in its opinion stated that the subsequent investigation established his innocence of the charges made against him. But the things required by law and regulations were done, and the discretion of the authorized officers was exercised as required by law. It is settled that in such cases the action of executive officers is not subject to revision in the courts. Keim v. United States, \n117 U.S. 290\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 574.\n The order of the President could not have the effect of reinstating the plaintiff to the office from which he was removed. The power of appointment and removal was in the Secretary of the Treasury. It was within the power of Congress to confer this authority on the Secretary. Burnap v. United States, \n252 U.S. 512\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 374.\n The President's order, while reciting the wrong which had been done to the plaintiff, could have no more effect than to reinstate him to eligibility for reappointment in the government service. Indeed, such was found to be the import of the order itself, and fairly so. It provides that Eberlein may be reinstated in any appropriate classified position in the customs service in New York, without regard to the length of time he has been separated from the service. That was the purpose of the order, although it goes on to say, doubtless in fairness to Eberlein, that he was separated from the service on May 26, 1910, and charged with having accepted money from importers for underweighing merchandise, that upon rehearing the surveyor of customs of New York was of the opinion that \n\n[257 U.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n the charges had not been sustained, and that the Attorney General recommended that the plaintiff be restored to the office from which he had been dismissed. It is apparent that the President's order was intended to have no more effect than to restore him to eligibility for appointment. Such was the view of the Court of Claims, and we find no error in its judgment.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nECONOMY LIGHT & POWER CO. v.

Relief was prayed upon two grounds: ( 1) That the river bed where the dam was being constructed was the property of the United States; (2) that the Desplaines river was a navigable waterway of the United States, and the proposed construction of a dam therein was in violation of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1899 (chapter 425,  9, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151 [Comp. St.  9971]). The first ground was overruled by the District Court and disregarded by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We need not consider it further. The second ground was sustained by the District Court, and its final decree granting an injunction was \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 256 Fed. 792, 168 C.

The present appeal followed.\n Section 7 of Act of September 19, 1890 (chapter 907, 26 Stat. 426, 454), makes it unlawful to build any dam or other structure in any navigable river or other waters of the United States, so as to obstruct or impair navigation, without permission of the Secretary of War. Section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151), declares:\n'That it shall not be lawful to construct or commence the construction of any bridge, dam, dike, or causeway over or in any ... navigable river, or other navigable water of the United States until the consent of Congress to the building of such structures shall have been obtained and until the plans for the same shall have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of War: Provided, that such structures may be built under authority of the Legislature of a state across rivers and other waterways the navigable portions of which lie wholly within the limits of a single state, provided the location and plans thereof are submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of War before construction is commenced. ...'\n\n There is no contention that the consent of Congress for the building of the proposed dam has been obtained, that its construction has been authorized by the Legislature of the state of Illinois, or that the location and plans have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War. The substantial defense is that the Desplaines river, at the site of the proposed dam, which is below the city of Joliet and just above the point where the Desplaines joins the Kankakee to form the Illinois river, is not navigable in fact and not within the description 'navigable river, or other navigable water of the United States,' as employed in the act of 1899. \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n The District Court found that there was no evidence of actual navigation within the memory of living men, and that there would be no present interference with navigation by the building of the proposed dam. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not disturb this finding. 256 Fed. 792, 798, 168 C. C. A. 138. But both courts found that in its natural state the river was navigable in fact, and that it was actually used for the purposes of navigation and trading in the customary way, and with the kinds of craft ordinarily in use for that purpose on rivers of the United States, from early fur-trading days (about 1675) down to the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Details are given in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and need not be repeated. Suffice it to say that there was a well-known route by water, called the Chicago- Desplaines-Illinois route, running up the Chicago river from its mouth on Lake Michigan to a point on the west fork of the south branch; thence westerly by water or portage, according to the season, to Mud Lake, about two miles; thence to the Desplaines near Riverside, two miles; thence down the Desplaines to the confluence of that river with the Kankakee, where they form the Illinois river; thence down the Illinois to its junction with the Mississippi. During the period mentioned the fur trade was a leading branch of commerce in the western territory, and it was regularly conducted upon the Desplaines river. Supplies in large quantity and variety, needed by the early settlers, also were transported over this route between Chicago and St. Louis and other points. Canoes and other boats of various kinds were employed, having light draft, but capable of carrying several tons each, and manned by crews of six or eight men. The route was navigated by the American Fur Company regularly during a period of years down to about 1825, after which it was disused, because the trade had receded to interior portions of Illinois that could be reached \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n more conveniently with horses. Later, changes occurred in the river, due to the drainage of a swamp in the region of the portage, the clearing away of forests, affecting the rainfall and the distribution of the run-off, and thus shortening the duration of the higher stages of water; the construction (under state authority) of the Illinois & Michigan Canal in 1848 and its deepening in 1866 to 1871, which diverted a part of the hill drainage towards the Chicago river; and the construction of the Sanitary and Ship Canal in 1892 to 1894\n\n\n But, in spite of these changes, the Circuit Court of Appeals finds ( 256 Fed. 804, 168 C. C. A. 138) that the Desplaines river is a continuous stretch of water from Riverside (at the Chicago divide) to its mouth; and although there is a rapid, and in places shallow water, with boulders and obstructions, yet these things do not affect its navigable capacity; that the same is true of the upper part of the Illinois river, above the head of steamboat navigation; and that both streams are navigable and are within the act of 1899.\n Since about the year 1835 a number of dams have been built in the Desplaines, without authority from the United States, and one or more of them still remain; besides, a considerable number of bridges of various kinds span the river. The fact, however, that artificial obstructions exist capable of being abated by due exercise of the public authority, does not prevent the stream from being regarded as navigable in law, if, supposing them to be abated, it be navigable in fact in its natural state. The authority of Congress to prohibit added obstructions is not taken away by the fact that it has omitted to take action in previous cases.\n The public interest in navigable streams of this character in Illinois and neighboring states, and the federal authority over such as are capable of serving commerce among the states, does not arise from custom or implication, \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n but has a very definite origin. By article 4 of the compact in the Ordinance of July 13, 1787, for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio, it was declared:\n'The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory, as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other states that may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor.' 1 Stat. 51, 52, note; Rev. Stat. U. S. ( 1878 Ed.) pp. 13, 16.\n\n This was under the Confederation; but the first Congress under the new Constitution expressed a design to have it continue in full effect, in the Act of August 7, 1789 (chapter 8, 1 Stat. 50). A purpose to preserve the rights of public highway in the navigable rivers was again manifested in section 9 of Act of May 18, 1796 (chapter 29, 1 Stat. 464, 468 [Comp. St.  4918]). The territory of Indiana (including what is now Illinois) was set apart and organized by Act of May 7, 1800, which in section 2 reiterated that purpose (chapter 41, 2 Stat. 58, 59); and in an act providing for the disposal of the public lands therein (Act of March 26, 1804, c. 35,  6, 2 Stat. 277, 279, 280), it was again declared 'that all the navigable rivers, creeks, and waters, within the Indiana Territory, shall be deemed to be and remain public highways.' Illinois was set apart and a separate territorial government established therein by Act of February 3, 1809 (chapter 13, 2 Stat. 514). By section 2, the government was to be 'in all respects similar' to that provided by the Ordinance of 1787 and the Act of August 7, 1789, and the inhabitants were to enjoy all the rights, privileges, and conditions granted by the Ordinance. An act to enable the people of Illinois to form a state government, approved April 18, 1818 (chapter 67, 3 Stat. 428), contained a proviso (section 4, p. 430) that such government should not be repugnant to the Ordinance of 1787. The state constitution declared its purpose to \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n be consistent with the Ordinance, and the resolution of Congress declaring admission of the state into the Union (Res. Dec. 3, 1818, 3 Stat. 536) acknowledged that the constitution and state government were 'in conformity to the principles of the articles of compact' in the Ordinance of 1787.\n There can be doubt that the waters of the Chicago-Desplaines-Illinois route 'and the carrying places between the same' constituted one of the routes of commerce intended by the Ordinance, and the subsequent acts referred to, to be maintained as common highways. It did not make them navigable in law unless they were navigable in fact, but declared the public rights therein so far as they were navigable in fact; and it is curious and interesting that the importance of these inland waterways, and the inappropriateness of the tidal test in defining our navigable waters, was thus recognized by the Congress of the Confederation more than 80 years before this court decided The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563; and more than 60 years before The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, 455.\n To the extent that it pertained to internal affairs, the Ordinance of 1787-notwithstanding its contractual form-was no more than a regulation of territory belonging to the United States, and was superseded by the admission of the state of Illinois into the Union 'on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever.' Permoli v. First Municipality, 3 How. 589, 610 (11 L. Ed. 739); Van Brocklin v. State of Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151, 159\n, 6 S. Sup.Ct. 670; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 \nU.S. 210, 217\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637. But, so far as it established public rights of highway in navigable waters capable of bearing commerce from state to state, it did not regulate internal affairs alone, and was no more capable of repeal by one of the states than any other regulation of interstate commerce enacted by the Congress; being analogous in this respect to legislation enacted under the exclusive power \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n of Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes. Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 229, 230; Ex parte Webb, \n225 \nU.S. 663, 683\n, 690 S., 691, 32 Sup. Ct. 769; United States v. Sandoval, \n231 \nU.S. 28, 38\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 1.\n Nothing inconsistent with this was decided in Escanaba Co. v. Chicago, \n107 \nU.S. 678, 688\n, 689 S., 2 Sup. Ct. 185; Huse v. Glover, \n119 \nU.S. 543, 546\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 313; Sands v. Manistee River Imp. Co., \n123 \nU.S. 288, 295\n, 296 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 113; Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, \n125 U.S. 1\n, 8-11, 8 Sup. Ct. 811. Those cases simply hold, in effect, that a state formed out of a part of the Northwest Territory has the same power to regulate navigable waters within its borders that is possessed by other states of the Union; that is to say, until Congress intervenes, the power of the state, locally exerted, is plenary. Nevertheless, where the navigation serves commerce among the states or with foreign nations, Congress has the supreme power when it chooses to act, and is not prevented, by anything the states may have done, from assuming entire control in the matter. In short, that the rule laid down in Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245, 252, and Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 731, applies to states formed out of the Northwest Territory as well as to others. This is not questioned. But, as was recognized in the Gilman Case ( page 731), Congress may exercise its authority through general as well as through special laws, its power in either case being supreme. The act of 1899 (30 Stat. 1151), upon which the present bill is founded, is a due assertion of the authority of Congress over all navigable waters within its jurisdiction; and it must be accorded due weight as such.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in passing upon the question of navigability, correctly applied the test laid down by this court in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563, and The Montello, 20 Wall. 430, 440-443; that is, the test whether the river, in its natural state, is used, or capable of being used as a highway for commerce, over which \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 122]\n\u00a0\n trade and travel is or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water. Navigability, in the sense of the law, is not destroyed because the water course is interrupted by occasional natural obstructions or portages; nor need the navigation be open at all seasons of the year, or at all stages of the water.\n In the Montello, supra, the question was whether Fox river, in the state of Wisconsin, was a navigable water of the United States within the meaning of acts of Congress. Originally there were rapids and falls in the river, but these had been obviated by locks, canals, and dams, so as to furnish an uninterrupted water communication for steam vessels of a considerable capacity. It was argued (20 Wall. 440) that although since these improvements the river might be considered as a highway for commerce conducted in the ordinary modes, it was not so in its natural state, and therefore not navigable under the decision in The Daniel Ball, supra. The court, accepting navigability in the natural state of the river as the correct test, proceeded to show that, before the improvements resulting in an unbroken navigation, and when a few portages were necessary, a large and successful interstate commerce had been carried through the river by means of Durham boats; and, speaking by Mr. Justice Davis, proceeded to say (20 Wall. 441) that, even aside from the Ordinance of 1787:\n'The true test of the navigability of a stream does not depend on the mode by which commerce is, or may be, conducted, nor the difficulties attending navigation. If this were so, the public would be deprived of the use of many of the large rivers of the country over which rafts of lumber of great value are constantly taken to market. It would be a narrow rule to hold that in this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated by steam or sail vessels, it could not be treated as a public highway. The capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true criterion of the \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 123]\n\u00a0\n navigability of a river, rather than the extent and manner of that use. If it be capable in its natural state of being used for purposes of commerce, no matter in what mode the commerce may be conducted, it is navigable in fact, and becomes in law a public river or highway.'\n\n Proceeding to say (20 Wall. 442) that notwithstanding the fact that before the improvements there were obstructions to an unbroken navigation, which rendered the navigation difficult and prevented the adoption of modern agencies, commerce was successfully carried on, the court pointed out (20 Wall. 442) that the Ordinance of 1787 recognized 'carrying places' as a part of a navigable waterway.\n Our attention is called to the fact that in People v. Economy Power Co., 241 Ill. 290, 320-388, 89 N. E. 760, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that the Desplaines in its natural condition is not a navigable stream; and it is intimated that we ought to follow that decision. A writ of error brought to review it was dismissed by us because no federal question was involved. \n234 \nU.S. 497, 510\n, 524 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 973. Of course, the decision does not render the matter res judicata, as the United States was not a party. The District Court in the present case treated it as not persuasive, because it appeared that evidence was wanting which is present here; and we cannot say that the court below erred in not following it.\n We concur in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that a river having actual navigable capacity in its natural state and capable of carrying commerce among the states is within the power of Congress to preserve for purposes of future transportation, even though it be not at present used for such commerce, and be incapable of such use according to present methods, either by reason of changed conditions or because of artificial obstructions. And we agree that the provisions of section 9 of the Act of 1899 (30 Stat. 1151) apply to such a stream. The act in terms applies to 'any ... navigable river, or other \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 124]\n\u00a0\n navigable water of the United States'; and, without doing violence to its manifest purpose, we cannot limit its prohibition to such navigable waters as were, at the time of its passage, or now are, actually open for use. The Desplaines river, after being of practical service as a highway of commerce for a century and a half, fell into disuse, partly through changes in the course of trade or methods of navigation, or changes in its own condition, partly as the result of artificial obstructions. In consequence, it has been out of use for a hundred years; but a hundred years is a brief space in the life of a nation. Improvements in the methods of water transportation or increased cost in other methods of transportation may restore the usefulness of this stream; since it is a natural interstate waterway, it is within the power of Congress to improve it at the public expense; and it is not difficult to believe that many other streams are in like condition and require only the exertion of federal control to make them again important avenues of commerce among the states. If they are to be abandoned, it is for Congress, not the courts, so to declare. The policy of Congress is clearly evidenced in the act of 1899, and, in the present case at least, nothing remains but to give effect to it.\n It is contended that, supposing the Desplaines is navigable, the purpose of the act of 1899 was in effect accomplished because appellant or its predecessor, before proceeding with the enterprise, submitted the plans for the proposed dam to the War Department, and that department 'in substance gave its approval,' although it did not formally approve the plans because it did not consider the Desplaines river a navigable water of the United States. It appears, however, that there was no application for an approval under the act of 1899, and the Department was not called upon to exercise its jurisdiction under that act. There was an informal hearing before the Secretary, at which the representatives of \n\n[256 U.S. 113, 125]\n\u00a0\n appellant, assuring him that the Desplaines was not a navigable stream either in law or in fact, and that the department had no jurisdiction over it, asked not for a permit, but in effect for an assurance that no permit was necessary. The Secretary declined to act because, as the river was not navigable, he had no jurisdiction. We cannot regard this as equivalent to an approval, either in form or effect, or even as an official inquiry into the navigability of the river.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEL BANCO POPULAR DE ECONOMIAS Y PRESTAMOS DE SAN JUAN, P R V.(1921)\nNo. 91\nArgued: November 12, 1920Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Boyd B. Jones, of Boston, Mass., for appellant. \n\n[255 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ben A. Matthews, of New York City, and Jose R. F. Savage, of San Juan, P. R., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a suit in the United States District Court for Porto Rico where the appellant, a bank incorporated in Porto Rico, was plaintiff, and the appellee, a citizen of the United States, was defendant, a final decree in favor of the bank was rendered, and from that decree the defendant took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. \n\n[255 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n Upon a reversal of the decree in that court, the bank brought this appeal, and upon a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction we are required to determine its right to do so. The appellant, not denying that the jurisdiction of this court to review judgments or decrees of the District Court for Porto Rico in cases such as the present one was taken away by the act conferring upon the Circuit Court of Appeals of the First Circuit appellate power over that subject (Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22,  1 [ Comp. St.  1107]; Id.  2, amending sections 128 and 238 Judicial Code [ Comp. St.  1120, 1215]; Id.  3, repealing section 244, Judicial Code [ 36 Stat. 1157]; 38 Stat. 803, 804), nevertheless insists that by virtue of the jurisdiction of this court to review judgments and decrees of the Circuit Courts of Appeals, the power taken away is in substance preserved if only successive appeals be resorted to. This rests upon the proposition that, as the act transferring the jurisdiction from this to the Circuit Court of Appeals brought this case within the jurisdiction of the latter court, it hence subjected the decree in this case to the test of finality and the right of review provided in section 128 of the Judicial Code controlling those subjects. While if the section be considered superficially the argument is plausible, its unsoundness becomes apparent by the briefest examination of the context and genesis of the section. Virtually every word of the section relied upon to establish that the decree was not final and to justify the asserted right to review it in this court depends upon limitations expressed in the Judiciary Act of 1891 , (26 Stat. 826), and which were intended to carry out the great purposes of that act, to distribute the appellate power of the courts of the United States in the proper sense and were therefore inapplicable to the Porto Rican court. To illustrate, one of the broad distinctions made in the distribution of appellate power under the act of 1891 depended upon whether the jurisdiction of the federal court as fixed by law was exclusively called into play because of diverse \n\n[255 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n citizenship, in the constitutional sense, or whether the jurisdiction was invoked because, aside from diverse citizenship, there existed a federal right or question; a judgment being in one case made final in one court where it was not in the other, and also being subject to one method of review in the one and a different in the other. Thus the proposition is that, because by Act of Congress jurisdiction was conferred upon the Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judgment of the Porto Rican court, therefore by the mere exertion of that jurisdiction the Porto Rican judgment was brought under the control, as to finality and review, of provisions having no possible application or relation to it.\n The act of Congress by which jurisdiction was conferred upon the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit additionally makes clear the misconception upon which the argument rests. At the time that act was passed the jurisdiction of this court to review the Porto Rican court embraced two classes of cases, the one involving enumerated federal questions, in the true sense, and the other where the power depended upon the amount involved. Section 244, Judicial Code. But the transferring act did not divest this court of appellate jurisdiction over the Porto Rican court, but on the contrary preserved its authority, although in some respects limiting and in others enlarging it, and transferred to the Circuit Courts of Appeals appellate jurisdiction in all cases other than those in which jurisdiction by direct appeal was conferred upon this court, unless otherwise provided by law-a result which clearly negates that it was contemplated that a right to successive appeals should exist, and which, moreover, indisputably shows that it was the purpose of Congress not to give the Circuit Court of Appeals an authority which it could not exert compatibly with the distribution of federal appellate judicial power made by the act of 1891. \n\n[255 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n Indeed, we might well have spared ourselves the duty of expressing the considerations we have stated since the proposition relied upon in virtually foreclosed by the ruling in Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co. v. Ward, \n242 U.S. 1\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 1. There a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, affirming a judgment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, was brought here by appeal on the theory of the right to successive appeals now relied upon. Coming to consider whether there was jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, and pointing out a reservation of jurisdiction in this court made by the act transferring authority to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit to review the Hawaiian court, similar in character to that made with reference to the Porto Rican court which we have previously noticed, it was held that there was no jurisdiction in this court: (a) Because of the inferences properly to be drawn from the reservation in the act of Congress just referred to; (b) because of the impossibility of supposing that jurisdiction was taken away from this court and yet virtually restored by successive appeals; and (c) because of the difference between the systems of judicature obtaining as to the courts of the United States under the Constitution and those of Hawaii making the right to review in the one depend upon legislative limitations not governing as to the other.\n It follows from what we have said, and from the principles sustained by the ruling in the case just stated, that we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal which is before us, and it must be and is, therefore,\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELDORADO COAL & MINING CO. v.

The company retained its accounts receivable and prior to September 30, 1917, it distributed among its stockholders, proportionately to their ownership of stocks, the cash received from the sale and the accounts receivable in kind. The corporation, however, was not dissolved nor its charter surrendered, because there were unsettled liabilities against it for federal income taxes and excess profit taxes. Otherwise its affairs were wound up.\n It is averred in the declaration that, taking the fair market value as of March 1, 1913, of the capital assets of the company invested and employed in its business, and adding thereto the cost of additions and betterments, and subtracting depreciation and depletion to the date of sale, it appears that there was an appreciation in value of the property after March 1, 1913, of $5,986.02, and it was on this profit realized by the sale that the assessment of $3,073.16 was made which the company paid and in this suit seeks to recover.\n It is obvious from this statement of the case that it presents in so nearly the same form precisely the same questions as were considered in No. 608, Merchants' Loan & Trust Co., etc., v.

The Erie Railroad's line in Paterson is over tracks originally belonging to the President and Directors of the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad Company and the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad Company, but now held by the Erie Railroad, by assignment of perpetual leases upon the terms that if in any unforeseen way the leases terminate the value of erections and improvements must be repaid by the lessors. They however are small corporations having no assets except their roads and the rentals received from the Erie Company. The leases were ratified by an Act of March 14, 1853 (P. L. 480), providing that they should not be held to confer any privilege or right not granted to the lessors by their charters. It is admitted that the statute must be taken to impose the duty of making the changes upon the company operating the road, the plaintiff in error, which is an interstate road. It put in evidence that it did not have assets sufficient to make the changes, at least without interfering with the proper development of its interstate commerce, and also contended that the whole evidence did not justify the finding of the Board that the crossings were dangerous to public safety but at most showed that \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 409]\n\u00a0\n the change would be a public convenience. It is said that the order must be reasonable to be upheld and that it is not reasonable to require an expenditure for such a purpose of over two million dollars from a company that has not more than $100,000 available, and that the order and the statute when construed to justify it not only interfere unwarrantably with interstate commerce and impair the obligation of contracts but take the Erie Company's property without due process of law.\n Most of the streets concerned were laid out later than the railroads and this fact is relied upon, so far as it goes, as an additional reason for denying the power of the State to throw the burden of this improvement upon the railroad. That is the fundamental question in the case. It might seem to be answered by the summary of the decisions given in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis, \n232 \nU.S. 430, 438\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 400, 401 (58 L. Ed. 671). 'It is well settled that railroad corporations may be required, at their own expense, not only to abolish existing grade crossings but also to build and maintain suitable bridges or viaducts to carry highways, newly laid out, over their tracks or to carry their tracks over such highways.' Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Omaha, \n235 U.S. 121\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 82; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Puget Sound & Willapa Harbor Ry. Co., \n250 U.S. 332\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 474. For although the statement is said to be explained as a matter of state law by the previous decisions in Minnesota, it is made without reference to those decisions or to any local rule, and moreover the intimation of the judgment in the present case is that whatever may have been the eariler rulings the law of New Jersey now adopts the same view.\n But it is argued that the order is unreasonable in the circumstances to which we have adverted, the principle applied to the regulation of public service corporations being invoked. Mississippi R. R. Commission v. Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 602; Chicago, \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 410]\n\u00a0\n Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Railroad Commissioners of Wisconsin, \n237 U.S. 220\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 560. But the extent of the States' power varies in different cases from absolute to qualified, somewhat as the privilege in respect of inflicting pecuniary damage varies. The power of the State over grade crossings derives little light from cases on the power to regulate trains.\n Grade crossings call for a necessary adjustment of two conflicting interests-that of the public using the streets and that of the railroads and the public using them. Generically the streets represent the more important interest of the two. There can be no doubt that they did when these railroads were laid out, or that the advent of automobiles has given them an additional claim to consideration. They always are the necessity of the whole public, which the railroads, vital as they are, hardly can be called to the same extent. Being places to which the public is invited and that it necessarily frequents, the State, in the care of which this interest is and from which, ultimately, the railroads derive their right to occupy the land, has a constitutional right to insist that they shall not be made dangerous to the public, whatever may be the cost to the parties introducing the danger. That is one of the most obvious cases of the police power, or to put the same proposition in another form, the authority of the railroads to project their moving masses across thoroughfares must be taken to be subject to the implied limitation that it may be cut down whenever and so far as the safety of the public requires. It is said that if the same requirement were made for the other grade crossings of the road it would soon be bankrupt. That the States might be so foolish as to kill a goose that lays golden eggs for them, has no bearing on their constitutional rights. If it reasonably can be said that safety requires the change it is for them to say whether they will insist upon it, and neither prospective bankruptcy \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 411]\n\u00a0\n nor engagement in interstate commerce can take away this fundamental right of the sovereign of the soil. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co. v. Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 246\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 450. To engage in interstate commerce the railroad must get on to the land and to get on to it must comply with the conditions imposed by the State for the safety of its citizens. Contracts made by the road are made subject to the possible exercise of the sovereign right. Denver & Rio. Grande R. R. Co. v. Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 244\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 450; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Co., \n248 U.S. 372\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 117; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 264, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Duluth, \n208 U.S. 583\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 341; Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 127. If the burdens imposed are so great that the road cannot be run at a profit it can stop, whatever the misfortunes the stopping may produce. Brooks- Scanlon Co. v. R. R. Commissioners, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183. Intelligent self-interest should lead to a careful consideration of what the road is able to do without ruin, but this is not a constitutional duty. In the opinion of the Courts below the evidence justified the conclusion of the Board that the expense would not be ruinous. Many details as to the particular situation of this road are disposed of without the need of further mention by what we have said thus far.\n The plaintiff in error discusses with considerable detail the effect of the changes upon private sidings. But its rights in respect of these are at least no greater than those in respect of the main line and are covered by the preceding discussion. So are the objections that if the leases ever are terminated it has no chance of being repaid the value of its improvements because of the smallness of the lessor corporations. They would have this property in that event and it would be subject to their obligation-but the answer to the complaint of the plaintiff in error in all its forms is that which we have made. Whatever the cost, it may be required by New Jersey not to im \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 412]\n\u00a0\n peril the highways if it does business there. We agree with the decisions below that as the railroad company might have been charged with the whole expense the fact that no more than ten per centum of the cost of three crossings is thrown upon a street railway company is a matter of which it cannot complain.\n If we could see that the evidence plainly did not warrant a finding that the particular crossings were dangerous there might be room for the argument that the order was so unreasonable as to be void. The number of accidents shown was small and if we went upon that alone we well might hesitate. But the situation is one that always is dangerous. The Board must be supposed to have known the locality and to have had an advantage similar to that of a Judge who sees and hears the witnesses. The Courts of the State have confirmed its judgment. The tribunals were not bound to await a collision that might cost the road a sum comparable to the cost of the change. If they were reasonably warranted in their conclusion their judgment must stand. We cannot say that they were not. At some crossings the danger was less than at others, but it was necessary or at least prudent to proceed on a general plan. Upon the whole matter while it is difficult to avoid the apprehension that the state officials hardly gave due weight to the situation of the company as a whole in their anxiety for the well being of the State, we are of opinion that they did not exceed their constitutional powers. The order should be regarded as stating a condition that must be complied with if the company continues to use the New Jersey soil. Probably the conclusion that we have reached could be supported upon the narrower ground that a continuing obligation was imposed by the charters of the plaintiff in error's lessors, and was assumed by the plaintiff in error, but that which we have stated seems to us free from doubt.\n Some argument is based upon a discretion supposed \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 413]\n\u00a0\n to be left to the Board by the statute, which reads that when it appears to the Board that the crossing is dangerous it may order, &c. The state courts seem to regard the words as imposing a positive duty, but upon either construction we perceive no infraction of the company's constitutional rights. If the words are imperative the reasons that we have given apply. If they leave a discretion it is subject to review by the Courts, and this Court has no concern with the question how far legislative or quasi-legislative powers may be delegated to a Commission or Board. Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 U.S. 539\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 217, L. R. A. 1917F, 514, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 643; Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 U.S. 128\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 190; Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 225\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67. We deem it unnecessary to give our reasons in greater detail for deciding that the judgment against the Erie Railroad Company must be affirmed.\n While the Railroad Company contends that the Public Service Railway Company should be charged more, the latter company comes here upon the proposition that it should be charged nothing. We agree with the Courts below that a street railway crossing the tracks of a steam road at grade in a public street increases the danger and may be required to bear a part of the expense of removing it. The amount charged does not appear to be excessive and upon the principles that we have laid down the payment of it may be made a condition of the continued right to use the streets. Detroit, Fort Wayne & Belle Isle Ry. v. Osborn, \n189 \nU.S. 383, 390\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 540; Missouri Racific Ry. Co. v. Omaha, \n235 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 82.\n The Passaic Water Company contends that the expense of moving its pipes cannot be thrown wholly upon it-mainly on the ground that the change of grade was unlawful. This ground fails and the company must adjust itself to the lawfully changed conditions. It also contends that it does not receive the equal protection of the laws because the street railway instead of being charged \n\n[254 U.S. 394, 414]\n\u00a0\n the expense of moving its tracks is charged ten per centum of the total expense at its crossings. Presumably this charge is greater than the mere adjustment of tracks to a new surface. It is based upon the share of the street railroad in creating the danger. As the street railroad cannot complain, certainly the Water Company cannot.\n The Western Union Telegraph Company makes similar objections and also says that its interstate commerce is interfered with and presents from its own point of view arguments dealt with so far as they seem to us to need mention in disposing of the principal case. The other plaintiffs in error own side tracks which will be dislocated by the change and they will be put to further expense if the plan is carried out according to what the New Jersey Court decides to be suggestions not commands. The rights in the side tracks are subordinate to changes in the main track otherwise lawful. As against these as against the others the judgment of the Court of Errors and Appeals is affirmed.\n Judgments affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEUGENE SOL LOUIE v.

St.  10446) in the District Court of the United States for the District of Idaho, Northern Division, for the murder of another Indian within the limits of the Coeur d'Alene reservation. A motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was overruled and the defendant was tried and convicted. By motion in arrest of judgment, he objected in terms to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of defendant and over the crime charged on the ground that before the time of the alleged crime he had been declared competent and the land on which the crime was alleged to have been committed had been allotted and deeded to him in fee simple. Compare United States v. Celestine, \n215 U.S. 278\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 93. This motion also was overruled, the defendant was sentenced, and the case was taken on writ of error to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That court, one judge dissenting, dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction on the ground that, since the sole question presented was whether the District Court had jurisdiction, its decision could be reviewed only by direct writ of error from this court to the District Court. See United States v. Jahn, \n155 \nU.S. 109, 114\n, 115 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 39. Compare Raton Waterworks Co. v. City of Raton, \n249 U.S. 552\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 384.

Ct. 587.\n We have no occasion to consider the question on which the Circuit Court of Appeals divided. The motions made by defendant in the District Court raised a question, not of the jurisdiction of that court, but of the jurisdiction of the United States. The contention was, in essence, that, by reason of the facts set forth in the motions, the defendant was in respect to the acts complained of subject to the laws of the state of Idaho and not to the laws of the United States; in other words, that he did not violate the laws of the United States. Compare United States v. Kiya (D. C.) 126 Fed. 879, 880. Section 328 of the Penal Code (Comp. St.  10502) provides that an Indian committing murder on another Indian 'within the boundaries of any state, and within the limits of any Indian reservation, shall be subject ... to the same penalties as are all other persons committing' the same crime 'within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' United States v. Kagama, \n118 U.S. 375\n 6 Sup. Ct. 1109; Donnelly v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 269\n, 270 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710. The defendant, in effect, denied that the killing was, in the statutory sense, within the reservation. If this was true, an essential element of the crime against the United States was lacking; as much so as if it had been established in United States v. Sutton, \n215 U.S. 291\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 116, or in United States v. Soldana, \n246 U.S. 530\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 357, that the region into which liquor was introduced was not Indian country. That the District Court for Idaho had jurisdiction to determine whether the locus in quo was a part of the reservation was not questioned. By Section 78 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1063) the whole state of Idaho is comprised within the District of Idaho; by paragraph second of section 24 (section 991) District Courts have original jurisdiction of all \n\n[254 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n Since defendant's motions in the District Court did not raise a question properly of the jurisdiction of the court, but went to the merits, there was no basis for a direct writ of error from this court.

Acts of 1919, Extraordinary Session, c. 5. It is set up that the statute is contrary to the Constitution of the United States in several ways, one of these being that as applied to the plaintiff it imposes a tax upon commerce among the States. The plaintiff owns a system of pipe lines in West Virginia connecting with other pipe lines in Ohio and Kentucky on the west and in Pennsyivania on the east of the State. Through the plaintiff's pipes oil flows in a continuous stream to the State line and beyond-in all amounting to over twenty-two million barrels in the year ending June 30, 1919. There are four \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 270]\n\u00a0\n grades of the oil thus moved. Two of these are produced partly in West Virginia. According to the figures accepted by the defendants in error, out of a total 9,076,599.83 barrels of the Pennsylvania grade 6,510,081.51 barrels came from this State, upon over six millions of which the plaintiff made a charge of twenty, later thirty, cents for gathering, on an interstate tariff and also under a local statute. But all the oil of the same grade was mixed, regardless of source, and of the Pennsylvania grade only 1,239,099.55 barrels were used in West Virginia. It is admitted that the tax may be levied in respect of the last item, but the question before us is whether the tax can be laid upon the whold product of the State upon which was imposed the gathering charge.\n The Circuit Court of the State held that the statute was void. The Supreme Court of Appeals sustained it so far as the oil produced in West Virginia was concerned. But as the Court declared that the act should be construed to apply only to commerce within the State it is urged that there is no jurisdiction here of the writ of error because there is no question as to the validity of a statute so limited. The plaintiff in error also applied for a writ of certiorari so that the objection would be immaterial were we not required to determine upon which proceeding the decree should issue. In view of that necessity we dispose of the matter before going further. Upon the declaration of the Court we may conjecture that if it had considered that the oil in question moved in interstate commerce it would have agreed with the Court below, and on this ground it is argued that the mistake, if any, was not in approving the statute but in the Court's conception of interstate commerce. But we must look at what the Court has done, not at its mode of reaching the result. What it has done is to decide that the statute covers all the oil produced in West Virginia and that it shall be upheld in so doing. The nature of the mistake that induced \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 271]\n\u00a0\n the act is immaterial. A case would not be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of this Court in error by a declaration that a statute was addressed only to intrastate commerce if it was applied wholesale to freight passing across the continent. The fact that the error was less does not affect the principle involved. But furthermore the Court only confined the statute to intrastate commerce 'as above defined,' that is, to commerce that embraced what the plaintiff carried on.\n We return to the facts affecting the merits. When oil is received from the producer he receives a credit on the books of the plaintiff pipe line, and thereafter is charged for storage, as it is called, the plaintiff being required by the laws of West Virginia to keep enough oil in its tanks and pipes to satisfy such credits. Code, 1913,  3564. If the producer desires to deliver oil outside the State it hands to the pipe line company what is called a tender of shipment for so many barrels of the specified kind of oil, naming the consignee, and expressed to be subject to an identified tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. This is said to be a joint tariff in which the connecting carriers share, but they do not share in the twenty or thirty cents charged for gathering the oil. The argument for the defendants in error of course is that the producer is free to sell within or without the State and that, the movement of gathering having taken place before any order is given and while the producer still can do as he likes, it must be regarded as intrastate.\n It does not seem to matter for the question before us whether the delivery to the pipe line be regarded as making it the owner of what it receives and a debtor for the amounts, as in the case of a bank, or as akin to those transactions that are held to make the recipient a bailee of the mingled mass and the bailors tenants in common, as seems to have been assumed. Whether debtor or bailee the pipe line controls the movement of any specific oil in \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 272]\n\u00a0\n its hands and the bailor assents to its doing so. The bailor assents to its becoming part of a stream that is puring through and out of the State. Its only right is to call on the pipe line to divert a portion of that stream. So far as the oil that it calls for goes out of the State with the general current it seems to us not to be distinguishable from the rest admitted to move in interstate commerce. No bailor has title to any specific oil, and to deny the character of interstate commerce to the whole stream simply because some one might have called for a delivery that probably would have been made from it in an enent that did not happen is going too far. The charges for gathering and storage seem to us not to affect the case. The storage merely means that enough oil must be kept in the tanks and pipes to satisfy credits. The oil runs into a tank on one side and out on the other. The tank may be regarded as a pipe of larger size. Whether the plaintiff in error was right or wrong in relying upon State law for its gathering charge its attitude does not matter here.\n As has been repeated many times, interstate commerce is a practical conception, and, as remarked by the court of first instance, a tax to be valid 'must not in its practical effect and operation burden interstate commerce.' It appears to us as a practical matter that the transmission of this stream of oil was interstate commerce from the beginning of the flow, and that it was none the less so that if different orders had been received by the pipe line it would have changed the destination upon which the oil was started and at which it in fact arrived. We repeat that the pipe line company not the producer was the master of the destination of any specific oil. Therefore its intent and action determined the character of the movement from its beginning, and neither the intent nor the direction of the movement changed.\n Decree reversed.\n Writ of certiorari denied. \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n I greatly regret that I cannot concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court in this case, and I think it is duty to state briefly as I may the grounds of my dissent.\n The Eureka Pipe Line Company is a West Virginia corporation, owning pipe lines which are wholly within that State. Of the twenty-two and a half millions of barrels of oil which the company transported in the year in controversy, ending July 1, 1919, six and one-half millions of barrels were produced in West Virginia and the remainder came from other Southern and Western States. Of that produced in West Virginia, one and one-quarter millions of barrels were delivered to refineries in that State, and the balance was delivered to connecting carriers, at the state line, for interstate transportation. There is no controversy as to the oil from other States or as to the state-produced oil that was delivered to refineries in the State, but to the holding of the Court that the state- produced oil, which ultimately went out of the State, moved in interstate commerce from the time it left the wells, I cannot agree.\n The company owns about forty-three hundred miles of pipe line in West Virginia, all of which, with the exception of a few hundred miles of main or trunk line, is used for the purpose of 'gathering' oil from twenty- seven counties of the State-it covers them as with a network.\n The admitted method of doing business was as follows: When the oil was delivered by the producer to the company, it issued to him what is called a 'credit balance,' which was a paper reciting that he had credit on its books for the designated number of barrels of oil and it contained a blank for the entry of 'storage charges.' The oil thus delivered moved to some one of several points on the main lines of the company, all within the State and designated in the record as 'central points,' or 'delivery \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 274]\n\u00a0\n points,' or 'tariff points.' This movement of the oil was under a tariff filed by the company with the State Public Service Commission, which, in the year under discussion, read:\n'Local Tariff. The rates named in this tariff are for intrastate transportation of crude petroleum.'\n\n'For gathering and transporting oil from wells to delivery points within the State of West Virginia, 20 cents. Storage, per day, 1\/40 cent.'\n\n Thus, by the contract between the parties, the oil was received for transportation to points within the State only. No consignee or destination was named, but, on the contrary, a charge was provided for indefinite storage, which the record shows was often paid, and the parties united in calling this part of the transportation a 'Local and an intrastate shipment.'\n Further, in order to give the oil any intrastate delivery the owner was required to issue to the company a paper called a 'delivery order,' but, if he wished it to move in interstate commerce he must deliver to the company an entirely different order called a 'tender of shipment,' which was a paper naming a place of delivery outside the State and reciting that the transportation should be under a designated interstate tariff.\n All transportation of the oil before the issuing of the 'tender of shipment' was under the local tariff described. It was not released for transportation or delivery of any kind, either state or interstate, until a 'delivery order' or a 'tender of shipment' was delivered to the company by the owner and when the latter was delivered the oil moved thereafter under the terms of another, a joint interstate tariff, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington by the Eureka Company, in conjunction with other companies owning lines connecting with its mains at the state line. \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 275]\n\u00a0\n To this we must add that, as a West Virginia corporation, the Eureka Company was subject to the statute of that State, requiring that any company engaged in the transportation of petroleum in the State shall not in any manner ship or transport, or permit to be shipped or transported, or in any manner remove from the tanks or pipe lines of such company, any petroleum without a written order (a 'delivery order' for intrastate, or a 'tender of shipment' for interstate, delivery), and also that 'every such company shall, at all times, have in its tanks and pipes an amount of oil equal to the aggregate outstanding ... credit balances on the books thereof.'\n If this were all there was in the transaction, plainly the oil could not be considered as moving in interstate commerce until a 'tender of shipment' was issued, for until that time it was without a consignee or destination and was held under a local tariff, providing a rate of twenty cents per barrel for intrastate transportation, and a charge for storage.\n But the Court concludes that this plainly intrastate shipment is converted into an interstate shipment by a single circumstance, viz. that when the oil, thus moving under a local tariff for a local charge, reached the trunk line, if that line happened to be 'running' oil of the same kind and quality, the local oil was turned into the main and was at once moved out of the State, even though a 'tender of shipment' may not have been issued to release it and give it destination. It is to be noted, however, that if the company was not 'running' oil of the like kind and quality when the local oil reached the trunk line, it was held at the junction ( tariff point) until like oil was to be 'run' again, when it was sent forward. This may have been for a day or for two weeks.\n This circumstance, that the oil became under these conditions a 'part of a stream that is pouring through \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 276]\n\u00a0\n and out of the State,' it is held, gave the shipment an interstate character from the moment it left the wells. This holding is adopted, says the Court, as a 'practical conception' of the matter, but it is precisely because it seems to me a too highly technical conception to find place in the world of practical business, that I dissent from such a conclusion. It is true that the physical oil moved, as stated, out of the State, but its removal without a tender of shipment caused no reduction whatever in the volume of like oil in the State; that volume, by the statute, by the contract of the parties and by the tariff filed by the company, must continue undiminished to meet all outstanding 'credit balances,' and the evidence of the assistant superintendent of the company is that this requirement was constantly complied with. The conclusion of the Court, therefore, allows the mere business convenience of the company (it saves storage tankage) to convert into interstate commerce that which all the parties, by their contract and conduct treated, and charged and paid for, as an intrastate transportation, and thereby subordinates, in my judgment, the substance to the merest form of the transaction.\n Believing, as I do, that this transporting of oil over approximately four thousand miles of 'gathering' lines in the State to the trunk lines was a local shipment, as the parties all declared it to be, I think the State should be permitted to impose a reasonable license or occupation tax upon the company engaged in such extensive state activity, measured by the volume of such traffic, and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia restraining the statute to this scope should be affirmed.\n For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in No. 30 of this term, Dahnke-Walker Milling Co., Plaintiff in Error, v. C. T. Bondurant, \n257 U.S. 282\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 106, I think this case is subject to review in this Court only upon writ of certiorari, \n\n[257 U.S. 265, 277]\n\u00a0\n and that, therefore, the motion to dismiss the writ of error should have been granted, but it has seemed to me important to discuss, as I have done, the question of interstate commerce involved.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS join in this opinion as to the merits of the controversy. Mr. Justice BRANDEIS also concurs as to the question of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE CHICAGO, R I & P R CO(1921)\nNo. 24\nArgued: December 13, 1920Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell and William L. Day, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. George D. Welles, of Toledo, Ohio, and Thurlow M. Gordon, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, commonly called the Rock Island, filed in this court a petition in which it alleged that the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, was undertaking to proceed against it personally in a suit therein pending; that the Rock Island had not voluntarily become a party to the suit, had not been served with process, and could not, under section 51 of the Judicial \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n Code (Comp. St.  1033), be made a party without its consent, since it was organized under the laws of Illinois and Iowa, and was not a citizen or resident of Ohio; and it prayed for a writ of prohibition, or in the alternative a writ of mandamus, to prevent the court from proceeding further against it. The suit in which it is sought to proceed personally against the Rock Island is one brought by an Indiana stockholder of the Toledo, St. Louis & Western Railroad Company, an Ohio corporation, for the appointment of a receiver for that corporation. The particular proceeding by which the personal liability is asserted is a cross-bill which was filed by the Toledo Company against the Rock Island after the appointment of the receiver, and after the Rock Island had appeared before a special master for the purpose of protecting its interests in an issue of the Toledo Company's its interests in an issue of the Toledo Company's case is now before us on the petition and return. The main questions argued here were whether upon the facts there stated the Rock Island had become a party to the suit and subjected itself generally to the jurisdiction of the court; and, if it had not, whether the case is one which entitles the petitioner to either of the extraordinary remedies applied for.\n There is a well-settled rule by which this court is guided upon applications for a writ of prohibition to prevent a lower court from wrongfully assuming jurisdiction of a party, of a cause, or of some collateral matter arising therein. If the lower court is clearly without jurisdiction, the writ will ordinarily be granted to one who at the outset objected to the jurisdiction, has preserved his rights by appropriate procedure and has no other remedy. Ex parte Rice, \n155 U.S. 396\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 149. If, however, the jurisdiction of the lower court is doubtful (In re Muir, \n254 U.S. 522\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed. --, decided by this court January 17, 1921), or if the jurisdiction depends upon a finding of fact made upon evidence which is not in the record (In re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 506\n, 509 S., 12 Sup. Ct. 453, or if the complaining party has an adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise (Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U. S. \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n 32, 37, 40 Sup. Ct. 239; Ex parte Harding, \n219 U.S. 363\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 324, 37 L. R. A. [N. S.] 392), the writ will ordinarily be denied. Tested by this rule, the case presented by the petition and the return does not entitle the Rock Island to this extraordinary remedy.\n The original bill filed against the Toledo Company in the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, alleged, among other things, that it had defaulted on an issue of $11,527,000 collateral trust gold bonds, secured by stock of the Chicago & Alton Railroad Company held by the Central Trust Company of New York, as trustee for the bondholders. These bonds were divided into two classes having somewhat different rights and interests. A single bondholders' committee was formed to protect both classes of bonds. Of the A bonds $6,480,000 were outstanding, and of these $ 5,248,000 were deposited with the committee,-$400,000 of them by the Rock Island. Of the B bonds $5,047,000 were outstanding, all of which were deposited with the committee by the Rock Island. The special master was directed to ascertain and report the amount, character, lien and priority of all claims, and creditors were notified to present before him their respective claims duly verified, or to file bills of intervention. The bondholders' committee then filed a petition, The bondholders' committee then filed a petition, collusive, and, in the alternative, that judgment be rendered for the committee in the amount of the face value of the bonds held by it, aggregating $10,295,000 and accrued interest. To that petition an answer in the nature of a cross-bill was filed by the plaintiff, who prayed that the committee's petition be held to be an intervention, that the receiver be directed to defend against the bonds held by the committee, and that these bonds be ordered surrendered if found to be invalid. By leave of court, the committee withdrew its petition, and sought its relief by a dependent bill. An order was thereupon entered, making the committee a party defendant to the original bill, with leave to answer and file a \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n cross-bill. This it did; and the Central Trust Company also filed a cross- bill to foreclose the lien on the Chicago & Alton stock held as security for the collateral trust bonds. An order was then made referring the case, on the issues raised by the several pleadings, to the special master to take testimony and report.\n At the beginning of the taking of testimony before the special master the appearances of counsel were formally noted by the master, among others, as follows:\n'Lawrence Maxwell, Esq., and J. P. Cotton, Esq., appearing for the bondholders' committee, Mr. Maxwell appearing to represent the interest of the Rock Island Company, and Mr. Cotton representing the A bonds.'\n\n Thereafter the Toledo Company filed an answer and cross-bill, in which it claimed, among other things, that the whole issue of the collateral trust bonds was void on account of fraud practiced by the Rock Island; that the Rock Island was liable for all amounts theretofore paid by the Toledo Company on the bonds in excess of dividends received on the Chicago & Alton stock; and that it was liable also for all amounts which the Toledo Company might be required to pay thereafter on account of any of the series A bonds which the court should hold to be valid obligations because they had passed into the hands of innocent holders. The cross-bill of the Toledo Company prayed that the necessary accounting be had, that the Rock Island be declared to be a party, that it be required to answer, and that in default of answer a decree be entered against it pro confesso. An order was entered in accordance with the prayer of the bill and notice thereof was served on Mr. Maxwell as its solicitor. His name had not appeared as counsel on any pleading filed by the committee.\n The Rock Island then filed a motion which stated:\n'Appearing solely for the purpose of the motion, and not intending to submit itself to the jurisdiction of this court \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n as a party to this suit, moves the court to set aside its finding in the order entered herein March 11, 1918, that the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company has heretofore entered its appearance as a party to this suit and its order, ... on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to make said order, or over the defendant as a party to the cross-bill.'\n\n This motion was overruled and an order was entered requiring answer within 20 days. Thereupon a further motion was made by the Rock Island, in which, renewing its claim that it had not entered its appearance, and asserting that the court was without jurisdiction over it as a defendant to the Toledo Company's cross-bill--\n'or at all, especially in respect of the pretended cause of action therein set forth for the recovery of moneys from it, moves to dismiss so much of said cross-bill as seeks to recover moneys from the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company upon the ground that it is not suable in this suit in this district upon said pretended cause of action, not being an inhabitant of the district or of the state of Ohio, and neither it nor the cross-complainant being a resident of the district or state.'\n\n This motion also was overruled, and thereupon this petition for a writ of prohibition or of mandamus was filed.\n The return of the District Court stated that the Toledo Company's answer had alleged that the Rock Island had intervened in its own right and had become a party to the cause, that at the hearing upon such answer evidence was introduced, and that service thereof was admitted by its solicitor as such. The return further recited:\n'The evidence upon which the court acted in making the findings and orders of which complaint is made in said petition is not set out in said petition. Respondent denies the statement in the brief for petitioner that 'the only basis for the claim that the District Court has \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the person of the Rock Island Company is that Mr. Maxwell entered its appearance by appearing as counsel for the bondholders' committee.' The original entry of appearance by Mr. Maxwell quoted in the petition and in the brief is only one item out of a large number of items of evidence considered by the court on this point.\n\n'No steps were taken by petitioner to preserve and have certified a record of the evidence submitted on the hearings of said motions, or to obtain a review of the orders complained of by appeal or error proceedings.'\n\n It is argued on these facts that the District Court did not acquire jurisdiction to enforce the personal liability of the Rock Island asserted in the cross-bill of the Toledo Company; but, applying the rule stated above, that question should not be decided in this proceeding. The most that can be said against the District Court's jurisdiction is that it is in doubt. And the return recites that the order which declared that the Rock Island became a party rests upon evidence which has not been embodied in the rocord. The immunity of the Rock Island from suit in the Northern District of Ohio, conferred by section 51 of the Judicial Code could be waived (In re Moore, \n209 U.S. 490\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 706, 14 Ann. Cas. 1164), and ordinarily a general appearance operates as a waiver ( Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 699). The District Court obviously had jurisdiction to determine, in the first instance, whether the Rock Island had entered a general appearance. Jones v. Andrews, 10 Wall. 327. It had jurisdiction also to determine whether the relief sought in the Toledo Company's cross-bill was in its nature germane to the proceedings theretofore instituted in the suit by the bondholders' committee or by the Central Trust Company, so that the rights asserted in the cross-bill could be properly litigated in that suit. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. Chicago Bank, \n134 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 550. And, finally, it had jurisdiction to determine whether the fact that such earlier proceeding had been \n\n[255 U.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n instituted on behalf of the Rock Island, that it had actively participated in the conduct thereof, and to that end had entered a general appearance, made it subject to further proceedings thereon by way of cross-bill, as fully as if the earlier action had been taken in its name as well as on its behalf. Compare, also, Ex parte Gordon, \n104 U.S. 515\n; Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., \n190 U.S. 540\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 754; In re Pollitz, \n206 U.S. 323\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 729. If in the judgment of the Rock Island the District Court erred in the decision of any one or all of these questions, it will have its remedy by appeal, unless it has failed to preserve by appropriate procedure that right of review. The same considerations lead to a denial also of the writ of mandamus. Ex parte Roe, \n234 U.S. 70\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 722\n\n\n Rule discharged, and petition dismissed.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFREDERICK v. FIDELITY MUT. LIFE INS. CO. OF PHILADELPHIA(1921)\nNo. 547\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Lowrie C. Barton, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. George Sutherland, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n John E. Schmidt having died pending bankruptcy, his trustee, the present petitioner, sued the insurance company, \n\n[256 U.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n respondent, in the court of common pleas of Allegheny county, Pa., to recover the proceeds of a certain policy of life insurance, with interest from the date of death. By an amended statement plaintiff limited his claim to the surrender value of the policy at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy. The court of common pleas gave judgment in favor of defendant; on appeal the Superior Court affirmed the judgment (75 Pa. Super. Ct. 77); the Supreme Court of the state refused an appeal, thereby making the judgment of the Superior Court final; and a writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n The facts in brief are as follows: September 20, 1902, the insurance company issued a policy of insurance upon the life of John E. Schmidt in the sum of $1,000, payable upon surrender of the policy properly receipted, after acceptance of proof of death; payment to be made to his wife, Annie M. Schmidt, or, if he should survive her, then to his administrators, executors or assigns, subject to certain provisions, one of which was:\n'The insured, with the written approval of the president or vice president, may upon the surrender of this policy, change the beneficiary, or with such approval it may be assigned.'\n\n December 19, 1912, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against Schmidt; on January 8th following he was duly adjudged a bankrupt; and one month later petitioner was elected and duly qualified as his trustee. The policy was not included in the schedule of assets, and petitioner had no knowledge of it until after the proceeds had been paid by the insurance company to the widow. Upon the date of the adjudication of bankruptcy the policy had a cash surrender value of $322. April 4, 1913, the bankrupt died, proof of the fact and cause of his death was duly made and accepted by the company, and May 7, 1913, it paid the face of the policy to the beneficiary named therein and took her receipt therefor. Neither \n\n[256 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n then nor at any time before had the company knowledge of the adjudication in bankruptcy, or notice that the trustee would claim the whole or any part of the policy.\n The trustee's suit to recover the surrender value is grounded upon section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541; 30 Stat. 544, 565 [Comp. St.  9654]), under which the trustee is vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt as of the date he was adjudged a bankrupt, to rights and property not exempt, including:\n'(3) Powers which he might have exercised for his own benefit, but not those which he might have exercised for some other person; ... ( 5) property which prior to the filing of the petition he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him: Provided, that when any bankrupt shall have any insurance policy which has a cash surrender value payable to himself, his estate, or personal representatives, he may, within thirty days after the cash surrender value has been ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the same, pay or secure to the trustee the sum so ascertained and stated, and continue to hold, own, and carry such policy free from the claims of the creditors participating in the distribution of his estate under the bankruptcy proceedings, otherwise the policy shall pass to the trustee as assets. ...'\n\n This provision shows it was the purpose of Congress to pass to the trustee whatever sum was available to the bankrupt at the time of bankruptcy as cash assets to be realized on surrender of the policy, but otherwise to leave to the insured the benefit of his life insurance. Burlingham v. Crouse, \n228 \nU.S. 459, 473\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 564, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 148; Everett v. Judson, \n228 U.S. 474\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 568, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 154. In two recent cases, Cohen v. Samuels, \n245 \nU.S. 50, 53\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 36, and Cohn v. Malone, \n248 U.S. 450\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 141, we have held that the surrender value of a policy not in terms payable to the bankrupt, but which could be made so payable at the bankrupt's will by a simple declaration changing the \n\n[256 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n beneficiary must be regarded as assets to which the trustee in bankruptcy was entitled. In each case the question arose while the policy was in the bankrupt's possession unmatured, and the interest of the insurance company was not affected. Here the question is whether, after the death of the insured and payment of the stipulated amount to the beneficiary named in the policy in strict conformity to its terms, without notice of the bankruptcy, or claim made by the trustee, there is a liability on the part of the insurance company to pay to the trustee the surrender value that, on complying with the terms of the policy, he might have demanded.\n It is not enough to sustain the trustee's claim to say that the filing of the petition in bankruptcy was a caveat to all the world, and in effect an attachment and injunction, and that on adjudication title to the bankrupt's property became vested in the trustee. Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 269. The asserted right of property arose out of a contract under which the insurance company had rights as well as the insured. The company's contract was to pay the stipulated amount to the beneficiary first named on receiving proof of death of the insured, unless the latter should have surrendered the policy and, with the written approval of the head officer of the company, have changed the beneficiary. The requirement of such surrender and approval was for the protection of the company, so purposed that at least it should have notice before its liability under the policy was modified. Section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act cannot be construed to give to the trustee in bankruptcy a right as against the company to demand that the surrender value be made assets of the estate, as by a change in beneficiary, without timely notice to the company of a demand for such a change; for the section in its very words contemplates that the cash surrender value shall have been 'ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the policy.' \n\n[256 U.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, the company, having in good faith performed the contract according to its terms, without the notice that the contract called for as a condition of changing the terms, cannot be called upon to make the further payment demanded by the trustee.

St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830]), as interpreted in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 376. Frey & Son, Incorporated, instituted this action in the District Court of the United States for Maryland to recover threefold damages. Under an elaborate charge the issues were submitted to the jury for determination. Judgment for \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n $2,139 entered (June 22, 1917) upon a verdict for plaintiff was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals July 16, 1919 (Cudahy Packing Co. v. Frey & Son, 261 Fed. 65, 171 C. C. A. 661), after decision of United States v. Colgate & Co. (June 2, 1919), \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443, and before United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 U.S. 85\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 251. Plaintiff in error reserved its right of review here, waived a new trial and consented to entry of final judgment for the Packing Company. Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322.\n The court below concluded 'there was no formal written or oral agreement with jobbers for the maintenance of prices,' and that, considering the doctrine approved in United States v. Colgate & Co., the District Court should have directed a verdict for the defendant. Other errors by the trial court were assigned and relied upon. If any of them was well taken, we must affirm the final judgment, entered after waiver of new trial and upon consent, as above shown.\n It is unnecessary to repeat what we said in United States v. Colgate & Co. and United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc. Apparently the former case was misapprehended. The latter opinion distinctly stated that the essential agreement, combination or conspiracy might be implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances. Having regard to the course of dealing and all the pertinent facts disclosed by the present record, we think whether there existed an unlawful combination or agreement between the manufacturer and jobbers was a question for the jury to decide, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it held otherwise.\n Among other things the trial court charged:\n'I can only say to you that if you shall find that the defendant indicated a sales plan to the wholesalers and jobbers, which plan fixed the price below which the wholesalers and jobbers were not to sell to retailers, and you find defendant called this particular feature of this plan \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n to their attention on very many different occasions, and you find the great majority of them not only expressing no dissent from such plan, but actually co-operating in carrying it out by themselves selling at the prices named, you may reasonably find from such fact that there was an agreement or combination forbidden by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.'\n\n The recited facts, standing alone (there were other pregnant ones), did not suffice to establish an agreement or combination forbidden by the Sherman Act. This we pointed out in United States v. Colgate & Co. As given the instruction was erroneous and material.\n The judgment below must be\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court. The action was brought by plaintiff in error, in part to recover threefold damages under section 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890 (chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209, 210 [Comp. St.  8829]), because of injuries sustained in its business by reason of an alleged combination or agreement for the maintenance of prices made between the Packing Company and various wholesalers and jobbers in its product known as 'Old Dutch Cleanser.' The declaration contained a second count, based upon alleged discrimination in violation of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914 ( chapter 323,  2, 4, 38 Stat. 730, 731 [Comp. St.  8835b, 8835d]); but this calls for no special notice. A judgment rendered by the United States District Court upon the verdict of a jury in favor of plaintiff was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (Cudahy Packing Co. v. Frey & Son, 261 Fed. 65, 171 C. C. A. 661), upon the ground that the acts of defendant and its associates amounted to no more than an announcement in advance that customers were expected \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n to charge prices fixed by defendant upon penalty of refusal to sell to an offending customer, observance of the request by customers generally, and actual enforcement of the penalty by refusing to sell to such customers as failed to maintain the price; and hence that under the decision of this court in United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443, there was no ground of recovery under the Anti-Trust Act.\n I agree with the court that the Circuit Court of Appeals misapprehended the effect of our decision in the case cited, and that under rules laid down in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373, 399\n, 400 S., 408, 31 Sup. Ct. 376, and United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 \nU.S. 85, 99\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 251, the trial judge was right in submitting the case to the jury.\n Notwithstanding its conclusion that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that a verdict ought to have been directed in favor of defendant, the majority holds that the judgment under review here ought to be affirmed, because of supposed error in an instruction given to the jury (a new trial having been waived by plaintiff on consenting to entry of final judgment for the Packing Company by the Circuit Court of Appeals under the practice followed in Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66, 83\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322).\n The instruction to which error is attributed related to the question whether a combination between defendant and the wholesalers and jobbers for the purpose of maintaining resale prices had in fact been shown. After referring to the method pursued by defendant in marketing 'Old Dutch Cleanser,' and stating that under the law defendant could not be held liable under the first count unless it was a party to a contract or combination or conspiracy to fix and maintain prices; that defendant denied it was a party to any such combination, contract, or conspiracy, and insisted it had merely notified the jobbing trade what prices it thought were the lowest at which jobbers would resell its product at sufficient return \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n to make it worth their while to push the sale of such product; that plaintiff admitted that, with reference to most of the jobbers at least, there was no written and signed agreement on the subject, and none couched in any formal or express terms; but that defendant from time to time had issued circulars to the trade urging the importance of maintaining 'uniform and fair jobbing and retail prices and trading provisions' and stating that 'any sales by jobbers at special prices would ... demoralize prices and disturb the entire business in these products,' and that 'uniformity and equality as to terms, delivery and price is essential. It is therefore required of our distributing agents that they fully co- operate with us in this direction, as per terms, conditions, and prices laid down in our published General Sales List,' and that upon bills sent to wholesalers by defendant there was stamped a notice that 'All your quotations, bids, sales and invoices for Old Dutch Cleanser either to jobbers, semijobbers, retailers or consumers, should be at a rate not lower than laid down in our published General Sales List'-the trial judge proceeded, as to the particular question whether in fact there was a combination, to speak thus:\n'I can only say to you that if you shall find that the defendant indicated a sales plan to the wholesalers and jobbers, which plan fixed the price below which the wholesalers and jobbers were not to sell to retailers, and you find defendant called this particular feature of the plan to their attention on very many different occasions, and you find the great majority of them not only expressing no dissent from such plan, but actually co-operating in carrying it out by themselves selling at the prices named, you may reasonably find from such fact that there was an agreement or combination forbidden by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.'\n\n Passing for the moment the question whether this was legally erroneous, I am unable to find in the record any \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n basis for attributing error to the trial judge in respect to it, because it was not made the subject of any proper exception. The trial was litigiously contested, defendant having taken no less than 157 exceptions, of which 20 were directed to the charge given to the jury. Among them, however, I can find none that challenges the proposition embodied in the instruction now held to be erroneous, recites either the words or the substance of that instruction, or otherwise fairly identifies it so as to bring it to the attention of the trial judge. Defendant relies upon an exception which reads as follows:\n'I also respectfully except to so much of your honor's charge as indicates that an unlawful contract and combination or conspiracy or understanding is shown where it appears that in the absence of an express obligation some dealer, responding to a suggestion from Cudahy Packing Company, may have sold at the prices mentioned in its literature.'\n\n To which the judge responded:\n'All a question of fact for the jury. All I can say on such questions is that the jury, when they come into this jury box, I do not suppose, leave their common sense behind.'\n\n There is nothing here to show that the attention of the trial judge either was or ought to have been directed to that part of his charge now held to be erroneous. The exception alleged did not even faintly or approximately express the tenor and effect of that instruction or of any other that was given to the jury; much less did it fairly and distinctly raise a question of law upon this or any other point in the charge.\n It is elementary that, in order to lay foundation to review by writ of error the proceedings of the courts of the United States in the trial of common-law actions, the questions of law proposed to be reviewed must be raised by specific, precise, direct, and unambiguous objections, so taken as clearly to afford to the trial judge an opportunity for revising his rulings; and that a bill of exceptions not \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 215]\n\u00a0\n fulfilling this test will furnish no support for an assignment of error. To quote from some of the decisions:\n'One object of an exception is to call the attention of the Circuit Judge to the precise point as to which it is supposed he has erred, that he may then and there consider it, and give new and different instructions to the jury, if in his judgment it would be proper to do so.' Beaver v. Taylor, \n93 U.S. 46\n, 55 (23 L. Ed. 797).\n\n'While it is the duty of this court to review the action of subordinate courts, justice to those courts requires that their alleged errors should be called directly to their attention, and that their action should not be reversed upon questions which the astuteness of counsel in this court has evolved from the record. It is not the province of this court to retry these cases de novo.' Robinson & Co. v. Belt, \n187 \nU.S. 41, 50\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 16, 19 (47 L. Ed. 65).\n\n'It has been too frequently held to require the extended citation of cases that an exception of this general character will not cover specific objections, which in fairness to the court ought to have been called to its attention, in order that if necessary, it could correct or modify them. ... In such cases it is the duty of the objecting party to point out specifically the part of the instructions regarded as erroneous.' McDermott v. Severe, \n202 \nU.S. 600, 610\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 709, 713 (50 L. Ed. 1162).\n\n'The primary and essential function of an exception is to direct the mind of the trial judge to a single and precise point in which it is supposed that he has erred in law so that he may reconsider it and change his ruling if convinced of error, and that injustice and mistrials due to inadvertent errors may thus be obviated. An exception, therefore, furnishes no basis for reversal upon any ground other than the one specifically called to the attention of the trial court.' United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 529\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 298, 303 (59 L. Ed. 696).\n\n See, also, Guerini Stone Co. v. Carlin Construction Co., \n248 \nU.S. 334, 348\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 102; Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76, 82\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 435.\n Not only the trial judge, but the opposing party has \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 216]\n\u00a0\n rights that one who objects to the course of the proceedings is bound to respect, if he seeks a review by writ of error. To permit the result of a trial to be set at naught because of an objection that has no proper relation to any ruling made unless it be taken in a sense entirely variant from the language expressed by objecting counsel, would render the fair and orderly conduct of a trial impossible and place a premium upon ambiguity and even trickery. Upon the present record, it would be most unjust to the plaintiff, as well as to the trial judge, to call upon the latter, wearied as he must have been in the course of such a trial, to recognize in the one hundred and fifty-fourth objection a challenge of the legal accuracy of an instruction that he had expressed in language so very different.\n But, were the instruction duly excepted to, I am unable to assent to the view that it was erroneous. The jury were not told that from the facts recited, if believed, an agreement or combination forbidden by the act of Congress necessarily resulted, but only that from those facts, together with other and undisputed facts that were in evidence, they reasonably might find there was such an agreement or combination. It is settled beyond controversy that an agreement in order to be a violation of the act need not be expressed, but may be 'implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances.' United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 \nU.S. 85, 99\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 251, 253 (64 L. Ed. 471). And, while naturally it influences the action of the participants, it of course need not be such as to control them in a legal sense. From the very fact that it is a violation of the law it cannot be legally binding; and it is only as a de facto agreement, or understanding, or combination that the conspiracy in restraint of trade need control the conduct of the participants in order that it may constitute a violation of the act.\n Reading the criticized instruction in the light of the other parts of the charge, it amounted to no more than \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 217]\n\u00a0\n telling the jury that if defendant had a sales plan that, if assented to and carried into effect, would constitute a fixing of prices in restraint of interstate trade and commerce, and the particulars of this plan were repeatedly communicated by defendant to the many wholesalers and jobbers with whom it had relations, and if the great majority of them not only did not express dissent from the plan but actually co-operated in carrying it out by themselves adhering to its details; the jury reasonably might infer that they did mutually give assent to the plan, equivalent to an agreement or combination to pursue it. In short, that upon finding many persons, actuated by a common motive, exchanging communications between themselves respecting a plan of conduct and acting in concert in precise accordance with the plan, the jury might find that they had agreed or combined to act as in fact they did act; that their simultaneous pursuit of an identical programme was not a miraculous coincidence, but was the result of an agreement or combination to act together for a common end.\n The opinion states no ground upon which the instruction is held to be erroneous; the elaborate brief submitted in behalf of the Packing Company specifies no criticism upon it; and I am unable to discern adequate reason for condemning it. It suggested a perfectly natural and legitimate inference that might be drawn by the jury from the facts in evidence; having included in the recital the very same facts and circumstances, indeed, upon which this court now unanimously holds that the case was for the jury. Concerted action is of the essence of a conspiracy (Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 542), and it is 'hornbook law' that, where concerted action is found to exist following an interchange of communication between the actors, it gives ground for a reasonable inference of an agreement to act in concert. Just as the mechanism of a watch affords evidence of a design, and \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 218]\n\u00a0\n hence of a designer; so a systematic course of action, pursued at one and the same time by many persons and affecting their mutual interests, raises a fair inference of an agreement between them to pursue that course of action. Juries in conspiracy cases are instructed to this effect every day, without disapproval; and it seems to me the permitted inference is in accord with common sense and the ordinary rules by which men's motives and secret understandings are judged from their acts.\n I find nothing in the Colgate & Co. decision to support a criticism of the judge's instruction. There the indictment, under the interpretation adopted by the trial court and necessarily accepted by us, failed to charge the making of any agreement, either express or implied, that imported an obligation to observe specified resale prices. This was the very ground of our decision, as was pointed out in the case of Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 U.S. 99\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 251. Here the state of the evidence, as this entire court now holds, required the trial court to submit to the jury the question of fact whether an agreement to observe the specified resale prices was to be inferred from the course of dealing and other circumstances. The trial judge fairly summarized the pertinent facts and circumstances disclosed by the record regarding the course of dealing between the parties, from which the alleged agreement, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade might or might not be inferred, and then, in the clause now criticized, submitted to the jury the question of fact whether one should be inferred. I am unable to see in what respect he failed to conform to correct practice and the decisions of this court; or how, if his instruction was erroneous, a trial judge can correctly submit to a jury the question whether, from a course of dealing and other circumstances, an agreement to fix prices in restraint of trade shall be found.\n The circumstances from which the trial judge permitted an inference of conspiracy to be drawn seem to me stronger \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 219]\n\u00a0\n than those held sufficient by this court in Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66, 84\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 353, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322, where there was no direct proof of the terms of any conference or agreement participated in by the defendants, and the principal evidence consisted of circulars issued and a concerted course of dealing under which certain steamship owners operated their vessels in the trade from New York to South African ports without competing with one another; upon the strength of which the court rejected the suggestion that the circulars and the concerted course of dealing under them were accidental and without premeditation followed by unity in execution. So in Eastern States Lumber Assoc. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 607-609, 612, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788, there was no express agreement among the retailers to refrain from dealing with the listed wholesalers, nor any penalty for failing to do so. But the court found, in the systematic and periodical circulation of certain confidential information, commonly called black lists, intended to guide the action of the recipients and cause them to withhold patronage from the listed concerns, sufficient evidence of a conspiracy in restraint of trade, saying (\n234 U.S. 612\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 954, L. R. A. 1915A, 788):\n'It is said that in order to show a combination or conspiracy within the Sherman Act some agreement must be shown under which the concerted action is taken. It is elementary, however, that conspiracies are seldom capable of proof by direct testimony and may be inferred from the things actually done, and when in this case by concerted action the names of wholesalers who were reported as having made sales to consumers were periodically reported to the other members of the associations, the conspiracy to accomplish that which was the natural consequence of such action may be readily inferred.'\n\n Here the character of the communications was different; but as evidence, when taken in connection with the concerted action that followed, they have the same tendency to show a conspiracy. \n\n[256 U.S. 208, 220]\n\u00a0\n Authorities easily might be multiplied, but it is unnecessary. Convinced that the ruling now made, if adhered to, will seriously hamper the courts of the United States in carrying into effect the prohibition of Congress against combinations in restraint of interstate trade, I respectfully dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRIEDMAN v. U S(1921)\nNo. 221\nArgued: March 14, 1921Decided: March 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles A. Keigwin and William R. Andrews, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action to recover the sum of $3,600, excessive payment exacted by the Secretary of the Interior for 120 acres of coal land, which plaintiff (we so designate him in this opinion) was entitled to enter and did enter under section 2347 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4659).\n The Court of Claims dismissed the petition and from its judgment this appeal is prosecuted.\n The right of plaintiff to enter the land is not disputed. The dispute is as to the price prescribed by section 2347. Its provision is that payment shall be made of not less than $10 per acre if the lands selected be more than 15 miles \n\n[255 U.S. 468, 469]\n\u00a0\n from a completed railroad, and not less than $20 per acre if they be within 15 miles of the railroad.\n The entry of plaintiff was within 15 miles of the railroad and the Secretary required the payment of $50 per acre. The requirement is attacked as beyond the power of the Secretary, it being in excess of the statutory price which, it is contended, is $20 per acre; and to sustain the attack there is adduced the prior practice of the Interior Department and cases whose analogy, it is contended, demonstrate that the words 'not less than twenty dollars per acre' mean not more than $20 per acre. The answer to the contention would seem necessarily to be that 'less' and 'more' are words of contrast-indeed of opposition, and cannot be confounded. It is easy to see that if their difference should be disregarded in dealing with the things of the world, sensible or insensible, the resulting confusion would be hard to describe.\n Plaintiff makes the words even more facile to management than in the above contention, and makes them exclude all freedom of judgment and choice of price, which they seem not only to imply but require, in the administration of section 2347. In support of the liberty of identifying or confusing different things plaintiff invokes the practice of the Interior Department from 1873 to 1907 and urges that Congress by silence gave sanction and approval to the practice.\n The inference deduced from the practice and the asserted sanction we cannot accept. The practice was but the exercise of administration by the Department upon the then circumstances, deemed proper and adequate then and accepted as such by Congress.\n In 1907 there was a change of conditions and they dictated a change in administration and in aid of a judgment of values and its exercise under the direction of section 2347, coal lands were subjected to classification and appraisement, a procedure not arbitrary but safe and sensible, establishing \n\n[255 U.S. 468, 470]\n\u00a0\n a proportional relation between the payment made and the value of the lands received. And this is consonant to the statute; indeed, is its direction, if its words be considered. There has been no protesting objection from Congress, and the Executive and Legislative Departments have been in accord for 14 years. The present practice of the Interior Department therefore has the same confimation that plaintiff asserts for its prior practice.\n Plaintiff, however, contends that section 2347 is the successor of prior legislation and that by such legislation, and decisions under it, the words 'not less than' of that section have been made the equivalent 'of the minimum and minimum price' of prior legislation and that $20 per acre is the 'sole price fixed by law' for lands within 15 miles of a completed railroad.\n The legislation referred to is an Act of July 1, 1864 (13 Stat. 343), an Act of March 3, 1865 (13 Stat. 529), and an Act of March 3, 1873 (17 Stat. 607). The latter statute becoming section 2347 and other sections.\n The first act provided for the sale of coal lands at public auction 'at a minimum price of $20 per acre,' and 'that any lands not thus disposed of' should 'thereafter be liable to private entry at said minimum.' The second act provided that coal land could be entered by a citizen actually engaged in mining upon it 'at the minimum of $20 per acre fixed in the Town and Property Act of July 1, 1864.' The third act omits provision for offering coal lands at auction and subjects them to private entry at not less than $10 or $20 an acre, according to distance from a completed railroad. This provision became section 2347\n\n\n These acts were the successors of one another in general policy but not in details. In the latter they differed in provision and progressed to the explicit declarations of section 2347 and their inevitable meaning. And there is nothing to the contrary in Colorado C. Co. v. United \n\n[255 U.S. 468, 471]\n\u00a0\n States, \n123 \nU.S. 307, 325\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 131. The case, indeed, was concerned with other provisions than those involved here.\n We need not go beyond this general exposition. It would extend this opinion to a repellant length to trace and comment upon the details and refinements of plaintiff's reasoning, and upon the analogies he urges of the price of lands under the preemption and other laws.\n We are not impressed with the contention that if the price of $20 an acre is not the fixed and ultimate price there is no test or price and that the Secretary of the Interior 'may charge what price he chooses, ... no law putting any restraint upon his action,' and that the 'sale of coal lands may be stopped altogether if, for any reason, the Secretary considers that to be judicious or desirable.' This is tantamount to saying that the Secretary may abuse his trust and the power conferred upon him to execute it. There is no argument against conferring power or denying power in the assertion that it may be abused. The world acts and must act upon a different consideration. Government would otherwise be impossible. Besides, there is no contention that there is an arbitrary abuse of power in the present case, and when such abuse shall occur a remedy may be of concern and no doubt will be found.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nG S WILLARD CO. v.

VALLELY(1921)\nNo. 234\nArgued: March 18, 1921Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fred B. Dodge, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Francis J. Murphy, of Minot, N. D., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirming an order of the District Judge for the District of North Dakota in a bankruptcy proceeding. The pertinent facts are: On August 15, 1917, one Conrad C. Reiswing executed a trust deed for the benefit of his creditors to John P. Galbraith, assignee and the petitioner herein. The assigned stock of merchandise was sold. Various proceedings and meetings of creditors were had, not necessary to recite. On December 22, 1917, upon the petition of creditors Reiswig was duly adjudged a bankrupt, and Valley, respondent herein, is his trustee in bankruptcy. Galbraith appeared in the bankruptcy proceedings and filed an account, claiming therein the right to retain a certain sum for fees and disbursements under the assignment, and piad over to the trustee in bankruptcy the other moneys which he had acquired. Thereupon the trustee in bankruptcy filed a petition with the referee in bankruptcy asking, in a summary proceeding. for an order upon Galbraith to show cause why he should not pay over the sum of $1,474.10, retained as fees and expenses \n\n[256 U.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n as trustee under the assignment. The referee in bankruptcy made an order that Galbraith forthwith pay over that sum to the trustee in bankruptcy or show cause why he should not do so. Galbraith appeared and set up that the order of the referee in the summary proceeding was without authority as he was an adverse claimant to the moneys referred to in the order, and that the court had no jurisdiction in a summary proceeding to hear and determine the questions involved. Without waiving objection, and subject to the right of Galbraith to assert his objection to the proceedings, testimony was taken concerning the money expended and retained by the assignee prior to the bankruptcy proceedings, for administering the estate. Among other things it was stipulated that as to the particular money expended by the assignee, he was an adverse claimant. The referee delivered an opinion passing upon the amount of expenditures and compensation, but held that Galbraith was an adverse claimant within the rule declared by this court in Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 U.S. 18\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 293, and that, therefore, the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to proceed in a summary manner, and discharged the order. The decision of the referee was reversed by the District Judge. 253 Fed. 390. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court, 261 Fed. 670, and the case is here upon writ of certiorari.\n We think the referee was right in holding that the case was governed by Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, supra. In that case a general assignment for the benefit of creditors was made within four months of the bankruptcy proceeding, the assignment was therefore an act of bankruptcy. A receiver was appointed in the bankruptcy court. The assignee turned over the proceeds of sale of the property, retaining his fees as assignee and his disbursements to counsel. A summary proceeding was begun in the District Court ordering the assignee to show cause \n\n[256 U.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n why he should not pay to the receiver the amounts retained. This order was made against the objection of the assignee that the court had no authority to proceed in that manner. This court held that the assignee was an adverse claimant as to these amounts, and that the District Court was without jurisdiction to determine the controversy in a summary proceeding. This case has been repeatedly cited as determinative of the law and practice in similar cases. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals made no reference to the Comingor Case and held the case was ruled by Randolph v. Scruggs, \n190 U.S. 533\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 710; but that case did not present the question here involved. In that case there had been an assignment prior to the bankruptcy proceedings, and the question presented was whether a claim for professional services rendered in the course of a general assignment before the bankruptcy was entitled to be paid as a preferential claim out of the estate in the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy when the adjudication of bankruptcy had been made within four months after the making of the assignment, and the assignment set aside as in contrvention of the bankruptcy law. It was held that the claim for compensation could be allowed so far as the services were shown to be beneficial to the estate.\n In Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 U.S. 102\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969, also cited in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, it was held that books and records of a corporation, upon adjudication in bankruptcy, passed to the trustee, and belonged in the custody of the bankruptcy court, there being no adverse claim to them. Upon that state of facts it was \n\n[256 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n held that, on a rule to show cause the court could properly make an order compelling the delivery of the books to the trustee. In the opinion in that case, Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, supra, and other cases are cited for the purpose of showing that a different rule would prevail when an adverse claimant set up a right to be heard in other than a summary proceeding.\n It may be, as suggested by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that a summary proceeding at the instance of the trustee would afford a more speedy and economical administration of the estate in bankruptcy. But the right to recover in such instances, only in suits of the ordinary character, with the rights and remedies incident thereto, has been consistently maintained by this court. The principle of the Comingor Case has never been departed from in this court. It establishes the right of an assignee for the benefit of creditors, to the extent that he asserts rights to expenses incurred and compensation earned under an assignment in good faith before the bankruptcy proceedings, to have the merits of his claim determined in a judicial proceeding suitable to that purpose, and not by summary proceedings where punishment for contempt is the means of enforcing the order. We see no occasion to depart from this practice. There was no waiver by the assignee of his rights in this respect. He made no attempt to retain the body of the estate as against the trustee in bankruptcy. As to his disbursements and compensation while acting as assignee, he asserted an adverse claim. Under the settled rule of this court he could not be proceeded against summarily for such disbursements and compensation over his protest duly made against that method of procedure.\n In our view the courts below erred in deciding otherwise, and the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See full consideration of the subject by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, Judges Sanborn, Van Devanter, and Reed, in In re Rathman, 183 Fed. 913, 106 C.

It turns upon the relation of Samuel Garland and his right to compensation as one of the delegation of the Choctaw Nation to procure for the Nation a recognition and payment of money due from the United States in settlement of or in payment for lands east of the Mississippi river ceded to the United States under certain treaties.\n The case as made by the petition is this: Samuel Garland was a member of the Choctaw Tribe of Indians, and in 1853 he, with four others, were created a delegation and authorized to settle all unsettled business between the Choctaw Nation and the United States. In \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n 1855 the Chiefs of the Nation agreed to pay the delegation, naming them, 20 per cent. upon all the claims arising to the Nation or individuals for their services in negotiating the treaty and for other services which were to be rendered thereafter in Washington.\n In pursuance of this authority they entered into negotiations with the United States for settlement of the controversies concerning what, if anything, was due on account of matters growing out of certain treaties ( they are set out in the petition) and for the payment for lands ceded to the United States by the Choctaws.\n The result was the direction by an Act of Congress (1888; 25 Stat. 239) of the payment to the Choctaw Nation of the sum of $2,858,798.62 in satisfaction of a judgment of the Court of Claims in favor of the Nation.\n On February 25, 1888, the Nation, on account of the death of Samuel Garland, and for the purpose of paying his estate and the other members of the delegation, appointed Campbell Le Flore and Edmund McCurtain agents of the Nation to make requisition upon the United States for the amount due Garland and the other delegates for the services rendered the Nation, and for moneys expended by them. Twenty per cent. of the amount appropriated by Congress to pay the judgment of the Court of Claims was the amount fixed to be paid.\n The appointment of Le Flore and McCurtain was without the consent of Garland's estate or the consent of his heirs.\n Le Flore and McCurtain collected from the United States $638,919.43, the same being 20 per cent. of the judgment of the Court of Claims, and were charged with the duty of distributing the same equally.\n In 1889 they paid to the heirs of Garland $43,943.20, but refused to pay the balance due, amounting to $115,786.65.\n The Nation has never denied the indebtedness to the \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n estate of Garland, but recognized it by an act passed by its General Council in 1897, and authorized its payment by warrants issued by the national auditor.\n The act was vetoed, for the reason that it would exhaust the available funds in the treasury of the Nation and force the closing of the Choctaw schools. The estate, having no power to sue the Nation, could not do so until authorized by an act of Congress.\n The petition sets forth the respective interests of the heirs of Garland.\n The Court of Claims found some of these facts, but found other facts, and concluded from them that the contract of the Nation was with the delegates as a body, and that the Nation was not responsible for any failure on the part of Le Flore to pay the estate of Garland all that was due Garland. In other words, the court held that Le Flore and McCurtain were not the \"agents' of the Choctaw Nation for whose misapplication of the fund, if they did misapply it, the Nation was liable,' but that they were, when dealt with, 'the delegation, the successors of the original delegation, standing in such relation to the Nation and to other members of the delegation or their beneficiaries that the payment made to them, as it was made, is to be held an acquittance of the Nation.'\n The conception of the opinion is that the delegation was a unit, constituted such, and intended to act as such, the survivors or even the survivor of those appointed succeeding to the powers and rights of deceased delegates; that the Nation so regarded and so dealt with them; and that, therefore, Le Flore and McCurtain succeeded to the rights of the delegation, could receive the powers conferred upon them by the enactment of February 25, 1888, and could accept any sums that came to them under that enactment 'as a complete payment and a final discharge of all debts and obligations of the Choctaw Nation to' the delegation under the contract of 1853. \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n This being the conception of the court, its final conclusion was that the payment made to Le Flore and McCurtain served to discharge the Nation from any further liability to the delegation, or any member thereof, or their representatives, and on that ground it ordered the case to be dismissed.\n As we have seen, there was a delegation constituted, and Garland was a member of it, and its compensation was agreed to be '20 per cent. upon all claims arising or accruing to' the 'Nation or individuals under the treaty of June 22, 1855, for their services in negotiating said treaty and for other services which are to be rendered hereafter at Washington.' It will be observed there was no disposition of the amount that might be received, nor distribution of it, nor of the services that might be required to be performed, nor designation of who was to receive or control it.\n Delegates, however, died, and others were appointed in like generality, and finally there was a concentration in Le Flore and McCurtain, and, the National Council reciting that the delegates preceding Le Flore and McCurtain had recovered from the United States $2,858,798.62, and that the delegates were entitled to 20 per cent. of the amount, that percentage was appropriated out of the fund and directed to be paid to Le Flore and McCurtain as delegates and successors of the delegates of 1853, 'to enable them [Le Flore and McCurtain] to pay the expenses and discharge the obligation in the prosecution of said claim [the claim of the Nation against the United States], and to settle with the respective distributees of said delegation.'\n There was also an appropriation for other sums due the delegation, and it was enacted that all of the sums should be paid to Le Flore and McCurtain, describing them as successors to the other delegates, and when so paid to be accepted 'as a complete payment and a final \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n discharge of all debts and obligations of the Choctaw Nation to said delegation' under the contract of their appointment; and it was enacted that the amounts provided to be paid should 'be accepted as full and final settlement of the amount due under their respective contracts,' and the remainder of the amount appropriated by Congress should be retained in the treasury of the United States, subject to the legislation and requisition of the Nation.\n In 1873, however, there was a recognition of liability to the delegates, and it was provided that the national treasurer be authorized to receive the appropriation and to pay (among other obligations) '20 per cent. of such appropriation for the delegates of 1853 and 1854, to enable them to discharge all liabilities and obligations under said contracts [ there were other contracts than that with the delegates] and all expenses necessarily incurred in recovering said claim.' It was provided that all just debts due the Nation from the delegation should first be deducted.\n The enactment of 1888 was a deputation to Le Flore and McCurtain to collect and disburse the congressional appropriation, and they became for that purpose the agents of the Nation, not the agents of the delegation, and it was the first deputation of that power. By a prior enactment the payments made to the delegation were from the national treasury, and another (1867) provided for such payment. In other words, until the enactment of February 25, 1888, the control of the appropriation was in the Nation and payments out of it by the Nation.\n Our conclusion, therefore, from the record, is not that of the Court of Claims. There was implication, at least, of liability to the delegates individually; and this was the understanding of the delegates. Le Flore so understood it, and the payment made to Garland's estate was a recognition of it. The payment is distinctly in opposition \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n to the contention of the government and the conclusion of the Court of Claims. Both the contention and conclusion assert a unity in the delegation, the rejection of any individual payment or reward to the delegates, a time limit upon compensation for their services, however great or effective, a kind of jus accrescendi in the successors of deceased delegates. If such right existed at all, it would have existed, even though the succession had come a moment before the congressional appropriation was made, and no services whatever rendered by the successors of deceased delegates.\n And these views must have impressed Congress, and induced its enactment authorizing suit against the Choctaw Nation; not, it is true, upon the contract, because other services than Garland's were rendered in procurement of the appropriation and should be considered, and Congress therefore required the judgment in the suit 'to be rendered on the principle of quantum meruit' for what Garland did and expended.\n It is objected, however, that the suit was not asserted or prosecuted on that basis, and that there is no description of the services of Garland or their value, and therefore no elements for a judgment established, such as the statute authorized. It authorized, the explicit contention is, a judgment on a quantum meruit, and that therefore 'no judgment can be rendered on a petition which seeks to recover merely upon the ground of a contract.'\n The contention under the facts disclosed in the petition is technical. The petition showed services rendered, and, if the petition be true, valuable services-and for them there should have been recovery, if the Nation was liable, and we think it was. How much we do not say, nor did the Court of Claims consider; it being of opinion that the Nation was not liable for anything. Upon the return of the case it may determine the amount due Garland, if \n\n[256 U.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n anything, dependent upon what his services contributed in securing the congressional appropriation.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims must therefore be reversed; and it is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEDDES v. ANACONDA COPPER MINING CO.(1921)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 590, 591]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas J. Walsh and C. B. Nolan, both of Helena, Mont., for appellants.\n Messrs. W. B. Rodgers, of Butte, Mont., and L. O. Evans, of Butte, Mont., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n With formalities, which are not assailed, a special meeting of the stockholders of the Alice Gold & Silver Mining Company, by resolution, ratified a contract in writing theretofore authorized by the board of directors and executed by the officers of the company for the sale to the Anaconda Copper Mining Company of all the property, of every kind, of the Alice Company. The officers were authorized and directed to execute such deeds and assignments as should be necessary to complete the sale, and a deed in form conveying all of the Alice property to the Anaconda Company was executed and delivered by \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n them on May 31, 1910. The consideration, 30,000 shares of the capital stock of the Anaconda Company, was paid, and the purchaser took possession of the property.\n Almost a year later, on April 15, 1911, at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Alice Company a resolution was adopted, by the vote of more than two-thirds of the issued capital stock, in favor of dissolving the corporation, and the board of directors was authorized to take the court action prescribed by the laws of Utah, under which the company was organized, to accomplish such dissolution. Suit for this purpose was instituted in the appropriate state court.\n On November 6, 1911, five months after the resolution in favor of dissolution was adopted, the bill in this case was filed by minority stockholders, praying for a decree, that the deed of May 31, 1910, be declared void, that it be delivered up and canceled, that the consideration for it be returned to the Anaconda Company, and that all court proceedings to dissolve the Alice Company be stayed pending final decree in the case. The District Court approved and confirmed the sale, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is here on appeal.\n The appellants claimed in the courts below and argue here that the sale was voidable for four reasons, viz.:\n\n\n (1)\n Because the purchase was made in pursuit of the purpose of the Amalgamated Copper Company and the Anaconda Company to monopolize the production of copper in the Butte Camp and to restrain the sale of it in interstate commerce and in the markets of the world, in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act;\n\n\n (2)\n Because the owners of less than all of the capital stock of the Alice Company could not authorize the sale of all of the property of the corporation over the protest of owners of a minority of the stock; \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n (3) Because the Alice Company could not lawfully acquire stock in another corporation; and\n\n\n (4)\n Because the sale was negotiated by two boards of directors, with a common membership, and for an inadequate consideration.\n We shall consider these claims in the order stated.\n With respect to the first contention. It is now the settled law that the remedies provided by the Anti-Trust Act of 1890 (Comp. St.  8820- 8823, 8827-8830) for enforcing the rights created by it are exclusive, and therefore, looking only to that act, a suit, such as we have here, would not now be entertained. Wilder v. Corn Products Refining Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 398, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 118; Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 718; United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 464. But the law has become thus settled since this suit was commenced in 1911, and the lower courts, upon the allegations in the bill, properly assumed jurisdiction and disposed of the case. Busch v. Jones, \n184 \nU.S. 598, 599\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 511; Clark v. Wooster, \n119 \nU.S. 322, 326\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 217.\n It is, however, argued that section 16 of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730, 737 [Comp. St.  88350]), passed in 1914, was intended to, and does, modify the prior law, as declared by this court, and, since our decision will result in remanding the cause to the lower court, we shall consider its bearing upon the case.\n The applicable provision of the Clayton Act is as follows:\n'Sec. 16. That any person ... shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the anti-trust laws ... when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings. ...'\n\n The contention of the appellants is that they will suffer irreparable loss by the sale of the Alice properties to the \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 594]\n\u00a0\n Anaconda Company, and that the sale should therefore be enjoined because that company and the Amalgamated Copper Company constitute a combination in restraint of interstate commerce within the prohibitions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\n The Amalgamated Copper Company, organized in 1899, is a holding company, and in 1911, when this case was commenced, it controlled by capital stock ownership the Anaconda Company which, in turn, held the title to the physical property which had been owned by other corporations, the union of which in this manner in the Amalgamated and Anaconda Companies constituted the alleged unlawful combination in restraint of interstate trade or commerce.\n The evidence in the case renders it probable, that the promoters of the Amalgamated Company, when it was organized in 1899, entertained schemes or dreams of controlling the supply and price of copper in the interstate markets of this country and in the markets of the world, and that they did what they could to make that company rich and powerful.\n But we are dealing with the Anaconda Company as it was in 1911 and with the extent to which its control of production and of prices appears in the record before us.\n There is evidence that the total production of copper in the United States and Alaska in 1899, was 581 million pounds, and of the Anaconda Company 1 million pounds (probably an error, 100 million pounds being intended); but the total production of the world at that time is nowhere stated. The production in the United States in 1910, the year before the suit was brought, was 1,086 million pounds, and of this Butte Camp, in which there were several mines other than those of defendants, produced 238 million pounds, or approximately 22 per cent. Here again there is no statement as to the total production of the world for that year. \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 595]\n\u00a0\n Whatever the fact may have been, it is obvious that from such evidence as this it is not possible to determine to what, if to any substantial extent, the defendants restrained or monopolized the production of copper in the United States, much less in the world.\n The evidence with respect to price control, although meager, is more definite. The average price of copper in 1899, the year before the Amalgamated Copper Company was organized, was 17.6 per pound; in 1900 it was 16.1; in 1902, 11.6; in 1904, 12.8; in 1907, 20; in 1908, 13; in 1909, 12.98; 1912, 16; and in 1913, the last year for which the price is given, 15 cents.\n It is obviously impossible to say that these fluctuating prices prove monopolistic control of the price of copper by the defendants.\n No claim is made that the Anaconda Company restrained or restricted the production of copper, but so far as there is any evidence at all upon the subject it is to the effect that it maintained and perhaps increased the production in the Butte Camp.\n Upon the case here made by the evidence it is impossible to conclude that the defendants constituted in 1911 such a combination, within the terms of the Anti-Trust Act, as would justify the granting of an injunction to the plaintiffs even the provisions of section 16 of the Clayton Act, which we have quoted.\n The decree of the lower courts as to this first claim must be affirmed.\n The second contention is that the owners of less than all of the capital stock of the Alice Company could not authorize the sale of all of the property of the corporation over the protest of owners of a minority of the stock.\n It is, of course, a general rule of law that, in the absence of special authority so to do, the owners of a majority of the stock of a corporation have not the power to authorize the directors to sell all of the property of the company and \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 596]\n\u00a0\n thereby abandon the enterprise for which it was organized. But to this rule there is an exception, as well established as the rule itself, viz. that when, from any cause, the business of a corporation, not charged with duties to the public, has proved so unprofitable that there is no reasonable prospect of conducting the business in the future without loss, or when the corporation has not, and cannot obtain, the money necessary to pay its debts and to continue the business for which it was organized, even though it may not be insolvent in the commercial sense, the owners of a majority of the capital stock, in their judgment and discretion exercised in good faith, may authorize the sale of all the property of the company for an adequate consideration, and distribute among the stockholders what remains of the proceeds after the payment of its debts, even over the objection of the owners of the minority of such stock. Thompson on Corporations (2d Ed.)  2424-2429; Noyes on Intercorporate Relations,  111; Cook on Corporations (7th Ed.)  670, p. 217, note.\n The rule that owners of a majority of the stock may not authorize the sale of all of the property of a going and not unprofitable company rests upon the principle that exercise of such power would defeat the implied contract among the stockholders to pursue the purpose for which it was chartered. But this principle fails of application when a business, unsuccessful from whatever cause, is suspended without prospect of revival, and the law recognizes that under such conditions the majority stockholders have rights as well as the minority, and that it should not require the former to remain powerless until the creeping paralysis of inactivity shall have destroyed the investment of both.\n The case before us is a typical one for the application of this exception to the general rule. The Alice Company was organized in 1880, under the general incorporation laws of the then territory of Utah, with authority \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 597]\n\u00a0\n to buy, sell, lease, hold, own and operate mines, mining claims, etc., with many enumerated incidental powers. It acquired the mining properties in controversy in this case and conducted prosperously the mining chiefly of silver ores until 1893, when its business ceased to be profitable and was suspended. Extensive shafts and underground workings were permitted to fill with water and for 17 years before the sale the only business done by the company was leasing the upper workings of the old mines, and limited parts of the surface for shallow workings, to 'tributors,' who operated in such a small way that, although the expenses of the company, chiefly for caretakers, were very small, its income was less, so that when the sale was made an indebtedness of about $35,000 had accumulated. The stock of the company was nonassessable, it had no resources but the real estate which was sold to the Anaconda Company, and the evidence is clear that to reopen and operate the mines on its property, or to open new mines, would have been very expensive and the prospect of profitable operation of them wholly problematical. Although its properties had a large speculative value, and therefore the company cannot be said to have been insolvent, yet it must be accepted as established by the evidence that there was no reasonable prospect of the company being able to profitably resume the mining business for which it was incorporated, and that the only way in which the stockholders could realize anything from their investment was by sale of its property. Under such circumstances as these the sale of all of the property of the company, if authorized, in good faith and for an adequate consideration, by the owners of a majority of the stock would be a valid sale, which could not be defeated or set aside by the minority stockholders.\n It is next argued that the sale here in controversy is void for the reason that the Alice Company could \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 598]\n\u00a0\n not lawfully acquire and hold title to the stock in the Anaconda Company, in which the consideration for the sale was paid.\n Here again the general rule is that while, under the circumstances of this case, a sale of all of the property of a corporation could be authorized by the owners of less than all of the stock for an adequate consideration, it must be for money only, for the reason that the minority stockholders may not lawfully be compelled to accept a change of investment made for them by others, or to elect between losing their interests or entering a new company.\n But it has been suggested that this rule, also, should be subject to the exception that when stock which has an established market value is taken in exchange for corporation property, it should be treated as the equivalent of money, and that a sale, otherwise valid, should be sustained. Noyes, Intercorporate Relations,  120 and cases cited. We approve the soundness of such an exception. It would be a reproach to the law to invalidate a sale, otherwise valid, because not made for money, when it is made for stock which a stockholder receiving it may at once, in the New York or other general market, convert into an adequate cash consideration for what his holdings were in the corporate property.\n In this case the trial judge determined without difficulty the market value of the stock received in payment for the Alice properties, and it is, of course, public knowledge that there was a wide and general market for Anaconda stock. This third contention of appellant must be benied.\n Finally, it is argued that the sale of the Alice properties is void because negotiated and made by two boards of directors having a member in common and for an inadequate consideration.\n John D. Ryan at the time of the sale was president and a director of the Alice Company; he was also a director \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 599]\n\u00a0\n and general manager of the Anaconda Company and had been its president from 1903 to 1909; he was elected a director and president of the Amalgamated Copper Company in 1909, and had been a director of each of the subsidiary companies of the combination prior to that year. In 1905 he obtained an option on the majority of the Alice stock for $600,000, and carried it until it was purchased by the Butte Coalition Company, an Amalgamated subsidiary, of which he was a director, and that company voted a majority of the Alice stock in favor of the disputed sale.\n The record shows beyond controversy that Ryan was the representative of the chief investors in the enterprise involved in this litigation, that he dominated the conduct of the practical administration of the affairs of the Amalgamated and Anaconda Companies, and that he very certainly was in control of the boards of directors of the companies which were parties to the sale of the Alice properties.\n The relation of directors to corporations is of such a fiduciary nature that transactions between boards having common members are regarded as jealously by the law as are personal dealings between a director and his corporation, and where the fairness of such transactions is challenged the burden is upon those who would maintain them to show their entire fairness and where a sale is involved the full adequacy of the consideration. Especially is this true where a common director is dominating in influence or in character. This court has been consistently emphatic in the application of this rule, which, it has declared, is founded in soundest morality, and we now add in the soundest business policy. Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, \n91 U.S. 587\n, 588; Thomas v. Brownville, etc., R. R. Co., \n109 U.S. 522\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 315; Wardell v. Railroad Co., \n103 U.S. 651\n, 658; Corsicana National Bank v. Johnson, \n251 \nU.S. 68, 90\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 82. \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 600]\n\u00a0\n The District Court found that the price agreed to be paid by the Anaconda Comapny was not an adequate one, and the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to disturb that finding. With this conclusion we agree, applying the settled rule of this court that in suits in equity a concurrent finding by two courts on a question of fact will be accepted unless it be clear that their conclusion is erroneous. Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 333, and cases cited.\n But the District Court, notwithstanding this finding of inadequacy of price, did not set the sale aside but ordered that the Alice properties should be offered at public auction by a master and that if no bid should be received for an amount greater than that which the Anaconda Company had agreed to pay, the sale should be confirmed. The offer at public sale was made, no bid was received and the private sale to the Anaconda Company was thereupon confirmed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, affirmed that decree.\n Both courts relied upon Mason v. Pewabic Mining Co., \n133 U.S. 50\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 224, as authority for approving the sale for a price which they found was inadequate, after a greater amount could not be obtained for the property when offered at public sale, and in this we think they fell into error.\n In the Pewabic Case the charter period of the corporation having expired, a majority of the stockholders favored the organization of a new company, with the same amount of capital stock as the old, to take over the whole of its property, and that there should be allotted to the stockholders the same number of shares which they held in the old company, or, in the alternative, that those who did not desire the stock should receive the value of their shares computed on a basis of $50,000 for the entire property of the company. The minority stockholders favored sale of the property and division of the proceeds. \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 601]\n\u00a0\n On bill filed by the minority stockholders the Circuit Court enjoined the transfer to the new company and ordered a public sale of the property by a master, with a proviso in the decree that if no bids were offered in excess of $50,000 above the debts of the company then the proposal of the majority should be carried into effect under the direction of the master. Before the property was offered for sale each of the parties appealed to this court from separate parts of the decree. On that appeal, in addition to a question of accounting, not material here, this court considered and decided only the question, whether on such a winding up of the affairs of a corporation the majority of the stockholders could lawfully compel the minority to either take stock in a new company or accept for their stock a value to be fixed by the majority. No mention is made in the opinion of the court of the alternative character of the order of sale, and, although it was subsequently shown that the price proposed was an inadequate one, there had not been any finding by the lower court that such was the fact when the case was decided here. It is probable that there was no objection to this feature of the decree. The minority stockholders, praying, as they were, for a public sale, for obvious reasons would not object to it, and the contention of the majority was that no sale at all should be ordered, but that their reorganization plan should be adopted. The decree of the Circuit Court that the property should be sold at public sale was confirmed without any reference being made to the action ordered if the upset price should not be obtained, and we must conclude that that part of the decree was not considered by this court.\n As an original proposition, we cannot think that the amount offered for property at a public sale for cash is such a measure of its value that the failure to obtain a bid at such sale for more should be accepted by courts as a sufficient reason for affirming a sale for a price which they \n\n[254 U.S. 590, 602]\n\u00a0\n found, on other evidence, to be inadequate. In business life forced sales for cash are such a last resort for obtaining money that a sale 'under the hammer' is synonymous with a sale at a sacrifice, and prices obtained at such sales have usually been rejected by courts when tendered as evidence of value.\n In this case, from evidence as to the character of the Alice properties, their location and surroundings, and from the opinions of experts, the trial court concluded that the price paid for them was inadequate, and we cannot doubt that from like or other evidence a more trustworthy conclusion could be obtained as to what their value was than would be derived from an offer at a public sale for cash.\n To this it must be added that the resolutions of the Alice Company to sell and of the Anaconda Company to purchase were for a price named to be paid and received in designated stock. Neither contemplated a public offering of the properties, and that a sale should be made at another price, greater than an amount decreed by the court, if it should be offered. Under the pleadings the court had power to confirm the sale if it was found to have been lawfully made, but only upon the terms on which the parties had contracted to make it, and when the price was found to be inadequate, a decree should have been entered vacating and setting it aside, as prayed for by the appellants.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILPIN v.

C., the authority to convene a general court-martial.\n\n\n (2)\n General Court-Martial Orders No. 139, issued by the War Department under date of April 29, 1919, announcing that under Special Orders, No. 172, dated 'October 10, 1918, Headquarters, Camp Sevier, S. C.' (issued by the commanding officer of that camp), a general court-martial had convened at Camp Sevier on October 30, 1918, and before it there was arraigned and tried 'Captain William J. Givens, Infantry, United States Army,' under the charge of having murdered at or near Camp Sevier a named private soldier; that at the trial the accused officer had pleaded not guilty, and although acquitted of the charge of murder had been found guilty of manslaughter, and had been sentenced to dismissal from the army and to 10 years at hard labor at a place to be designated by the reviewing authority. The order \n\n[255 U.S. 11, 17]\n\u00a0\n further recited the approval of the sentence by the reviewing authority ( the commander at Camp Sevier), and a like approval, with direction that the sentence be executed, made by the President on April 14, 1919, and concluded by announcing the dismissal of the convicted officer from the army as of the date of April 30, 1919\n\n\n\n\n (3)\n A telegram from the War Department to the commander at Camp Sevier announcing the approval of the sentence by the President, the dismissal of the officer from the army, that the United States penitentiary at Atlanta, Ga., was designated as the place of confinement, and directing the said commander to deliver the officer to that penitentiary.\n\n\n (4)\n A letter from the Adjutant General of the Army of date April 29, 1919, directed to the warden of the penitentiary at Atlanta, transmitting him a copy of the telegram sent to the commanding officer at Camp Sevier, as previously stated, and informing him that in due season a copy of the official order promulgating the trial, conviction, and approval of the sentence, would be sent to him.\n Upon a traverse of the return and the pleadings the case was heard and in a careful opinion the court, maintaining the sufficiency of the return, discharged the writ and remanded the petitioner to custody, and as the result of an appeal the correctness of its action is here for decision.\n The grounds relied upon for reversal relate to three subjects: (1) The alleged illegality of the court because of want of power in the officer by whom it was called to convene it; (2) the failure of the record to show that the accused was an officer in the army or was in any way amenable to trial by court-martial, and the absence of jurisdiction in the court, in any event, to try a charge of murder because by law no person could be tried by court-martial for murder committed within the United \n\n[255 U.S. 11, 18]\n\u00a0\n States in time of peace, and there was no averment negativing a time of peace, and that in fact peace prevailed at the time of the trial; (3) the asserted unlawfulness of the confinement of the petitioner in the penitentiary at Atlanta because the record failed to establish that the place had been designated by the President, the final reviewing authority.\n We come to test these grounds in the order stated. The court was undoubtedly a general court-martial and was convened by the commander of Camp Sevier. The power to convoke it, however, is not to be solely measured by the authority possessed by a camp commander, but in the light of the authority given to the President by the eighth Article of War (Comp. St.  2308a), to empower 'the commanding officer of any district or of any force or body of troops' to appoint general courts-martial, and by the exertion of that power by the President manifested by General Orders, No. 56, conferring upon the commanding officer at Camp Sevier the authority to call a general court-martial. True, it is insisted that the words, 'the commanding officer of any district or of any force or body of troops,' are not broad enough to embrace the commanding officer at Camp Sevier; that, in issuing Order No. 56, the President therefore exceeded the power conferred upon him, and hence that Order No. 56, in so far as it gave the power stated to camp commanders, was void. But the text of article 8 so clearly demonstrates the unsoundness of the contention that we deem it unnecessary to refer further to it. And as General Orders, No. 56, was a part of the law of the land, which we judicially notice without averment or proof (Gratiot v. United States, 4 How. 80, 117; Jenkins v. Collard, \n145 \nU.S. 547, 560\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 868; Caha v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 211, 221\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 513), we think the contention that that law should not have been enforced because it was not referred to by the camp commander in exerting the power which he possessed in virtue of that order is also without merit. \n\n[255 U.S. 11, 19]\n\u00a0\n These conclusions render no longer applicable the contention that the court-martial was without jurisdiction because a special court appointed by a camp commander had no jurisdiction to try an officer with the rank of captain, but they do not dispose of the proposition that the record failed to show that the accused belonged to the army without reference to his rank and was therefore subject to trial by a military court.\n Conceding that the possession by the accused of a status essential to the exercise by the court-martial of its power was jurisdictional and therefore may not be held to have existed merely because of an estoppel, and conceding further that, except for the form of the charge, the record failed to establish such status, we are brought to determine, as was the lower court, whether evidence was admissible to show such capacity at the time of the trial and conviction and thus make clear the precise condition upon which the court acted.\n Undoubtedly courts-martial are tribunals of special and limited jurisdiction whose judgments, so far as questions relating to their jurisdiction are concerned, are always open to collateral attack. True, also, is it that in consequence of the limited nature of the power of such courts the right to have exerted their jurisdiction, when called in question by collateral attack, will be held not to have existed unless it appears that the grounds which were necessary to justify the exertion of the assailed authority existed at the time of its exertion and therefore were or should have been a part of the record. Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch, 331; Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 209; Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65; Runkle v. United States, \n122 \nU.S. 543, 555\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1141; McClaughry v. Deming, \n186 U.S. 49\n, 62-63, 22 Sup. Ct. 786.\n The question before us is thus a narrow one, since it comes only to this: In a case, such as that before us, where the power to convoke a court-martial is established \n\n[255 U.S. 11, 20]\n\u00a0\n on the face of the record and the authority of the court to decide the particular subject before it is therefore undoubted, does the right exist, in the event of a collateral attack upon the judgment rendered, made on the ground that a particular jurisdictional fact upon which the court acted is not shown by the record to have been established, to meet such attack by proof as to the existence of the fact which the court treated as adequately present for the purpose of the power exerted?\n Considering that subject in the light stated, we think the court below was right in admitting, as it did, evidence to show the existence of a military status in the accused, since it did not change the court- martial record but simply met the collateral attack by showing that at the time of the trial the basis existed for the exertion by the court of the authority conferred upon it.\n It is true that general expressions will be found in some of the reported cases to the effect that wherever a fact upon which the jurisdiction of a court-martial or other court of limited jurisdiction depends is questioned it must appear in the record that such fact was established. But these expressions should be limited in accordance with the ruling which we now make. We so conclude because the complete right to collaterally assail the existence of every fact which was essential to the exercise by such a limited court of its authority, whether appearing on the face of the record or not, is wholly incompatible with the conception that, when a collateral attack is made, the face of the record is conclusive. Indeed, some of the leading cases make clear the incongruity of any other conclusion and serve to indicate that the expressions as to the face of the record contemplate, not the record assailed by the collateral attack, but the record established as the result of the proof heard on such attack. Galpin v. Page, 18 Wall. 350; Runkle v. United States, \n122 U.S. 543\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1141.\n Although there is no bill of exceptions, as the case is \n\n[255 U.S. 11, 21]\n\u00a0\n here on appeal the evidence upon which the court below acted is open for our consideration and would seem to be in the record, although a compliance with the praecipe of the appellant would have required the clerk to exclude it. Under these conditions we content ourselves with saying that, if as a consequence of the action of the appellant the proof is not in the record, the means of examining the conclusion of the court in that respect would be wanting and we could not disturb the decree appealed from. If on the other hand the documents in the record, not referred to by the praecipe of the appellant, embraced the proof which the court admitted and upon which it acted, we are of opinion that they abundantly sustain the conclusion which the court based upon them and therefore make clear the existence at the time of the trial of a military status in the accused officer adequate to sustain the jurisdiction of the court-martial.\n The contention, that the court was without jurisdiction because the trial occurred in a time of peace and that under that condition Article of War 92 deprived courts-martial of jurisdiction to try for murder, has been held to be without merit in Kahn et al. v. Anderson, Warden (No. 421, this day decided) \n255 U.S. 1\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 224, 65 L. Ed. --, which therefore disposes of that question as presented here. This renders it unnecessary to consider the government's insistence, that as the conviction was for manslaughter, the trial was for that crime, although the charge was murder.\n As respects the designation of the penitentiary at Atlanta as the place for executing the sentence at hard labor which was imposed, we are of opinion that if effect be given to documents which are in the record and to which the lower court referred it would clearly result that the court rightly held that under the conditions disclosed, the order for confinement at Atlanta was virtually the order of the President, and the contention to the contrary now made is devoid of merit.

But, as pointed out by the court below, the mere designation of the place for carrying out the sentence did not involve the jurisdiction of the court (Schwab v. Berggren, \n143 \nU.S. 442, 451\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 525; In re Cross, \n146 U.S. 271\n, 277-278, 13 Sup. Ct. 109), and if erroneous would only lead to retaining the accused for a new designation of place of confinement, and we see no reason under the condition of the record to reverse the action of the court below on that subject.\n What we have said disposes of every material contention in the case, although we have not expressly noticed the many suggestions based upon the supposed duty on the trial, before the court-martial, to negative every possible condition the existence of which might have prevented that court from trying the case, among which was the possibility that the officer under trial might have belonged to a command which did not come within the power to call a court-martial conferred upon the camp commander by General Orders, No. 56, particularly since the suggestion now made on that subject seems to have been an afterthought and not to have been called to the attention of the court below in any way.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOODRICH v. EDWARDS(1921)\nNo. 663\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. William D. Guthrie, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.[ Goodrich v. Edwards \n255 U.S. 527\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[255 U.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error sued the defendant, a Collector of Internal Revenue, to recover income taxes assessed in 1920 for the year 1916 and paid under protest to avoid penalties. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, and the constitutional validity of a law of the United States is so involved that the case is properly here by writ of error. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254.\n Two transactions are involved.\n\n\n (1)\n In 1912 the plaintiff in error purchased 1,000 shares of the capital stock of a mining company for which he paid $500. It is averred that the stock was worth $695 on March 1, 1913, and that it was sold in March, 1916, for $13,931.22. The tax which the plaintiff in error seeks to recover was assessed on the difference between the \n\n[255 U.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and the amount for which it was sold.\n\n\n (2)\n The plaintiff in error being the owner of shares of the capital stock of another corporation, in 1912 exchanged them for stock, in a reorganized company, of the then value of $291,600. It is averred and admitted that on March 1, 1913, the value of this stock was $148,635.50, and that it was sold in 1916 for $269,346.25. Although it is thus apparent that the stock involved was of less value on March 1, 1913, than when it was acquired, and that it was ultimately sold at a loss to the owner, nevertheless the collector assessed the tax on the difference between the value on March 1, 1913, and the amount for which it was sold.\n The plaintiff in error seeks to recover the whole of these two assessments.\n The same contention is made with respect to each of these payments as was made in No. 608, Merchants' Loan & Trust Co., as Trustee, v. Julius F. Smietanka, Collector of Internal Revenue, \n255 U.S. 509\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 386, 65 L. Ed. --, this day decided, viz. that the amounts realized from the sales of the stocks were in their inherent nature capital as distinguished from income, being an increment in value of the securities while owned and held as an investment, and therefore not taxable under the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756), as amended in 1917 (40 Stat. 300), or under any constitutional law.\n With respect to the first payment. It is plain that this assessment was on the profit accruing after March 1, 1913, the effective date of the act, realized to the owner by the sale after deducting his capital investment. The question involved is ruled by No. 608, supra, and the amount was properly taxed.\n As to the second payment. The government confesses error in the judgment with respect to this assessment. The stock was sold in the year for which the tax was assessed for $22,253.75 less than its value when it was \n\n[255 U.S. 527, 535]\n\u00a0\n acquired, but for $120,710.75 more than its value on March 1, 1913, and the tax was assessed on the latter amount.\n The act under which the assessment was made provides that the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from ... sales or dealings in property, whether real or personal ... or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. 39 Stat. 757; 40 Stat. 300, 307.\n Section 2(c) of this same act provides that--\n'For the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, acquired before March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, the fair market price or value of such property as of March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, shall be the basis for determining the amount of such gain derived.'\n\n And the definition of 'income' approved by this Court is:\n\"The gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,' provided it be understood to include profits gained through sale or conversion of capital assets.' Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 193 (64 L. Ed. 521, 9 A. L. R. 1570).\n\n It is thus very plain that the statute imposes the income tax on the proceeds of the sale of personal property to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by the vendor, and we therefore agree with the Solicitor General that since no gain was realized on this investment by the plaintiff in error no tax should have been assessed against him.\n Section 2(c) is applicable only where a gain over the original capital investment has been realized after March 1, 1913, from a sale or other disposition of property.\n It results that the judgment of the District Court as to the first assessment, as we have described it, is affirmed, that as to the second assessment it is reversed, and the case \n\n[255 U.S. 527, 536]\n\u00a0\n is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed in part.\n Affirmed in part.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, because of prior decisions of the Court, concur only in the judgment. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOULED v. U.S.(1921)\nNo. 250\nArgued: January 4, 1920Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes and Martin W. Littleton, both of New York City, for Gouled.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a joint indictment the plaintiff in error, Gouled, one Vaughan, an officer of the United States Army, and a third, an attorney at law, were charged in the first count with being parties to a conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of section 37 of the federal Criminal Code ( Comp. St.  10201), and, in the second count, with having used the mails to \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n promote a scheme to defraud the United States, in violation of section 215 of that Code (section 10384). Vaughan pleaded guilty, the attorney was acquitted, and Gouled, whom we shall refer to as the defendant, was convicted, and thereupon prosecuted error to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certifies to this court six questions which we are to consider.\n Of these questions, the first two relate to the admission in evidence of a paper surreptitiously taken from the office of the defendant by one acting under direction of officers of the Intelligence Department of the Army of the United States, and the remaining four relate to papers taken from defendant's office under two search warrants, issued pursuant to the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, 288 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10496 1\/4 a-10496 1\/4 v]). It was objected on the trial, and is here insisted upon, that it was error to admit these papers in evidence because possession of them was obtained by violating the rights secured to the defendant by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n The Fourth Amendment reads:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n The part of the Fifth Amendment here involved reads:\n'No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'\n\n It would not be possible to add to the emphasis with which the framers of our Constitution and this court (in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524, in Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann Cas. 1915C, 1177, and in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 U.S. 385\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 182) have declared the importance to political liberty and to the welfare of our country of the due observance of the rights guaranteed under the Constitution \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n by these two amendments. The effect of the decisions cited is: That such rights are declared to be indispensable to the 'full enjoyment of personal security, personal liberty and private property'; that they are to be regarded as of the very essence of constitutional liberty; and that the guaranty of them is as important and as imperative as are the guaranties of the other fundamental rights of the individual citizen-the right to trial by jury, to the writ of habeas corpus, and to due process of law. It has been repeatedly decided that these amendments should receive a liberal construction, so as to prevent stealthy encroachment upon or 'gradual depreciation' of the rights secured by them, by imperceptible practice of courts or by well-intentioned, but mistakenly overzealous, executive officers.\n In the spirit of these decisions we must deal with the questions before us.\n The facts derived from the certificate, cssential to be considered in answering the first two questions, are: That in January, 1918, it was suspected that the defendant, Gouled, and Vaughan were conspiring to defraud the government through contracts with it for clothing and equipment; that one Cohen, a private in the Army, attached to the Intelligence Department, and a business acquaintance of defendant Gouled, under direction of his superior officers, pretending to make a friendly call upon the defendant gained admission to his office and in his absence, without warrant of any character, seized and carried away several documents; that one of these papers, described as 'of evidential value only' and belonging to Gouled, was subsequently delivered to the United States District Attorney, and was by him introduced in evidence over the objection of the defendant that possession of it was obtained by a violation of the Fourth or Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; and that the defendant did not know that Cohen had carried away any of his papers until \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n he appeared on the witness stand and detailed the facts with respect thereto as we have stated them, when, necessarily, objection was first made to the admission of the paper in evidence.\n Out of these facts arise the first two questions, both relating to the paper thus seized. The first of these is:\n'Is the secret taking, without force, from the house or office of one suspected of crime, of a paper belonging to him, of evidential value only, by a representative of any branch or subdivision of the government of the United States, a violation of the Fourth Amendment?'\n\n The ground on which the trial court overruled the objection to this paper is not stated, but from the certificate and the argument we must infer that it was admitted, either because it appeared that the possession of it was obtained without the use of force or illegal coercion, or because the objection to it came too late.\n The objection was not too late, for, coming as it did promptly upon the first notice the defendant had that the government was in possession of the paper, the rule of practice relied upon, that such an objection will not be entertained unless made before trial, was obviously inapplicable.\n The prohibition of the Fourth Amendment is against all unreasonable searches and seizures and if for a government officer to obtain entrance to a man's house or office by force or by an illegal threat or show of force, amounting to coercion, and then to search for and seize his private papers would be an unreasonable and therefore a prohibited search and seizure, as it certainly would be, it is impossible to successfully contend that a like search and seizure would be a reasonable one if only admission were obtained by stealth instead of by force or coercion. The secutiry and privacy of the home or office and of the papers of the owner would be as much invaded and the search and \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n seizure would be as much against his will in the one case as in the other, and it must therefore be regarded as equally in violation of his constitutional rights.\n Without discussing them, we cannot doubt that such decisions as there are in conflict with this conclusion are unsound, and that, whether entrance to the home or office of a person suspected of crime be obtained by a representative of any branch or subdivision of the government of the United States by stealth, or through social acquaintance, or in the guies of a business call, and whether the owner be present or not when he enters, any search and seizure subsequently and secretly made in his absence, falls within the scope of the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment, and therefore the answer to the first question must be in the affirmative.\n The second question reads:\n'Is the admission of such paper in evidence against the same person when indicted for crime a violation of the Fifth Amendment?'\n\n Upon authority of the Boyd Case, supra, this second question must also be answered in the affirmative. In practice the result is the same to one accused of crime, whether he be obliged to supply evidence against himself or whether such evidence be obtained by an illegal search of his premises and seizure of his private papers. In either case he is the unwilling source of the evidence, and the Fifth Amendment forbids that he shall be compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.\n The remaining four questions relate to three other papers which were admitted in evidence on the trial over the same constitutional objections as were interposed to the admission of the first paper. One was an unexecuted form of contract between the defendant and one Lavinsky; another was a written contract, signed by the defendant and one Steinthal; and the third was a bill for \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n disbursements and professional services rendered by the attorney at law to the defendant Gouled.\n Of these papers, the first was seized in defendant's office under a search warrant dated June 17, and the other two under a like warrant dated July 22, 1918, each of which was issued by a United States commissioner on the affidavit of an agent of the Department of Justice. It is certified that it was averred in the first affidavit that there were in Gouled's office 'certain property, to wit, certain contracts of the said Felix Gouled with S. Lavinsky which were used as a means of committing a felony, to wit, ... as a means for the bribery of a certain officer of the United States.' It is also certified that the second affidavit declared that Gouled had at his office 'certain letters, papers, documents and writings which relate to and have been used in the commission of a felony, to wit, a conspiracy to defraud the United States.' Neither the affidavits nor the warrants are given in full in the certificate, but no exception was taken to the sufficiency of either.\n After the seizure of the papers, a joint indictment was returned, as stated, against Gouled, Vaughan, and the attorney, and before trial a motion was made by Gouled for a return of the papers seized under the search warrants, which was denied, and when the motion was renewed at the trial, but before any evidence was introduced, it was again denied. The denial of this motion is not assigned as error.\n The contract of the defendant with Steinthal, which was seized under the warrant, was not offered in evidence but a duplicate original, obtained from Steinthal, was admitted over the objection that the possession of the seized original must have suggested the existence and the obtaining of the counterpart, and that therefore the use of it in evidence would violate the rights of the defendant under the Fourth or Fifth Amendment.

There is no statement in the certificate of the contents of these papers, but it is said of them only, that they belonged to Gouled, that they were without pecuniary value, and that they constituted evidence 'more or less injurious to the defendant.'\n It is apparent from this statement that to answer the remaining four questions involves a consideration of the applicable law of search warrants.\n The wording of the Fourth Amendment implies that search warrants were in familiar use when the Constitution was adopted and, plainly, that when issued 'upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized,' searches, and seizures made under them, are to be regarded as not unreasonable, and therefore not prohibited by the amendment. Searches and seizures are as constitutional under the amendment when made under valid search warrants as they are unconstitutional, because unreasonable, when made without them-the permission of the amendment has the same constitutional warrant as the prohibition has, and the definition of the former restrains the scope of the latter. All of this is abundantly recognized in the opinions of the Boyd and Weeks Cases, supra, in which it is pointed out that at the time the Constitution was adopted stolen or forfeited property, or property liable to duties and concealed to avoid payment of them, excisable articles and books required by law to be kept with respect to them, counterfeit coin, burglars' tools and weapons, implements of gambling 'and many other things of like character' might be searched for in home or office and if found might be seized, under search warrants, lawfully applied for, issued and executed. \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 309]\n\u00a0\n Although search warrants have thus been used in many cases ever since the adoption of the Constitution, and although their use has been extended from time to time to meet new cases within the old rules, nevertheless it is clear that, at common law and as the result of the Boyd and Weeks Cases, supra, they may not be used as a means of gaining access to a man's house or office and papers solely for the purpose of making search to secure evidence to be used against him in a criminal or penal proceeding, but that they may be resorted to only when a primary right to such search and seizure may be found in the interest which the public or the complainant may have in the property to be seized, or in the right to the possession of it, or when a valid exercise of the police power renders possession of the property by the accused unlawful and provides that it may be taken. Boyd Case, \n116 \nU.S. 623, 624\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 524.\n There is no special sanctity in papers, as distinguished from other forms of property, to render them immune from search and seizure, if only they fall within the scope of the principles of the cases in which other property may be seized, and if they be adequately described in the affidavit and warrant. Stolen or forged papers have been so seized, Langdon v. People, 133 Ill. 382, 24 N. E. 874, and lottery tickets, under a statute prohibiting their possession with intent to sell them, Commonwealth v. Dana, 2 Metc. (Mass.) 329, and we cannot doubt that contracts may be so used as instruments or agencies for perpetrating frauds upon the government as to give the public an interest in them which would justify the search for and seizure of them, under a properly issued search warrant, for the purpose of preventing further frauds.\n With these principles of law in mind, we come to the remaining questions.\n The third question reads:\n'Are papers of no pecuniary value but possessing evidential value against persons presently suspected and subsequently indicted under \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 310]\n\u00a0\n sections 37 and 215 of the United States Criminal Code, when taken under search warrants issued pursuant to the Act of June 15, 1917, from the house or office of the person suspected, seized and taken in violation of the Fourth Amendment?'\n\n That the papers involved are of no pecuniary value is of no significance. Many papers, having no pecuniary value to others, are of the greatest possible value to the owners and are property of a most important character (Boyd Case, supra, \n116 \nU.S. 627, 628\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 524), and since those here involved possessed 'evidential value' against the defendant, we must assume that they were relevant to the issue.\n Restraining the questions to the papers described, and first as to the unexecuted form of contract with Lavinsky, a stranger to the indictment. While the contents of this paper are not given, it is impossible to see how the government could have such an interest in such a paper that under the principles of law stated it would have the right to take it into its possession to prevent injury to the public from its use. The government could desire its possession only to use it as evidence against the defendant and to search for and seize it for such purpose was unlawful.\n Likewise the public could be interested in the bill of the attorney for legal services only to the extent that it might be used as evidence and the seizure of this also was unlawful.\n As to the contract with Steinthal, also a stranger to the indictment: It is not difficult, as we have said, to imagine how an executed written contract might be an important agency or instrumentality in the bribing of a public servant and in perpetrating frauds upor the government, so that it would have a legitimate and important interest in seizing such a paper in order to prevent further frauds, but the facts necessary to give this contract such a character do not appear in the certificate. On the contrary, \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 311]\n\u00a0\n this third question recites that the papers are all of no pecuniary, but are of evidential, value, and in the sixth question it is recited that they are 'of evidential value only,' so that it is impossible to say, on the record before us, that the government had any interest in it other than as evidence against the accused, and therefore as to all three papers the answer to the question must be in the affirmative.\n The fourth question reads:\n'If such papers so taken are admitted in evidence against the person from whose house or office they were taken, such person being then on trial for the crime for which he was accused in the affidavit for warrant, is such admission in evidence a violation of the Fifth Amendment?'\n\n The same papers being involved, the answer to this question must be in the affirmative, for, they having been seized in an unconstitutional search, to permit them to be used in evidence would be, in effect, as ruled in the Boyd Case, to compel the defendant to become a witness against himself.'\n The fifth question reads:\n'If in the affidavit for search warrant under Act of June 15, 1917, the party whose premises are to be searched be charged with one crime and property be taken under the warrant issued thereon, can such property so seized be introduced in evidence against said party when on trial for a different offense?'\n\n It has never been required that a criminal prosecution should be pending against a person in order to justify search for and seizure of his property under a proper warrant, if a case of crime having been committed and of probable cause is made out sufficient to satisfy the law and the officer having authority to issue it, and we see no reason why property seized under a valid search warrant, when thus lawfully obtained by the government, may not be used in the prosecution of a suspected person for a crime other than that which may have been described \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 312]\n\u00a0\n in the affidavit as having been committed by him. The question assumes that the property seized was obtained on a search warrant sufficient in form to satisfy the law, and if the papers to which the question refers had been of a character to be thus obtained, lawfully, it would have been competent to use them to prove any crime against the accused as to which they constituted relevant evidence.\n The sixth question reads:\n'If papers of evidential value only be seized under a search warrant and the party from whose house or office they are taken be indicted; if he then move before trial for the return of said papers and said motion is denied-is the court at trial bound in law to inquire as to the origin of or method of procuring said papers when they are offered in evidence against the party so indicted?'\n\n The papers being of 'evidential value only' and having been unlawfully seized, this question really is whether, it having been decided on a motion before trial that they should not be returned to the defendant, the trial court, when objection was made to their use on the trial, was bound to again inquire as to the unconstitutional origin of the possession of them. It is plain that the trial court acted upon the rule, widely adopted, that courts in criminal trials will not pause to determine how the possession of evidence tendered has been obtained. While this is a rule of great practical importance, yet, after all, it is only a rule of procedure and therefore it is not to be applied as a hard and fast formula to every case, regardless of its special circumstances. We think rather that it is a rule to be used to secure the ends of justice under the circumstances presented by each case, and where, in the progress of a trial, it becomes probable that there has been an unconstitutional seizure of papers, it is the duty of the trial court to entertain an objection to their admission or a motion for their exclusion and to consider \n\n[255 U.S. 298, 313]\n\u00a0\n and decide the question as then presented, even where a motion to return the papers may have been denied before trial. A rule of practice must not be allowed for any technical reason to prevail over a constitutional right.\n In the case we are considering the certificate shows that a motion to return the papers, seized under the search warrants, was made before the trial and was denied, and that on the trial of the case before another judge, this ruling was treated as conclusive, although, as we have seen, in the progress of the trial it must have become apparent that the papers had been unconstitutionally seized. The constitutional objection having been renewed, under the circumstances, the court should have inquired as to the origin of the possession of the papers when they were offered in evidence against the defendant.\n Each question is answered, Yes. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALLANAN v.

C., for plaintiff.\n Messrs. F. H. Stephens and Robert L. Williams, both of Washington, D. C., for the District of Columbia.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, has certified the following question (Judicial Code,  251 [Comp. St.  1228]):\n'Is the sprinkling of the streets to keep down dust for the purpose of the comfort and health of the general public, a public or governmental act as contradistinguished from a private or municipal act, which exempts the District of Columbia from liability for the injuries caused by one of its employees engaged therein?' \n\n[256 U.S. 650, 652]\n\u00a0\n In order to prepare the streets of Washington for sweeping, it was the practice to sprinkle them from portable tanks. While filling one of these tanks through a hose connected to a water plug, a corporate employee negligently dropped the plug cover and injured Adelbert Harris, a young child. He brought suit against the District of Columbia for damages. db\n\n[256 U.S. 650, 1]\n\u00a0\n It is established doctrine that when acting in good faith municipal corporations are not liable for the manner in which they exercise discretionary powers of a public or legislative character. A different rule generally prevails as to their private or corporate powers. Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.)  1626 et seq., and cases cited.\n\n Application of these general principles to the facts of particular cases has occasioned much difficulty. The circumstances being stated, it is not always easy to determine what power a municipal corporation is exercising. But, nothing else appearing, we are of opinion that, when sweeping the streets, a municipality is exercising its discretionary powers to protect public health and comfort and is not performing a special corporate or municipal duty to keep them in repair. This conclusion, we think, accords with common observation, harmonizes with what has been declared heretofore concerning liability of the District of Columbia for torts, and is supported by well-considered cases.

Corporation of Washington, supra, the corporation was held liable for injuries resulting from an insecure bridge placed by the charter under its exclusive control and management. Among other things, through \n\n[256 U.S. 650, 653]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Clifford, this was said:\n'Municipal corporations undoubtedly are invested with certain powers, which, from their nature, are discretionary, such as the power to adopt regulations or by-laws for the management of their own affairs, or for the preservation of the public health, or to pass ordinances prescribing and regulating the duties of policemen and firemen, and for many other useful and important objects within the scope of their charters. Such powers are generally regarded as discretionary, because, in their nature, they are legislative; and although it is the duty of such corporations to carry out the powers so granted and make them beneficial, still it has never been held that an action on the case would lie against the corporation, at the suit of an individual, for the failure on their part to perform such a duty . ... Whether the action in this case is maintainable against the defendants or not, depends upon the terms and conditions of their charter, as is obvious from the views already advanced.'\n\n Barnes v. District of Columbia, supra, presented a case of injury arising from a defective street. The District was held liable and, for the court Mr. Justice Hunt said, concerning the point presently important:\n'Some cases hold that the adoption of a plan of such a work is a judicial act; and, if injury arises from the mere execution of that plan, no liability exists. Child v. City of Boston, 4 Allen, 41; Thayer v. Boston, 19 Pick. 511. Other cases hold that for its negligent execution of a plan good in itself, or for mere negligence in the care of its streets or other works, a municipal corporation cannot be charged. City of Detroit v. Blackely, 21 Mich. 84, is of the latter class, where it was held that the city was not liable for an injury arising from its neglect to keep its sidewalks in repair.\n\n'The authorities establishing the contrary doctrine that a city is responsible for its mere negligence, are so \n\n[256 U.S. 650, 654]\n\u00a0\n numerous and so well considered, that the law must be deemed to be settled in accordance with them' (citing many cases).\n\n District of Columbia v.

CO. v. BLINCOE(1921)\nNo. 161\nArgued: January 20, 1921Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick W. Lehmann and James C. Jones, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles E. Morrow, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is the second writ of error in this case. The opinion upon the first writ is reported in \n245 U.S. 146\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 54. The suit here is, as it was there, upon a certificate of qualified life insurance, issued to Frank Barber and payable at his death to his wife, the plaintiff, who has since died, and her administratrix has been substituted as defendant in error.\n The defense here is, as it was there, that Barber failed to pay the mortuary assessment levied January 29, 1910, known as quarterly call No. 126, and that the failure voided the policy by its terms.\n In that case Mrs. Barber recovered judgment, which we reversed on the ground that in rendering it the state court disregarded a judgment of a Connecticut court which had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, including Barber.\n Upon the return of the case to the state court a new \n\n[255 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n trial was had, that resulted again in a verdict and judgment for Mrs. Barber. They were affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. Barber v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 279 Mo. 318, 214 S. W. 207.\n To that affirmance this writ of error is directed, and the question presented is: Did the Supreme Court proceed in consonance with our decision? The extent of our decision is therefore necessary to consider, and what it directed. The determination is in the issue that was presented and passed upon.\n By reference to the report of the case (\n245 U.S. 146\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 54) it will be seen that the Supreme Court rested the judgment reviewed on the invalidity of the assessment and that the nonpayment of the latter did not, upon two grounds, work a forfeiture of the insurance: ( 1) Under the condition of the funds of the company the assessment was for a larger amount than was necessary to pay death losses; (2) the charter of the company required all its affairs to be managed and controlled by a board of not less than seven directors, and that the assessment was not levied by the board. These rulings we held to be 'in the teeth of the Connecticut adjudication, which held that it was proper and reasonable for the company to hold and even collect in advance, in order to enable it to pay losses properly.' It was hence decided that the trial court in rendering judgment against the Hartford Company, and the Supreme Court in affirming the judgment, did not give 'full faith and credit to the Connecticut record.' The reasons for the conclusion we need not repeat.\n With this ruling the Supreme Court was confronted upon its reconsideration of the case and the freedom of decision that remained to it, and resolved that we had left untouched any consideration of the elements constituting the assessment, and that it was at liberty to decide, and decided, that a tax, asserted by the company to have been imposed by the laws of Missouri, had been \n\n[255 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n unlawfully included in the assessment and that, therefore, the assessment was void and its nonpayment did not work a forfeiture of Barber's insurance. To the contention of the company that such holding was precluded by our opinion, it was replied that the matter presented purely a question arising under the laws of the state and that this court 'did not intend by its judgment to adjudicate to the contrary.'\n The decision of the court that the Hartford Company was not subject to the tax that it had included in its assessment was not new. It was a repetition of the ruling made in Northwestern Masonic Aid Association v. Waddill, 138 Mo. 628, 40 S. W. 648, in 1897, and should have been known to the Hartford Life Insurance Company at the time it made the assessment and mortuary call. The ruling has been again repeated in Young v. Hartford Co., 277 Mo. 694, 211 S. W. 1, and upon the authority of those cases the court decided that the tax was not applicable to companies doing business on the assessment plan, and that on that plan the Hartford Company was doing business.\n The Hartford Company contests the latter ruling, and as dependent upon it, the other ruling, that is, that the company was not subject to the tax, and asserts besides that the effect of the inclusion of the tax in the assessment was presented to this court on the former writ of error and whether it was authorized by the Connecticut decree, and that the answers were in the affirmative; in other words, passed upon the power to make and the elements that made the assessment. Counsel say:\n'This court could not have held that this assessment was authorized by the Connecticut decree and at the same time hold that it was void because it included the 15 cents tax.'\n\n To sustain this view of the case the opinion is quoted as follows:\n'It is obvious from the evidence that this assessment was levied in the usual way adopted by \n\n[255 U.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n the company and tacitly sanctioned by the Connecticut judgment.'\n\n Counsel, however, admits that the question of the inclusion of the tax was not discussed, but insists that 'the question was in the record, was necessarily involved, and was presented,' and invokes the presumption that whatever was within the issue was decided; in other words, that the case was conclusive, not only of all that was decided, but of all that might have been decided.\n From our statement of the issues it is manifest that the quotation from the opinion has other explanation than counsel's, and we need not dwell upon the presumption invoked or the extent of its application in a proper case. The question of the effect of a judgment as a bar or estoppel against the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim or demand, or its effect upon a particular issue or question in some other case is not here involved. The most that can be said of any question that was decided is that it became the law of the case and as such binding on the Supreme Court of the state, and to what extent binding is explained in Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 U.S. 436\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 739. Certainly omissions do not constitute a part of a decision and become the law of the case, nor does a contention of counsel not responded to. The element of taxes in the assessment was not considered by the Supreme Court and in this court the Connecticut judgment and its effect were the prominent and determining factors. The question of the inclusion of the tax was not discussed or even referred to. The only question considered was the powers given to the directors of the company by the Connecticut charter and the effect that was to be assigned to the Connecticut judgment as that of a court having jurisdiction to decide what powers the charter conferred or required. It is hardly necessary to say that the tax law of Missouri was no part of the \n\n[255 U.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n charter. It was a condition the company encountered and became subject to in Missouri.\n It was urged, it is true, in the brief of counsel that the assessment 'was void because it included money for taxes erroneously claimed to be enacted [exacted] under the laws of Missouri.' No notice, however, was taken of the contention and no influence given to it or to the effect it asserted. If it made any impression at all it was obviously as a state question dependent upon the state statutes upon which we would naturally not anticipate the state courts, the case necessarily going back to them.\n Nor may we judge of the action of the Supreme Court of the state upon the tax because of its size, nor yield to the contention of the company that it, the company, had not accepted the assessment plan of insurance, but was doing business on the premium plan, and therefore subject to the tax which it had included in the assessment. These are state questions and are not within our power to review.\n It is further contended by the Hartford Company that the Supreme Court permitted the recovery of damages and attorney's fees under the provisions of a statute of the state, although there was no evidence in support thereof, except the delay in payment of the claim for insurance, notwithstanding, it is further said, the company 'had prevailed on every issue that had theretofore been presented,' and that by this action the company was deprived of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n In support of its contention the company cites section 7068 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri 1909, which, it is said, authorizes such recovery only 'if it appear from the evidence that such company [insurance company] has vexatiously refused to pay' loss under a policy, and no evidence was offered on either trial to show the existence of the condition prescribed by the statute. The immediate \n\n[255 U.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n answer to the contention is that what the statute prescribed was for the courts of the state to determine and their construction is not open to our review though we might consider its application to the circumstances of the case to be rather hard. And it would, we think, be extreme to hold that the statute or its construction is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEITMULLER v.

C. Stokes claimed to be the purchaser of the premises, and the action was brought against Anna Heitmuller as tenant thereof. Trial was had in the municipal court, and judgment rendered in favor of the defendant. Stokes appealed to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and filed an affidavit after the docketing of the appeal as required by rule 19 of that court. Defendant filed an affidavit setting forth grounds of defense. The Supreme Court entered judgment for the plaintiff, Stokes, upon the ground that the defense as set forth by the defendant was insufficient to defeat the plaintiff's recovery. The case was taken to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, where the judgment of the Supreme Court was affirmed. 49 App. D. C. 391, 266 Fed. 1011. A writ of error brings the case to this court.\n The errors assigned raise constitutional questions as to the validity of the so-called Saulsbury Resolution (40 Stat. 593), and of rule 19 of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Other errors, not necessary to notice, are also assigned. \n\n[256 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District, affirming that of the Supreme Court, was rendered on January 5, 1920, and on January 15, 1920, a writ of error was allowed bringing the case to this court. On February 5, 1920, Stokes, appellee in the Court of Appeals, and defendant in error here, filed a motion to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground that he had sold and conveyed the real estate, the possession of which was the subject-matter in dispute, and had no further interest in the cause, except to recover costs and rental due because of the wrongful detention of the property, and upon the further ground that no appeal bond had been filed by the appellant. The Court of Appeals denied the motion. After the allowance of the writ of error, the cause had passed beyond the jurisdiction of that court.\n In this court the defendant in error, Stokes, moves to dismiss the writ of error, setting forth as grounds for the motion:\n\n 1. \nThe cause of action between the parties hereto has ceased to exist, for that after the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, appellee sold and conveyed the real estate, the subject- matter of this suit, and therefore is not now entitled to the relief herein sought, namely, the possession of said premises.\n\n 2. \nThere is now no actual controversy involving real and substantial rights between the parties to the record, and no subject-matter upon which the judgment of this court can operate.\n\n 3. \nThe only question now involved in this appeal, is that of costs.\n As the action was brought to recover the possession of real estate, and as the defendant in error has, pending review in this court, sold it, we agree with the contention that the case has become moot. The plaintiff in error, so far as the record discloses, is in possession, and, the defendant \n\n[256 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n in error having sold and conveyed the property, a judgment, if in his favor, will not give him possession of the premises. It has been often held that this court will not decide moot cases. The rule was stated in Mills v. Green, \n159 \nU.S. 651, 653\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 132, 133 (40 L. Ed. 293):\n'The duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it. It necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal. And such a fact, when not appearing on the record, may be proved by extrinsic evidence. Lord v. Veazie, 49 U. S. (8 How.) 251; California v. San Pablo & T. R. Co., \n149 U.S. 308\n.'\n\n See, also, United States v. Hamburg-American Co., \n239 U.S. 476\n, 36 Sup.

MASTORAS(1921)\nNo. 51\nArgued: October 21, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Dike, of Boston, Mass., and Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph L. Atkins, of Portland, Or., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit bringing here for review a decree of that court, reversing one of the District Court of Oregon, granting an injunction against infringement of a patent for a candy-pulling machine. The patent, No. 831,501, was issued to Hildreth as assignee by mesne assignments of Dickinson. Mastoras, the defendant in the District Court, made and used a candy-pulling machine, under a later patent of Langer. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the claim of the Dickinson patent sued on to be so limited as not to cover the Langer device. (D. C.) 253 Fed. 68; Mastoras v. Hildreth %(c. c. a.)\/ 263 Fed. 571.\n The chief question in this case is infringement, and that turns on the question whether Dickinson's invention is held to be a primary or generic invention, or a narrow one limited solely to the device shown.\n Not all candy is pulled, but much of it is. The process is first the mixture of the ingredients, then the boiling, \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n then the cooling on a slab, and then the pulling. After boiling and cooling, it is a compact mass of dark color. The pulling aerates it and makes it less in weight but larger in bulk, lighter in color and more capable of holding flavor. Until the beginning of this century, candy was pulled only by hand. It required much strength. Candy pullers were hard to get. The work was strenuous and produced perspiration and uncleanliness. It was done with the bare hands, and it was impossible to avoid danger from eczema and abrasions of the skin of the hands. It was neither appetizing nor sanitary. A good candy puller pull 300 pounds of candy a day. The capacity of the large machines now in use is 2 1\/2 tons each, and one man can attend to two machines. Thus since 1900, the art has advanced from a production of 300 pounds a day to 10,000 pounds, with the same labor.\n In April, 1900, Dickinson published an article in the trade journal, the Confectioner, describing a machine for pulling candy and offering it for sale. He advertised it quite largely. Hildreth ordered the Dickinson machine, tested it and rejected it as unsatisfactory. One of Hildreth's men, Thibodeau, having seen and worked on the Dickinson machine, made a machine which worked better. Hildreth filed an application for a patent for one device for pulling candy September 21, 1900. Thibodeau filed an application for another November 26, 1900, and an interference was declared between them. Thibodeau thereafter bought Dickinson's invention, and caused him to file an application for a patent November 5, 1901. Six applications were pending in the Patent Office at the same time, those of Dickinson, Hildreth, Jenner, Thibodeau, Robinson and Henry, and the Patent Office framed the issue between them in terms exactly those afterwards granted to Dickinson as the claim relied on in this case. \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n The controversy in the Patent Office lasted five years, was strenuously contested, and was carried to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. The controversy involved, among other issues, that of the operativeness of Dickinson's device, as does the present case in one of its phases. He had given a public test of his machine at Grand Rapids where he lived, in 1900, and had invited a number of witnesses. They were called before the Examiner to testify whether the machine had worked successfully, and the Examiner found from the great weight of evidence that it had. Hildreth was a witness in the District Court below on this issue. He was in the embarrassing situation of having fought, in the Patent Office, Dickinson's claim, which he was now supporting as his property. He testified that while Dickinson's machine was not a success commercially, he had found that by shortening it and speeding it up, in accord with a suggestion of Dickinson, he could and did make satisfactory candy. The record shows that the Judge in the District Court below had a working model before him which he refers to as demonstrating that the device is operative.\n Hildreth has been a candy manufacturer of Boston for many years, and since 1906 has made candy machines. In addition to his own patent, he has acquired by purchase all the other patents in interference with Dickinson. He acquired the Dickinson patent from Thibodeau before its issue, for $75, 000.\n By these new devices the art of candy making has been revolutionized. Some kinds of candy which if pulled at all had to be pulled when cold, could not be pulled by hand, because it required more than man strength; but they are now pulled by power machines. The production of candy has greatly increased, and 90 per cent. of all the pulled candy made is pulled by machine. Hildreth makes a half dozen different classes of machines which embody the devices of his own patent and others which he has \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n purchased, but none of the model of Dickinson's. Mastoras, the respondent here, was for some time a licensee of Hildreth until he made and used his present machine.\n In candy pulling by hand, the puller works the boiled candy, cooled but still warm and sticky, into a sausage-like piece two or three feet long, and weighing 20 or 25 punds, called a batch. He throws the middle of this over a hook fixed in the wall about the level of his chin. He pulls down the two ends, stretching the batch two or three times its length. Then he holds the ends together with one hand and with the other seizes the two strands about their middle and carries them over the hook, thus making a new bight of the folded or lapped strands over the hook, and shortening the lengths hanging from the hook, the ends of which are now brought together and pulled down again. This operation, repeated often, brings the candy into desired condition.\n In the Dickinson machine, the candy is placed in the bottom of a trough, in the center of which is an upright pin, referred to in the patent as the 'candy puller.' There are two other pins suspended over the pin at one phase of the operation passing trough from the ends of an arm or plate, which in turn is fixed to a support and made to rotate. By suitable contrivance, the support which carries the pins is made to move back and forth from end to end of the trough. At each end of the trough, the pins are made by the rotary motion of the plate to which they are suspended, to reverse their positions from one side of the trough to the other before beginning their movement in the opposite direction. In this way there is produced an in-and-out movement of the suspended pins relative to the stationary pin every time they reach and depart from the ends of the trough. This movement causes the 'batch' of the candy in the trough, attached itself to the movable pins, to be pulled by lapping on itself as the suspended pins pass and repass the fixed pin and as their positions are reversed. The change \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 32]\n\u00a0\n of the relative position of the three pins is such that in a complete cycle of operation of the machine one of the pins passes through the space between the other two, and then another of the pins passes through a space between the other two, and then the third between the other two, each between two others, and at another phase of the operation being one of the pair between which the third one is passing. Just as the hand pulling of the candy produced a bundle of parallel fibers between which were formed air cells rendering the mass porous, so the mechanism of Dickinson's machine secures the same result. It elongates the candy, folds it upon itself, again elongates the folded mass, again folds it upon itself and repeats the operation in order. So far as this record discloses no candy pulling has been successful which does not in some form by an arrangement of three or more pins show this in-and-out movement to pull and lap the candy, and no one had shown it prior to Dickinson.\n Dickinson's claim here sued on is as follows:\n'A candy-pulling machine comprising a plurality of oppositely disposed candy hooks or supports a candy puller, and means for producing a specified relative in-and-out motion of these parts for the purpose set forth.'\n\n This, as already said, is the claim which was framed in the Patent Office as the issue of the interference proceeding, and of which Dickinson was given priority over all. The presumption of priority and novelty which arises from the granting of a patent must have greatly increased weight when the claim of the inventor is subjected to such close and careful scrutiny under the stimulus of a heated contest.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the claim of Dickinson to be limited by a prior patent to Firchau for a cancy-working machine applied for in March, 1893, and issued \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 33]\n\u00a0\n December 19, 1893. The machine shown in the Firchau patent comprises two discs which are rotated in opposite directions. On each disc is a finger which projects into a drum, into which the candy is put. The pins pass each other twice during each revolution of the disc and move in concentric circles, but do not have the relative inand-out motion or Figure 8 movement of the Dickinson machine. With only two hooks there could be no lapping of the candy, because there was no third pin to re-engage the candy while it was held between the other two pins. The movement of the two pins in concentric circles might stretch it somewhat and stir it, but it would not pull it in the sense of the art. The Firchau device never, so far as appears in the record, made candy experimentally or otherwise. Indeed, no candy was commercially pulled by machine before or after the issuing of the Firchau patent in 1893 until the introduction of the Dickinson principle, nine or ten years later.\n Counsel for the respondent in seeking to narrow the construction of the broad claim of Dickinson rely on the circumstance that one of Dickinson's claims in the Patent Office was canceled on a reference to Firchau. The canceled claim of Dickinson was:\n'In a candy-pulling machine, in combination, a series of pins or pulling members, and automatically acting means for causing said members to feed the candy to each other and pull the same.'\n\n The Examiner evidently considered that the word 'series' might be held to cover a device with only two pins, as shown in the Firchau patent; though having in mind the essential elements of the Dickinson patent, it could hardly have borne such a construction. However that may be, as neither Firchau nor any one else has shown, with two pins only, the in-and- out movement in pulling candy, which is the fundamental element of the \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 34]\n\u00a0\n Dickinson invention, the cancellation does not seem to us important or to require a narrowing of Dickinson's claim for the described and indispensable co-operation of three or more pins to produce that movement.\n The Court of Appeals bases something of its conclusion in this case on the alleged inoperativeness of the Dickinson machine. As to this, we find no reason in the record for disturbing the finding of the District Judge, with the working model and the witnesses before him, supported as he is by the finding of the Patent Office and the District Court of Appeals on extended evidence on this very point before them. It is not necessary, in order to sustain a generic patent, to show that the device is a commercial success. The machine patented may be imperfect in its operation; but if it embodies the generic principle and works, that is, if it actually and mechanically performs, though only in a crude way, the important function by which it makes the substantial change claimed for it in the art, it is enough. Telephone Cases, \n126 \nU.S. 1, 535\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 778; Mergenthaler Linotype Co. v. Press Publishing Co. (C. C.) 57 Fed. 502, 505.\n The Patent Office treated the Dickinson invention as a primary or generic one. So did the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia ( Jenner v. Dickinson, 25 App. D. C. 316), Judge Rose of the District Court of Maryland (Hildreth v. Lauer [D. C.] 208 Fed. 1005), and the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit (Lauter v. Hildreth, 219 Fed. 753, 135 C. C. A. 451). In this view, after a consideration of the record, and for the reasons stated, we concur. The history of the art shows that Dickinson took the important but long delayed and therefore not obvious step from the pulling of candy by two hands guided by a human mind and will, to the performance of the same function by machine. The ultimate effect of this step with the mechanical or patentable improvements of his device was to make candy pulling more sanitary, to re \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 35]\n\u00a0\n duce its cost to one-tenth of what it had been before him, and to enlarge the field of the art. He was, therefore a pioneer.\n We come now to the question of infringement. In the Langer patent, applied for in 1916 and issued in 1917, which the alleged infringement embodies, there is a so-called 'floating puller,' which is carried through a course of travel corresponding in form to the Figure 8, and around fixed supporting pins arranged concentrically within the two circular portions of Figure 8. The candy is pulled by the floating puller and alternately carried thereby around the fixed supporting pins. Instead of having Dickinson's single stationary pin and two other pins which move relatively to it and to one another, the machine of the Langer patent has two stationary pins and a third one which moves relatively to both of them in an actual and rigid Figure 8.\n Taking the first claim of Dickinson's patent as it reads, one can trace every element of it in the Langer machine. We find there a plurality of oppositely-disposed candy hooks or supports. The candy puller is found in the movable pin of Langer, and a relative in-and-out motion in the pulling process is palpably present.\n Both Dickinson and Langer in their specifications characterize the path of the candy under the operation of the hooks as being along a course of travel corresponding in form to the Figure 8. The Circuit Court of Appeals found, however, that the in-and-out movement of the Langer patent was different from the in-and-out movement of the Dickinson patent, in that it was a true Figure 8 in the former, whereas in the Dickinson patent the candy follows a path of a series of V's and not a true Figure 8 path at all. We differ from the Court of Appeals in this view. The actual movement of the candy in the Langer patent, even though the movable pin follows a fixed path of Figure 8, forms a succession of V's closely resembling the V's \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 36]\n\u00a0\n of the Dickinson patent, so that in each the path of the eandy is better described as an in-and-out movement than as a Figure 8. The arrangement of the hooks by Langer is better than Dickinson's, but the principle of their operation is the same.\n The counsel for the respondent, however, urge that the trough, not shown in the alleged infringement, is a necessary element of Dickinson's claim, because without it the batch of candy could not be supported against gravity, and he suggests no alternative. Dickinson says in his specifications that he shows a trough for supporting the candy, but any suitable support may be used which has the capacity for supporting the candy while it is being operated upon. Two of the machines, the Jenner and the first Thibodeau, which were in interference in the Patent Office with Dickinson, had the pins set, not in an upright, but in a horizontal, position, and thus the candy in their machines needed no trough support, but rested on the pins themselves, and this Langer has adopted. Doubtless this was an improvement which was perhaps patentable, but none of the tribunals in the Patent Office proceedings deemed this to be more than an improved equivalent of the trough which did not take these machines out of the domination of the claim awarded to Dickinson. As the Dickinson patent is a generic patent, the doctrine of broad equivalents properly applies here. Morley Machine Co. v. Lancaster, \n129 \nU.S. 263, 273\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 299; Miller v. Eagle Manufacturing Co., \n151 \nU.S. 186, 207\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 310; Paper Bag Patent Case, \n210 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 748\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the issuing of the Langer patent, after the Dickinson patent, raised the presumption of a patentable difference between that patent and the Dickinson patent, and against infringement. It is not necessary for us, however, to discuss that question, for we think that whatever presumption against infringement may attach to the issuing of the second \n\n[257 U.S. 27, 37]\n\u00a0\n patent, if any, the evidence here is quite sufficient to overcome it.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHILL v.

Pelletier, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final order of the District Court discharging a writ of habeas corpus and remanding appellant to the custody of appellee for rendition to a representative of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, pursuant to a warrant issued by the Governor of New Jersey under section 5278, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St.  10126).\n Upon the hearing before the District Court on return of the habeas corpus, it appeared that a demand for appellant's apprehension and extradition to Massachusetts \n\n[255 U.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n had been made by the Governor of that commonwealth upon the Governor of New Jersey, accompanied with a copy of an indictment found by the grand jury of Suffolk county, certified as authentic by the Governor of Massachusetts, and an affidavit to the effect that appellant was in the commonwealth for some time previous to and at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, and afterwards fled therefrom.\n The following is a copy of the indictment (signatures omitted):\n'Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Suffolk, ss:\n\n'At the Superior Court Begun and Holden at the City of Boston, Within and for the County of Suffolk, for the Transaction of Criminal Business, on the First Monday of February, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Nineteen.\n\n'The jurors for the commonwealth of Massachusetts on their oath present that Charles K. Hogan and Luther R. Hanson, on the eighteenth day of August in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixteen, conspired together to steal the property, moneys, goods and chattels of the Market Trust Company, a banking corporation legally established and existing.'\n\n It appeared that since the month of May, 1915, appellant had resided continuously at East Orange, N. J.; but he admitted that in the summer of 1916-he said he could not remember the date-he visited Boston and spent some time in the company of Hanson, the alleged co-conspirator.\n It is objected that the indictment does not charge appellant with the commission of a crime in Massachusetts; but when it is read in the light of the laws of that commonwealth the difficulty disappears. Revised Laws of Massachusetts, c. 218,  20, reads thus:\n'The time and place of the commission of the crime need not be alleged unless it is an essential element of the crime. The allegation \n\n[255 U.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n of time in the caption shall, unless otherwise stated, be considered as an allegation that the act was committed before the finding of the indictment, after it became a crime, and within the period of limitations. The name of the county and court in the caption shall, unless otherwise stated, be considered as an allegation that the act was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. All allegations of the indictment shall, unless otherwise stated, be considered to refer to the same time and place.'\n\n Of course the courts of the United States will take notice of the laws of the demanding state, as the Governor of New Jersey was at liberty to do. Roberts v. Reilly, \n116 \nU.S. 80, 96\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 291.\n Were there any doubt of the sufficiency of the indictment, as a pleading, it would not be open to inquiry on habeas corpus. Munsey v. Clough, \n196 \nU.S. 364, 373\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 282.\n The suggestion that there is neither allegation nor proof of an overt act done by appellant in Massachusetts pursuant to the alleged conspiracy is without weight. By the law of Massachusetts, as by the common law, a conspiracy to commit a crime is itself a criminal offense, although no overt act be done in pursuance of it; such acts, however important as evidence of conspiracy or as matters of aggravation, not being of the essence of the offense, since there is no statute making criminality dependent upon the commission of an overt act. Commonwealth v. Judd, 2 Mass. 329, 337, 3 Am. Dec. 54; Commonwealth v. Tibbetts, 2 Mass. 536, 538; Commonwealth v. Warren, 6 Mass. 74; Commonwealth v. Hunt, 4 Metc. 111, 125, 38 Am. Dec. 346.\n Appellant being charged by authentic indictment with a criminal offense committed in Massachusetts on or about August 18, 1916, and having, by his own admission, been personally present there and in communication with the alleged co-conspirator at or about that time, and being afterwards found in the state of New Jersey, there \n\n[255 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n is adequate ground for his return as a fugitive from justice under section 5278, Rev. Stat. U. S., enacted to give effect to article 4,  2, of the Constitution. Whether in fact he was a fugitive from justice was for the determination of the Governor of New Jersey. The warrant of arrest issued in compliance with the demand of the Governor of Massachusetts shows that he found appellant to be a fugitive; and this conclusion must stand unless clearly overthrown, which appellant has not succeeded in doing. To be regarded as a fugitive from justice it is not necessary that one shall have left the state in which the crime is alleged to have been committed for the very purpose of avoiding prosecution, but simply that, having committed there an act which by the law of the state constitutes a crime, he afterwards has departed from its jurisdiction and when sought to be prosecuted is found within the territory of another state.

Minor, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Washington Gaslight Co.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by private consumers of gas to have two orders of the Public Utilities Commission that increase the rate for gas to private consumers declared void. The first order, No. 254, March 15, 1918, raised the rate from 75 cents per thousand feet to 90 cents. The second, No. 314, March 15, 1919, raised it to not exceeding 95 cents; the orders being made under the authority of the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 150 ,  8, 37 Stat. 938, 974, et seq., establishing the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia and fixing its powers. The bill and the appeal to this Court are said to be based upon paragraph 64, of section 8, 37 Stat. 988. It is alleged that the orders violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights because the rate to be charged to the United States and to the District remains the statutory rate of 70 cents, and to certain other takers still less, and that if the United States and District had paid 90 cents for the year 1918 the Gas Company would have received a return of about six per cent. It is said that the difference is an unlawful discrimination and that the plaintiffs are required to make up the loss incurred by furnishing the gas to the Government and the District at less than cost. The bill was dismissed by the Supreme Court for want of equity and because not filed within one hundred and twenty days after the entry of the order of March 15, 1918, as required by section 8, par. 65. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decree on the different ground that \n\n[255 U.S. 452, 454]\n\u00a0\n a formal complaint and hearing before the Commission were a condition of the right to sue in the courts. The provision in paragraph 67 for the transmission of any new evidence taken in the suit to the Commission for its further consideration, and other details, were thought to indicate that the suit was in the nature of an appeal.\n We are unable to agree with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. Assuming that the bill is based upon the statute the language of paragraph 64 is that any person interested and dissatisfied with any order fixing any rate may commence a proceeding in equity. We do not perceive any advantage in requiring a party to file a complaint asking the Commission to review a decision just reached by it after a public hearing, nor do we see such a requirement in the statute. On the other hand we see no requirement that the plaintiffs in equity should have appeared in the original hearing upon the rate. They are parties to the order equally whether they saw fit to argue the case to the Commission or not, and when they stand upon supposed constitutional rights there seems to be no necessity of raising the point until they get into Court. This suit is not for a revision of details but for a decree that the orders are void as matter of law. That by reason of their pecuniary interest the plaintiffs are persons interested within the statute, may be assumed for the purposes of decision. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 49\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 22; Same Case, F. H. Peavey & Co. v. Union Pacific R. Co. (C. C.) 176 Fed. 409, 416, 417. See Detroit & Mackinac Ry. Co. v. Michigan Ry. Commission, \n235 U.S. 402\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 126.\n On the merits however there is no doubt that the decree was right. We do not wish to belittle the claim of a taker of what for the time has become pretty nearly a necessity to equal treatment while gas is furnished to the public. But the notion that the Government cannot make it a condition of allowing the establishment of gas works that its needs and the needs of its instrument the District shall be \n\n[255 U.S. 452, 455]\n\u00a0\n satisfied at any price that it may fix strikes us as needing no answer. The plaintiffs are under no legal obligation to take gas nor is the Government bound to allow it to be furnished. If they choose to take it the plaintiffs must submit to such enhancement of price, if any, as is assignable to the Government's demands. We do not consider whether the Commission has power to raise the price to the excepted class because, even if it has, the plaintiffs have no right to require equality with the Government and they have no other ground upon which to found their supposed right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUNT v. U S(1921)\nNo. 38\nArgued: October 17, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 125, 126]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert Chester Travis, of New York City, and Burt E. Barlow and Abram R. Serven, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims in favor of the United States.\n On January 17, 1895, appellant's decedent, William Weighel, entered into a written contract with the United States for the transportation of mail on route No. 235,001, 'being covered regulation wagon mail messenger, transfer, and mail station service,' between designated points in the city of Chicago, Ill., for the term of four years, commencing on July 1, 1895\n\n\n On February 6, 1895, Ezra J. Travis contracted in writing with Weighel to perform the entire contract for somewhat less than the latter was to receive from the government. The postmaster at Chicago and the Postmaster General were advised of this subletting, and for the entire four years during which Travis performed the contract he was recognized by the Post Office Department as a subcontractor, performing Weighel's obligations under the contract. The full amount stipulated for in the contract was paid by the government, all payments being made to Weighel, who made settlement with Travis.\n At the time Weighel bid on the route no mail service was being performed by contractors in Chicago to and from street cars, and the advertisement of the Post Office Department for proposals did not mention such service, \n\n[257 U.S. 125, 127]\n\u00a0\n but, on the contrary, before he made his bid, Weighel was notified by the postmaster at Chicago, who was authorized by the Postmaster General to give information to bidders, that the successful bidder would not be required to perform such service.\n On November 14, 1895, about four months after Travis, as subcontractor, entered upon the performance of the contract, and again on May 12, 1896, and on February 27, 1897, and May 3, 1897, the Postmaster General issued orders requiring the contractor to perform specified mail service to and from street cars in Chicago. The government claimed that this new service was within the scope of Weighel's contract, but he claimed that it was not, and, performing it under protest, he notified the government that compensation therefor would be demanded. Travis performed all of the extra service for Weighel, and the Court of Claims found that he was obliged to employ twenty-four men, four double vans, and seven single wagons to perform the service which had previously been performed by four drivers and four single wagons, and that the reasonable value of the extra service imposed by the orders of the Postmaster General was $52, 327.60.\n This suit, brought by Weighel to recover the fair value of the extra service rendered, has since his death been prosecuted by his executor.\n The Court of Claims decided that, because Travis performed all of the extra service which was the subject of the suit, Weighel had no interest in the subject-matter of it, and dismissed the petition.\n We agree with the lower court that the contention of the government cannot be allowed that the extra service rendered was within the paragraph of the contract providing that the contractor is 'to perform all new or additional or changed covered regulation wagon mail messenger, transfer, and mail station service that the Postmaster General may order in the city of Chicago, Ill., \n\n[257 U.S. 125, 128]\n\u00a0\n during the contract term, without additional compensation.' This paragraph is in precisely the terms quoted and considered in United States v. Utah, Nevada & California Stage Co., \n199 U.S. 414\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 69, which on this point plainly rules the case before us and gives the appellant a right of action, unless it is defeated by the fact that Travis, instead of Weighel, performed the service.\n The finding of the Court of Claims is that, while the government had notice that Weighel had sublet his contract, and while in practice it recognized Travis as a subcontractor, yet no copy of the subcontract was filed with the Department, as is provided for in 22 Stat. c. 116, pp. 53, 54 (Comp. St.  7455), but that, on the contrary, Travis certified to the Postmaster General that he did not intend that 'the contract should be filed for recognition by the Department or as a lien against the pay of the contractor.' Thus, while the government accepted service from Travis, it consistently retained its contract relation with Weighel during the entire four years. Three of the four orders for the extra service were addressed to Weighel, and the second of the four, which was addressed to Travis, probably by inadvertence, contained, as each of the others did, a requirement that the 'contractor' should perform the service designated without additional pay, 'in accordance with the terms of his contract.' All payments were made to Weighel, an it was from him that the protest came against being required to perform the extra service, and the notice that extra pay would be demanded for it. While Travis was called a subcontractor, he was treated by all concerned throughout the entire transaction as if he were (and he seems to have so regarded himself) a mere agent, performing for Weighel. The government did not have, and did not by any implication recognize, any contractual relations whatever with Travis, and if he had failed in performing it would not have had any right of action against him, for the subletting of such a contract \n\n[257 U.S. 125, 129]\n\u00a0\n was forbidden by statute, except with the consent in writing of the Postmaster General, which was never given, 20 Stat. 62,  2 (Comp. St.  7452). Weighel was the only person legally bound to perform the original contract; it was from him that the government demanded the extra service, and under the facts found by the lower court the obligation to pay for that service was to him, whether he performed it personally or through another. The government accepted performance of the extra service by Travis precisely as it accepted performance by him of the obligation under the original contract and the law requires payment to Weighel for the former as much as it required the payment which was made to him for the latter.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHURLEY V COMMISSION OF FISHERIES OF VIRGINIA(1921)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs.

William A. Purrington, John M. Woolsey, and Frank J. McConnell, all of New York City, for petitioner.[ In re Hussein Lutfi Bey \n256 U.S. 616\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[256 U.S. 616, 618]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and a writ of mandamus. The circumstances leading up to the motion can be shortly stated. The Steamship Gul Djemal, new in the port of New York, was arrested and is being held under process issued against her in several suits in admiralty in the District Court for that district. She is a merchant ship and came from Constantinople to New York under a time charter party, for a purely commercial purpose, shortly before the suits were brought. The claims sought to be enforced in them amount to $80,585 and are for wharfage, fuel, supplies, and other necessaries furnished to the ship at Gibraltar in the course of her voyage and at New York after her arrival. Her master, Hussein Lutfi Bey, appearing specially in the suits, applied to have her released from arrest, and in support of his application alleged that she was owned, manned and operated by the Turkish or Ottoman government, that she therefore was not subject to the court's process, and that he, as the representative and agent of that government, was her true and lawful bailee and as such entitled to her immediate possession. The court declined to order her release, and in the petition now proffered the master seeks a writ of prohibition forbidding further proceedings in the suits and a writ of mandamus commanding that the order denying his application be vacated and another entered releasing the ship. The questions involved are, first, whether the ship of a foreign government which it uses and operates as a merchant vessel is, when within the waters of the United States, immune from process in suits such as have \n\n[256 U.S. 616, 619]\n\u00a0\n been described; and, secondly, whether such immunity properly can be claimed in respect of the ship of a government which has severed and not resumed diplomatic relations with the United States. Both questions are important and also new. Their proper solution is not plain but debatable. This is frankly recognized in the brief supporting the motion.\n Even in admiralty cases a writ of prohibition goes as a matter of right only where the absence of jurisdiction is plain. Where the jurisdiction is debatable the granting or refusal of the writ is discretionary. In re Muir, \n254 U.S. 522\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed. --.\n It is not plain that there is an absence of jurisdiction here, for the question is an open one and of uncertain solution. On application to the State Department, it declined to ask the Attorney General to present to the District Court a suggestion avowing that the ship belonged to the Turkish or Ottoman government and was immune from seizure. We regard the situation as one in which to refuse the writ would be a proper exercise of discretion. There are stronger reasons against granting a writ of mandamus.\n Leave to file petition denied. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE LINCOLN GAS & ELECTRIC LIGHT CO(1921)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: October 24, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 6, 7]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert A. Brown, of St. Joseph, Mo., Maxwell V. Beghtol, of Lincoln, Neb., Charles A. Frueauff, of New York City, and Wade H. Ellis, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner asks a rehearing of this matter and a reconsideration of our decision of June 1, 1921 (\n256 U.S. 512\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 558), by which we refused to award a mandamus requiring the judge of the District Court to refrain from exercising jurisdiction in the cause of Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Company v. City of Lincoln et al., after our disposal of the final decree on appeal, for the purpose of requiring restitution to gas consumers of amounts exacted by petitioner pending the suit in excess of the maximum rates permitted by the ordinance that was under attack therein.\n We have permitted the petition for rehearing to be filed and shall state briefly why it cannot be granted.\n In our opinion in the principal case delivered June 2, 1919 (\n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454, 458), while sustaining generally the decree of the District Court dated September 23, 1915, which dismissed the bill of complaint, we nevertheless said that the decree should be modified--\n'so as to permit complainant to make another application to the courts for relief against the operation of the ordinance hereafter, if it can show, as a result of its practical test of the dollar rate since May 1, 1915, or upon evidence respecting values, costs of operation, and the current rates of return upon capital as they stand at the time of bringing suit and are likely to continue thereafter, that the rate ordinance is confiscatory in its effect under the new conditions.'\n\n To that end we modified the decree so that the dismissal of the bill as to the rate ordinance should be 'without prejudice to the commencement of a new action to restrain the enforcement of said ordinance hereafter,' and affirmed it as thus modified. \n\n[257 U.S. 6, 8]\n\u00a0\n Upon the going down of the mandate the District Court on January 6, 1920, entered an order modifying its decree of September 23, 1915, as required, and retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of requiring the petitioner to make refund and restitution to consumers of gas for amounts collected over and above the legal rate pending the litigation; and against this order relief was sought through mandamus.\n In the opinion refusing a mandamus, in response to the contention that the jurisdiction of the District Court to require restitution did not extend to overcharges subsequent to September 23, 1915, we stated that the decree of that date was conclusive evidence that petitioner had failed in the attempt to prove the ordinance rate noncompensatory, and hence that it not only was lawful and binding, but would so continue unless and until the petitioner, under the leave reserved, should begin a new suit and maintain its contention that the rate, through changed conditions, had become noncompensatory. It is now urged that this was based upon the assumption that no suit had been instituted attacking the rate since our decision of the appeal in the main case; and petitioner sets up, as the principal ground for asking a rehearing, that on January, 6, 1920, a new suit was brought by it in the same court against the city and its officials for the purpose, as stated, of taking advantage of the permission granted in the mandate following our decision of June 2, 1919\n\n\n Petitioner exhibits a copy of its petition in the new suit, which is in the nature of a bill in equity; also a copy of a restraining order granted by the District Court thereon.\n In our opinion refusing the mandamus we did not mention the new suit, for the very good reason that it had not been brought to our attention; not being mentioned either in the petition for mandamus, in the return of the \n\n[257 U.S. 6, 9]\n\u00a0\n District Judge to our order to show cause, or in the briefs or arguments on either side.\n It hardly was to be expected that the commencement of a new suit asking for an injunction because of changed conditions would oust the court of its jurisdiction over proceedings ancillary to the suit theretofore terminated and having for their purpose the bringing to a conclusion of rights arising out of it; and it will easily be seen that it can have no such effect.\n Instead of addressing itself to the question whether the rate ordinance was confiscatory under the conditions existing at the time of bringing the suit and likely to continue thereafter, it is largely devoted to an attack upon the adequacy of the rate, and consequently upon the validity of the ordinance, from and after September 23, 1915: there being specific averments and prayers as to the period from that date to the commencement of the new suit, with only inferential reference to the operation of the ordinance rate thereafter.\n But the former suit was terminated not upon the making of the District Court's decree of September 23, 1915, nor upon the announcement of our decision affirming it on June 2, 1919, but upon the going down of the mandate, which, for reasons that do not appear, was delayed until January 5, 1920. Until that date the ordinance was established by the decision as the lawful and exclusive measure of the rates chargeable by petitioner for gas served to consumers, and the gauge by which its liability to make refund for overcharges exacted during suit was to be determined. The beginning of the new suit, and the granting of a restraining order therein, can properly have effect only with respect to the then future operation of the ordinance, and cannot affect the measure of recovery to be applied by the District Court in awarding restitution for the period covered by the former suit; much less its jurisdiction \n\n[257 U.S. 6, 10]\n\u00a0\n to award such restitution. See Minneapolis, etc., Ry. v. Merrick Co., \n254 U.S. 376\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 142.\n In truth the new suit, in so far as it may purport to bear at all upon the proceedings against which mandamus was sought, is not within the leave reserved in the 'without prejudice' provision, indeed is in the nature of a bill of review, although leave to file such a bill was asked of us pending appeal in the former suit and refused for reasons stated in \n250 U.S. 261\n-262, 39 Sup. Ct. 454. In any aspect, neither the pendency of the new suit, nor the granting of a restraining order therein, constitutes the least reason for granting the rehearing asked for.\n Other points are suggested, but they are without substance. The fact, if it be a fact as alleged, that the bond given in the former suit is not sufficient in amount to cover the aggregate overcharges collected by petitioner pendente lite in excess of the ordinance rate, manifestly raises no question about the jurisdiction of the District Court to award restitution.\n Rehearing denied. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE MATTHEW ADDY STEAMSHIP & COMMERCE CORPORATION(1921)\nNo. 30\nArgued: April 11, 1921Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. T. K. Schmuck, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edward R. Baird, Jr., and Gilbert R. Swink, both of Norfolk, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Coalmont Moshannon Coal Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, filed its petition in the circuit court of the city of Norfolk, Va., against the petitioner, Matthew Addy Steamship & Commerce Corporation, a Delaware company, for the recovery of damages for the alleged breach of a contract, and, under Virginia practice, garnisheed other defendants. In due time, and in proper form, the defendant, the petitioner herein, filed its petition for the removal of the case to the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia. Thereafter the plaintiff in the state court filed a motion to remand the case claiming that it was not removable for the reason that the plaintiff and the principal defendant \n\n[256 U.S. 417, 418]\n\u00a0\n were nonresidents of the Eastern District of Virginia. The District Court sustained this motion and ordered the case remanded to the state court.\n The petition in this proceeding prays that a writ of mandamus shall be issued, directing the District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, to vacate the order remanding the case, to redocket it in the District Court, and that it thereupon be heard and determined according to law. A rule to show cause was issued and the judge has filed his return, in which he asserts that the petition should be dismissed, for the reason that mandamus is not an appropriate remedy, because not permitted by the provisions of section 28 of the Judicial Code (Comp St.  1010), reading as follows:\n'Sec. 28. ... Whenever any case shall be removed from any state court into any District Court of the United States, and the District Court shall decide that the case was improperly removed, and order the same to be remanded to the state court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the District Court so remanding such cause shall be allowed.'\n\n This language of the Judicial Code first appeared in the Act of Congress of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. 552, c. 373), as re-enacted on August 3, 1888 (25 Stat. 433, c. 866), and it has continued unchanged, except by the substitution of the District for the Circuit Court.\n In 1890, in the case of In re Pennsylvania Co., Petitioner, \n137 U.S. 451\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 141, it was held that the power which this court had before the passage of the acts, supra, to afford a remedy by mandamus when a cause, removed from a state court was improperly remanded thereto, was taken away by these acts. Upon full consideration of the prior legislation, this court in the opinion in that case said of the language of the statute quoted (\n137 U.S. 454\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 142 [34 L. Ed. 738]):\n'In terms, it only abolishes appeals and writs of error, it is true, and does not mention writs of mandamus; and \n\n[256 U.S. 417, 419]\n\u00a0\n it is unquestionably a general rule, that the abrogation of one remedy does not affect another. But in this case, we think it was the intention of Congress to make the judgment of the Circuit Court remanding a cause to the state court final and conclusive. The general object of the act is to contract the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The abrogation of the writ of error and appeal would have had little effect in putting an end to the question of removal, if the writ of mandamus could still have been sued out in this court. It is true that the general supervisory power of this court over inferior jurisdictions is of great moment in a public point of view, and should not, upon light grounds, be deemed to be taken away in any case. Still, although the writ of mandamus is not mentioned in the section, yet the use of the words 'such remand shall be immediately carried into execution,' in addition to the prohibition of appeal and writ of error, is strongly indicative of an entent to suppress further prolongation of the controversy by whatever process. We are, therefore, of opinion that the act has the effect of taking away the remedy by mandamus as well as that of appeal and writ of error.'\n\n In Fisk v. Henarie, \n142 \nU.S. 459, 468\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 207, In re Pennsylvania Company, supra, was cited as authority for the declaration that 'review on writ of error, or appeal or by mandamus is taken away' by the statutes cited.\n In Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Fitzgerald, \n160 \nU.S. 556, 581\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 389, 395 (40 L.

Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 92, 98\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 264, 266 (42 L.

Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury, both of New York City, in behalf of the British Embassy, by leave.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 28, 1917, the Gleneden, a British steamship privately owned, and the Giuseppe Verdi, an Italian steamship similarly owned, came into collision in the Gulf of Lyons, both being seriously damaged. November 7, 1918, the British owner of the Gleneden commenced a suit in rem in admiralty against the Giuseppe Verdi in the District Court for the District of New Jersey to recover damages occasioned by the collision, and a few days later the Italian owner of the Giuseppe Verdi commenced a like suit against the Gleneden in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The libel in each suit attributed the collision entirely to negligence of servants and agents of the owner of the vessel libeled, it being alleged that she was in their charge at the time. When the suits were begun the vessels were within the waters of the United States and each was within the particular district where libeled.\n The proceedings in the suit against the Gleneden are of immediate concern. After process issued and the vessel was arrested, private counsel for the British Embassy in Washington, appearing as amici curiae, presented to the court a suggestion in writing to the effect that the process under which the vessel was arrested should be quashed and jurisdiction over her declined, because, as was alleged, 'the said vessel is an admiralty transport in the service of the British government by virtue of a requisition from the Lords Commissioners of the \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n Admiralty, and is engaged in the business of the British government, and under its exclusive direction and control and is under orders from the British Admiralty to sail from the port of New York on or about November 25, 1918, to carry a cargo of wheat belonging and consigned to the British government'; because the court 'should not exercise jurisdiction over a vessel in the service of a cobelligerent foreign government'; and because 'the British courts have refused to exercise jurisdiction over vessels in government service, whether of the British government or of allied governments, in the present war, and that by comity the courts of the United States should in like manner decline to exercise jurisdiction over vessels in the service of the British government.' An affidavit of the master of the vessel affirming the truth of much that was alleged accompanied the suggestion. The libelant, being cited to show cause why the suggestion should not be acceded to, responded by objecting that it was not presented through official channels of the United States and by denying that the facts were as alleged.\n A hearing on the suggestion was had in which the libelant and counsel for the British Embassy participated-the latter only as amici curiae-and at which the owner of the Gleneden was represented informally, without an appearance. In the course of the hearing counsel for the libelant called on the others to submit proof in support of the allegations in the suggestion, particularly to produce the ship's articles and other instruments bearing on the suggested public status of the vessel, and the present the master for examination; but both the counsel for the British Embassy and the representative of the owner refused to do any of these things and insisted that the court was bound on the mere assertion of the claim of immunity to quash the process and release the vessel. The libelant produced the libel in the suit against the Giuseppe Verdi, depositions given in that suit by the \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n master and other officers of the Gleneden, a certificate from the customs officers in New York showing the report and entry of the Gleneden on her arrival, and other evidence, all tending measurably to show that the vessel was operated by her owner under a charter party whereby the owner was to keep her properly manned, furnished and equipped, was to assume any liability arising from negligent navigation, and was to bear all loss, injury or damages arising from dangers of the sea including collision. 'On all the facts' thus put before it, the court found that 'the Gleneden was owned by and was still in the beneficial possession of the Gleneden Steamship Company, Limited, a private British corporation, who through its servants, was in the actual control of the steamer and of her navigation, but engaged in performing certain more or less public services for the British crown under a contractual arrangement amounting to the usual or government form of time charter party.' The court 'decided accordingly that the Gleneden was not a public ship in the sense that she was either a government agency or entitled to immunity,' and the suggestion was overruled and an order was entered to the effect that the vessel would be released only on the giving of a bond by the owner securing the claim in litigation or a bond to the marshal conditioned for the return of the vessel when that could be done consistently with the asserted needs of the British government.\n Afterwards, on November 29, 1918, the master, appearing specially for the interest of the owner and for the purpose of objecting to the arrest and detention of the vessel, interposed a special claim to the effect that the Gleneden Steamship Company, Limited, was the true and sole owner of the vessel and he as master was her true and lawful bailee; and also interposed therewith a peremptory exception to the jurisdiction of the court on the grounds taken in the suggestion on behalf of the British Embassy. This claim and exception concluded \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n with a prayer that the process be quashed and the vessel released. The exception was not set down for hearing and remains undisposed of. There was no appearance by either the owner or the master save as just stated; nor was there any appearance by the British government or by any representative of that government other than through the suggestion which counsel for the Embassy in Washington presented as amici curiae.\n After filing the special claim and exception, the master applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for writs of prohibition and mandamus preventing the District Court from exercising further jurisdiction and commanding it to undo what had been done; but the application was denied for reasons which need not be noticed now, 255 Fed. 24, 166 C. C. A. 352.\n A few days later an arrangement was effected whereby an acceptable surety company undertook to enter into and file a stipulation for value in the usual form and in a sum to be named by the libelant, not exceeding $ 450,000, unless on an intended application to this court for a writ of prohibition the vessel should be held immune from the process under which she was arrested and detained. Following that arrangement, on December 10, 1918, the District Court entered the following order:\n'On the annexed agreement for security, and consent of the proctors for the libelant herein, and the record herein it is\n\n'Ordered that in order to prevent further delay and expense, the steamship Gleneden be and she hereby is allowed to proceed on her voyage and leave the physical custody of the marshal of the Eastern district of New York, provided, however, that this order does not and shall not be deemed to constitute any withdrawal of quashing of the writ of arrest; and it is\n\n'Further ordered that all proceedings herein be stayed and special claimant's or libelant's time to file any other \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 531]\n\u00a0\n or further papers herein be extended to and including the 23d day of December, 1918, and in case application is made for a writ of prohibition to the Supreme Court on or before December 23, 1918, all proceedings herein be stayed and the time of the special claimant or of the libelant to file any other or further papers herein be extended until ten (10) days after the entry and service of an order or decree on the final decision of the United States Supreme Court on the said writ of prohibition.'\n\n The master thereupon asked leave of this court to file a petition for a writ of prohibition preventing the District Court from proceeding with the suit and from interfering with the Gleneden in any manner, and for a writ of mandamus directing that court to vacate the order made when the suggestion on behalf of the British Embassy was overruled and to enter an order releasing the vessel without requiring security; the grounds advanced in the petition being essentially a repetition of those embodied in the suggestion of counsel for the British Embassy. The requested leave was given, a rule to show cause was issued, a return was made by the District Judge, and counsel have been heard. Whether on the case thus made either of the writs should be granted is the matter to be decided.\n The principal question sought to be presented-whether the Gleneden is such a public vessel of the British government as to be exempt from arrest in a civil suit in rem in admiralty in a court of the United States-is one of obvious delicacy and importance. No decision by this court up to this time can be said to answer it. The nearest approach is in the case of The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116, where an armed ship of war, owned, manned and controlled by a foreign government at peace with the United States, was held to be so exempt. To apply the principle or doctrine of that decision to the Gleneden would be \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 532]\n\u00a0\n taking a long step, and the present posture of this litigation is such that we find no occasion to consider whether there is proper warrant for taking it.\n It is conceded that the Gleneden is not an armed ship of war, and that she is not owned by a foreign government, but by a private corporation. In a sense she may be temporarily in the service and under the control of the British government, but the nature and extent of that service and control are left in uncertainty by the proofs, although the facts evidently are susceptible of being definitely shown.\n Prima facie the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit and the vessel (The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355\n, 368-369, 5 Sup. Ct. 860), and to call that jurisdiction in question was to assume the burden of showing what was in the way of its existence or exertion. Merely to allege that the vessel was in the public service and under the control of the British government as an admiralty transport was not enough. These were matters which were not within the range of judicial notice and needed to be established in an appropriate way. They were not specially within the knowledge of the libelant, nor did it have any superior means of showing the real facts. Thus from every point of view it was incumbent on those who called the jurisdiction in question to produce whatever proof was needed to sustain their challenge.\n As of right the British Government was entitled to appear in the suit, to propound its claim to the vessel and to raise the jurisdictional question. The Sapphire, 11 Wall. 164, 167; The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat, 283, 353; Colombia v. Cauca Co., \n190 U.S. 524\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 704. Or, with its sanction, its accredited and recognized representative might have appeared and have taken the same steps in its interest. The Anne, 3 Wheat. 435, 445, 446. And, if there was objection to appearing as a suitor in a foreign court, it was open to that government to make the as serted \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 533]\n\u00a0\n public status and immunity of the vessel the subject of diplomatic representations to the end that, if that claim was recognized by the Executive Department of this government, it might be set forth and supported in an appropriate suggestion to the court by the Attorney General, or some law officer acting under his direction. The Cassius, 2 Dall. 365, Fed. Cas. No. 7,743; The Exchange, 7 Charch, 116; Id., 16 Fed. Cas. 85, No. 8786; The Pizarro, 19 Fed. Cas. 786, No. 11,199; The Constitution, L. R. 4 P. D. 39; The Parlement Belge, L. R. 4 P. D. 129; s. c. L. R. 5 P. D. 197.\n But none of these courses was followed. The suggestion on behalf of the British Embassy was presented by private counsel appearing as amici curiae, and not thorugh the usual official channels. This was a marked departure from what theretofore had been recognized as the correct practice (see cases last cited); and in our opinion the libelant's objection to it was well taken. The reasons underlying that practice are as applicable and cogent now as in the beginning, and are sufficiently indicated by observing that it makes for better international relations, conforms to diplomatic usage in other matters, accords to the Executive Department the respect rightly due to it, and tends to promote harmony of action and uniformity of decision. See United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 209\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 240. Of course, the suggestion as made could not be given the consideration and weight claimed for it.\n From all that has been said it is apparent that the status of the Gleneden, judged in the light of what was done and shown in the District Court, is at best doubtful and uncertain, both as matter of fact and in point of law. The jurisdiction of that court is correspondingly in doubt, for it turns on the status of the vessel. The suit is still in the interlocutory stage. The court may take up again the question of its jurisdiction. If it does, the inquiry may proceed on other lines and the facts may be brought out more fully than before. In addition, the question \n\n[254 U.S. 522, 534]\n\u00a0\n may be re-examined in regular course on an appeal from the final decree.\n The power of this court, under section 234 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1211) to issue writs of prohibition to the District Courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty, to prevent an unlawful assumption or exercise of jurisdiction, is not debatable. But this power, like others, is to be exerted in accordance with principles which are well settled. In some instances, as where the absence of jurisdiction is plain, the writ goes as a matter of right. Ex parte Phenix Insurance Co., \n118 \nU.S. 610, 626\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 25; Ex parte Indiana Transportation Co., \n244 U.S. 456\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 717. In others, as where the existence or absence of jurisdiction is in doubt, the granting or refusal of the writ is discretionary. In re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 485\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 453; In re New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co., \n155 \nU.S. 523, 531\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 183; In re Alix, \n166 U.S. 136\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 522. And see Ex parte Gordon, \n104 \nU.S. 515, 518\n, 519 S.; The Charkieh, L. R. 8 Q. B. 197.\n Here the most that can be said against the District Court's jurisdiction is that it is in doubt; and in other respects the situation is such that we deem it a proper exercise of discretion to refuse the writ. Nothing need be added to show that the request for a writ of mandamus is on no better footing. In re Morrison, \n147 \nU.S. 14, 26\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 246; Ex parte Oklahoma, \n220 \nU.S. 191, 209\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 426; Ex parte Roe, \n234 U.S. 70\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 722\n\n\n Rule discharged and petition dismissed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE NATIONAL PARK BANK OF NEW YORK(1921)\nNo. 28\nArgued: March 15, 1921Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Edwin v. Guinan, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Park Bank of New York filed in this court a petition for a writ of mandamus directed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. A rule to show cause was granted, 41 Sup. Ct. 317, and the case is now here on the petition and the return. \n\n[256 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n In order to satisfy a judgment against the Reid Cattle Company the bank brought suit against it and the city of Fort Worth, in the federal court for the Northern District of Texas, to have certain lands to which the city held title declared property of the company and subject to the payment of its debts. The lands comprised about 30,000 acres and had been deeded to the city by Baldridge. He had received conveyances of all the lands, except one 640-acre tract, either directly or indirectly from the company; and it was alleged that all the lands, including that tract, had been conveyed to him either in trust for the company or in fraud of its creditors. The District Court, finding that all the lands had been held in trust for the company, and that the city was not a purchaser for value without notice, decreed that all the lands be subjected to payment of the company's debts. Upon appeal by the city the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the lands had not been conveyed in trust for the company; but it affirmed the decree in part and reversed it in part. 261 Fed. 817. The decree was affirmed so far as it related to lands conveyed by the company by deed of August 25, 1914, on the ground that such conveyance was in fraud of creditors. The decree was reversed so far as it related to lands conveyed by deed of the company dated December 7, 1911, on the ground that this conveyance left the company solvent. The opinion and the decree omitted to make specific reference to the 640-acre tract, the legal title to which had never been in the company, but had stood in the name of Davidson and had been conveyed to Baldridge by deed of October 13, 1913\n\n\n The decision of the Court of Appeals was rendered December 2, 1919. A motion for a rehearing of the whole case was made, and it contained, among other contentions, a slight reference to the failure to dispose of the Davidson tract. That motion was overruled January 13, 1920. No attempt was made to stay the mandate which issued \n\n[256 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n in due course, and was filed in the District Court February 2, 1920. The term of the Circuit Court of Appeals did not end until September 1, 1920, but no further application of any kind was made during that term of court. In November, 1920, after the city filed in the District Court a motion for judgment on the mandate, the bank applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to file a motion in which it called attention to the failure to pass specifically upon the claim to the Davidson tract, and contended that the decree entered at the preceding term was, for that reason, not final and should be modified. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied leave to file the motion, and this petition for a writ of mandamus was then brought to require the Circuit Court of Appeals to enter a final judgment disposing of the Davidson tract.\n It is clear that the rule granted must be discharged. The decree entered by the Circuit Court of Appeals was, in the light of its opinion, a final one, and disposed of all the issues before it. That court was powerless to modify the decree after the expiration of the term at which it was entered. If the omission in the decree had been adequately called to the court's attention during the term it would doubtless have corrected the error complained of, or relief might have been sought in this court by a petition for a writ of certiorari. The bank failed to avail itself of remedies open to it. A petition for writ of mandamus will not be granted under such circumstances. In re D. H. Riddle, \n255 U.S. 450\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 370, 65 L. Ed. --, decided March 21, 1921.\n Rule discharged.\n Petition dismissed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE NEW YORK(1921)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 490, 491]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward G. Griffin, of Albany, N. Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Ellis H. Gidley, of Buffalo, N. Y., for respondent.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three separate libels in rem were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n York-two against the steam tug Charlotte, her engines, boilers, machinery, etc., by one Dolloff and one Wagner, respectively, both residents and presumably citizens of the state of New York, to severally recover for damages alleged to have been caused to certain canal boats owned by them while navigated upon the Erie Canal in tow of the Charlotte; the other against the steam tug Henry Koerber, Jr., her boilers, engines, tackle, etc., by Murray Transportation Company, a corporation of the state of New York, bailee of a certain coal barge, to recover damages alleged to have been received by the barge while navigated upon the Erie Canal in tow of the Koerber. In each case the tug was claimed by Frank F. Fix and Charles Fix, partners in business under the name of Fix Bros., of Buffalo, N. Y., and released from arrest on the filing of satisfactory stipulations. Claimants filed answers to the several libels, and at the same time filed petitions under admiralty rule 59, 29 Sup. Ct. xxii (new rule 56, 40 Sup. Ct. xxi), setting up in each case that at the time of the respective disasters and damage complained of the tugs were under charter by claimants to Edward S. Walsh, superintendent of public works of the state of New York, who had entered into such charter parties under authority reposed in him by an act of the Legislature of the state of New York, being chapter 264 of the Laws of 1919, and had the tugs under his operation, control, and management; that if decrees should be ordered in the respective causes against the tugs the claimants, because of their ownership of the vessels, would be called upon for payment, and thus would be mulcted in damages for the disasters, to which they were total strangers; and that by reason of these facts Edward S. Walsh, superintendent of public works of the state of New York, ought to be proceeded against in the same suits for such damages in accordance with the rule. The District Court, pursuant to the prayer of these petitions, caused monitions to be issued in all \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n three cases against Edward S. Walsh, superintendent of public works, citing him to appear and answer, and in case he could not be found that 'the goods and chattels of the state of New York used and controlled by him' should be attached. The monitions were served upon Walsh within the jurisdiction of the court.\n The Attorney General of the state appeared in all three cases specially in behalf of the state and the people thereof, and of Walsh, and filed a suggestion that the court was without jurisdiction to proceed against Walsh, as superintendent of public works, for the reason that, as appeared upon the face of the proceedings, they were suits against the state of New York in which the state had not consented to be sued. The District Court denied motions to dismiss the monitions (The Henry Koerber, Jr. [D. C. N. Y.] 268 Fed. 561), whereupon the Attorney General, on behalf of the state and the people thereof, and of Walsh, as superintendent and individually, under leave granted, filed in this court a petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus. An order to show cause was issued, to which the District Judge made a return, and upon this and the proceedings in the District Court the matter has been argued.\n The record shows that the charters had expired according to their terms, and the tugs were in possession of the claimants, neither the state nor Walsh having any claim upon or interest in them. At no time has any res belonging to the state or to Walsh, or in which they claim any interest, been attached or brought under the jurisdiction of the District Court. Nor is any relief asked against Mr. Walsh individually; the proceedings against him being strictly in his capacity as a public officer.\n The power to issue writs of prohibition to the District Courts when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is specifically conferred upon this court by section 234, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 1087, 1156 [Comp. St.  1211]. And the fact that the objection to the jurisdiction of the court below might be raised by an appeal from the final decree is not in all cases a valid objection to the issuance of a prohibition at the outset, where a court of admiralty assumes to take cognizance of maters over which it has no lawful jurisdiction. In re Cooper, 143 U.  472, 495, 12 Sup. Ct. 453.\n That a state may not be sued without its consent is a fundamental rule of jurisprudence having so important a bearing upon the construction of the Constitution of the United States that it has become established by repeated decisions of this court that the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a state without consent given; not one brought by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of a foreign state, because of the Eleventh Amendment; and not even one brought by its own citizens, because of the fundamental rule of which the amendment is but an exemplification. Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529; Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, \n101 U.S. 337\n, 339. 25 L. Ed. 960; Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 U.S. 1\n, 10-17, 10 Sup. Ct. 504; North Carolina v. Temple, \n134 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 509; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 516, 524\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 269; Palmer v. Ohio, \n248 \nU.S. 32, 34\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 16; Duhne v. New Jersey, \n251 \nU.S. 311, 313\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 154.\n Nor is the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction exempt from the operation of the rule. It is true the amendment speaks only of suits in law or equity; but this is because, as was pointed out in Hans v. Louisiana, supra, the amendment was the outcome of a purpose to set aside the effect of the decision of this court in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, which happened to be a suit at law brought against the state by a citizen of another state, the decision turning upon the construction of that clause of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution establishing the judicial power in cases in law and equity between a state \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n and citizens of another state, from which it naturally came to pass that the language of the amendment was particularly phrased so as to reverse the construction adopted in that case. In Hans v. Louisiana, supra, \n134 U.S. 15\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 504, the court demonstrated the impropriety of construing the amendment so as to leave it open for citizens to sue their own state in the federal courts; and it seems to us equally clear that it cannot with propriety be construed to leave open a suit against a state in the admiralty jurisdiction by individuals, whether its own citizens or not.\n Among the authorities to which we are referred is Mr. Justice Story, who, in his commentaries on the Constitution (1st Ed.,  1683; 5th Ed.,  1689), stated that it had been doubted whether the amendment extended to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction where the proceeding was in rem and not in personam, and whose doubt was supported by a declaration proceeding from Mr. Justice Washington at the circuit. United States v. Bright (1809) Brightly, N. P 19, 25, note, 24 Fed. Cas. 1232, 1236, No. 14, 647, 3 Hall's L. J. 197, 225. But the doubt was based upon considerations that were set aside in the reasoning adopted by this court in Hans v. Louisiana. In Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 124, the question whether the Eleventh Amendment extended to proceedings in admiralty was alluded to, but found unnecessary to be decided, because, if it did not, the case was one for the original jurisdiction of this court and not of the District Court in which it was brought; and it was held, further, that the decree could not be sustained as a proceeding in rem, because the thing was not in possession of the District Court. Subsequently, in Ex parte Madrazzo, 7 Pet. 627, 632, an application was made to this court to entertain a suit in admiralty against the state of Georgia, and it was held that as there was no property in the custody of the court of admiralty, or brought within its jurisdiction and in the possession of any private person, \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n the case was not one for the exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction, and that, being a mere personal suit against a state to recover proceeds in its possession, it could not be entertained, since 'no private person has a right to commence an original suit in this court against a state.' Atkins v. Disintegrating Co., 18 Wall. 272, 300, et seq., and In re Louisville Underwriters, \n134 U.S. 488\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 587, are aside from the point, since they relate merely to a question of statutory construction-whether the provision of section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 79, c. 20, reenacted in section 739 of the Revised statutes, and in section 1 of Act March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470 [Comp. St.  1033]), to the effect that no civil suit should be brought against a person by original process in any district other than that of which he was an inhabitant or in which he should be found, applied to suits in personam in admiralty, so as to prevent the court from acquiring jurisdiction over a corporation through attachment of its goods or property in a district other than that of its residence (in the former case), or by service of process upon its appointed agent (in the latter).\n Much reliance is placed upon Workman v. New York City, \n179 U.S. 552\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 212. But that dealt with a question of the substantive law of admiralty, not the power to exercise jurisdiction over the person of defendant, and in the opinion the court was careful to distinguish between the immunity from jurisdiction attributable to a sovereign upon grounds of policy, and immunity from liability in a particular case. Thus at page 566 of 179 U. S., at page 217 of 21 Sup. Ct. ( 45 L. Ed. 314):\n'The contention is, although the corporation had general capacity to stand in judgment, and was therefore subject to the process of a court of admiralty, nevertheless the admiralty court would afford no redress against the city for the tort complained of, because under the local law,' etc. 'But the maritime law affords no justification for this contention, and no example is found in such law, where one who is subject to suit and amenable to process is allowed to escape liability \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 500]\n\u00a0\n for the commission of a maritime tort, upon the theory relied upon.'\n\n We repeat, the immunity of a state from suit in personam in the admiralty brought by a private person without its consent, is clear.\n As to what is to be deemed a suit against a state, the early suggestion that the inhibition might be confined to those in which the state was a party to the record (Osborn v. U. S. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 846, 850, 857) has long since been abandoned, and it is now established that the question is to be determined not by the mere names of the titular parties but by the essential nature and effect of the proceeding, as it appears from the entire record (Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 \nU.S. 711, 719\n, 720 S., 723, 727-728, 2 Sup. Ct. 128; Hagood v. Southern, \n117 U.S. 52\n, 67, et seq., 6 Sup. Ct. 608; In re Ayers, \n123 U.S. 443\n, 487-492, 8 Sup. Ct. 164; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 U.S. 1\n, 10, et seq., 11 Sup. Ct. 699; Smith v. Reeves, \n178 U.S. 436\n, 438-440, 20 Sup. Ct. 919; Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., \n213 U.S. 151\n, 168-170, 29 Sup. Ct. 458; Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, \n235 \nU.S. 461, 469\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 173).\n Thus examined, the decided cases have fallen into two principal classes, mentioned in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, \n140 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 608 (35 L. Ed. 363):\n'The first class is where the suit is brought against the officers of the state, as representing the state's action and liability, thus making it, though not a party to the record, the real party against which the judgment will so operate as to compel it to specifically perform its contracts [citing cases]. The other class is where a suit is brought against defendants who, claiming to act as officers of the state, and under the color of an unconstitutional statute, commit acts of wrong and injury to the rights and property of the plaintiff acquired under a contract with the state. Such suit ... is not, within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, an action against the state.'\n\n The first class, in just reason, is not confined to cases where the suit will operate so as to compel \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 501]\n\u00a0\n the state specifically to perform its contracts, but extends to such as will require it to make pecuniary satisfaction for any liability. Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436, 439\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 919\n\n\n As has been shown, the proceedings against which prohibition is here asked have no element of a proceeding in rem, and are in the nature of an action in personam against Mr. Walsh, not individually, but in his capacity as superintendent of public works of the state of New York. The office is established and its duties prescribed by the Constitution of the state. Article 5,  3. He is 'charged with the execution of all laws relating to the repair and navigation of the canals, and also of those relating to the construction and improvement of the canals,' with exceptions not material. By chapter 264 of the Laws of 1919, effective May 3, the superintendent is authorized to provide such facilities as in his judgment may be necessary for the towing of boats on the canals of the state, the towing service to be furnished under such rules and regulations as he shall adopt, and for that service he is authorized to impose and collect such fees as in his judgment may seem fair and reasonable; the moneys so collected to be deposited by him in the state treasury. For the carrying into effect of this act the sum of $200,000 was appropriated. Under these provisions of law Mr. Walsh, as superintendent of public works, chartered the tugs Henry Koerber, Jr., and Charlotte, in the name and behalf of the people of the state of New York, for periods beginning May 15 and ending at latest December 15, 1919, and it was under these charters that they were being operated when the disasters occurred upon which the libels are founded and the petitions under rule 59 are based. The decrees sought would affect Mr. Walsh in his official capacity, and not otherwise. They might be satisfied out of any property of the state of New York in his hands as superintendent of public works, or made a basis for charges upon the treasury of the state under \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 502]\n\u00a0\n section 46 of the Canal Law (Consol. Laws 1909, p. 264), which provides that the commissioners of the canal fund may allow claims for moneys paid by the superintendent of public works or other person or officer employed in the care, management, superintendence, and repair of the canals for a judgment recovered against them or any of them in any action instituted for an act done pursuant to the provisions of the canal law. In either case their effect, whether complete or not, would expend itself upon the people of the state of New York in their public and corporate capacity. Section 47 of the Canal Law provides for an action before the Court of Claims for certain kinds of damages arising from the use or management of the canals; but in terms it is provided that this 'shall not extend to claims arising from damages resulting from the navigation of the canals.' There is no suggestion that the superintendent was or is acting under color of an unconstitutional law, or otherwise than in the due course of his duty under the Constitution and laws of the state of New York. In the fullest sense, therefore, the proceedings are shown by the entire record to be in their nature and effect suits brought by individuals against the state of New York, and therefore-since no consent has been given-beyond the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 490, 6]\n\u00a0\n There is no substance in the contention that this result enables the state of New York to impose its local law upon the admiralty jurisdiction, to the detriment of the characteristic symmetry and uniformity of the rules of maritime law insisted upon in Workman v. New York City, \n179 U.S. 552\n, 557-560, 21 Sup. Ct. 212; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 215\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Union Fish Co. v.

The symmetry and harmony maintained in those cases consists in the uniform operation and effect of the characteristic principles and rules of the maritime law \n\n[256 U.S. 490, 503]\n\u00a0\n as a body of substantive law operative alike upon all who are subject to the jurisdiction of the admiralty, and binding upon other courts as well. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 382\n, 384 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 501. It is not inconsistent in principle to accord to the states, which enjoy the prerogatives of sovereignty to the extent of being exempt from litigation at the suit of individuals in all other judicial tribunals, a like exemption in the courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\n The want of authority in the District Court to entertain these proceedings in personam under rule 59 (now 56) brought by the claimants against Mr. Walsh as superintendent of public works of the state of New York is so clear, and the fact that the proceedings are in essence suits against the state without its consent is so evident, that instead of permitting them to run their slow course to final decree, with inevitably futile result, the writ of prohibition should be issued as prayed.

Griffin, of Albany, N. Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Irving W. Cole, of Buffalo, N. Y., for respondent.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In October, 1920, March J. McGahan and another, as administrators of Evelyn McGahan, deceased, filed a libel in admiralty in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of New York against the steam tug Queen City, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained through the death of deceased by drowning, due to the negligent operation of the Queen City upon the Erie Canal, in said district. The Attorney General of the state of New York appeared specially for the purpose of questioning the jurisdiction of the court, and filed a verified suggestion of the went of such jurisdiction over the Queen City, for the reason that at all times mentioned in the libel and at present she was the absolute property of the state of New York, in its possession and control, and employed in the public service of the state for governmental uses and purposes, and, at the times mentioned in the libel, was authorized by law to be employed only for the public and governmental uses and purposes of the state of New York; such purposes being the repair and maintenance of the improved Erie Canal, a public work owned and operated by the state, and particularly the towing of dredges, the carrying of material and workmen, the towing of barges and vessels containing material, and the setting, replacing, and removing of buoys and safety devices. He prayed that the vessel be declared immune from process and free from seizure and attachment, and \n\n[256 U.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n that the libel and all proceedings thereunder be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n The District Court overruled the suggestion and awarded process in rem, under which the Queen City was arrested. Thereupon the Attorney General, in behalf of the state, filed in this court, under leave granted, a petition for a writ of prohibition to require the District Court to desist from further exercise of jurisdiction and for a mandamus to require the entry of an order declaring the Queen City to be immune from arrest. An order to show cause was issued, to which the District Judge made return, embodying by reference the admiralty proceedings; and the matter was argued together with No. 25, original, Ex parte New York et al., Petitioners, \n256 U.S. 490\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 588, 65 L. Ed. --, just decided.\n To the suggestion that the Queen City is the property of the state of New York, in its possession and control and employed in its public governmental service, it is objected at the outset that the record and proceedings in the suit in admiralty do not disclose the identity of the owner of the vessel or that she was employed in the governmental service of the state. We deem it clear, however, that the verified suggestion presented by the Attorney General of that state, in his official capacity as representative of the state and the people thereof, amounts to an official certificate concerning a public matter presumably within his official knowledge, and that it ought to be accepted as sufficient evidence of the fact, at least in the absence of special challenge. The suggestion was overruled and denied, with costs, and process thereupon ordered to issue against the vessel, without any intimation that there was doubt about the facts stated in the suggestion, or opportunity given to verify them further. It would be an unwarranted aspersion upon the honor of a great state to treat facts thus solemnly certified by its chief law officer, and accepted as true when passed upon by the District Court, as now requiring \n\n[256 U.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n verification. In re Muir, Master of the Gleneden, \n254 U.S. 522\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed. --, decided January 17, 1921, differs widely, for there the suggestion that the vessel was exempt because of its ownership and character came not through official channels, but from private counsel appearing as amici curiae, who, on being challenged to submit proof in support of the allegations in the suggestion, refused to do so. Of course, there were other and more fundamental differences; but it is the one mentioned that especially concerns us upon the question of practice.\n Accepting, as we do, the facts stated in the suggestion of the Attorney General, the record-aside from whether a suit in admiralty brought by private parties through process in rem against property owned by a state is not in effect a suit against the state, barred by the general principle applied in Ex parte New York, No. 25, original-presents the question whether the proceeding can be based upon the seizure of property owned by a state and used and employed solely for its governmental uses and purposes.\n By the law of nations, a vessel of war owned by a friendly power and employed in its service will not be subjected to admiralty process; and this upon general grounds of comity and policy. Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch, 116, 144-147. In a case before Judge Francis Hopkinson in the admiralty court of Pennsylvania in 1781, on a plea to the jurisdiction, it was adjudged that marines enlisting on board a ship of war or vessel belonging to a sovereign independent state could not libel the ship for their wages. Moitez v. The South Carolina, Bee, 422, Fed. Cas. No. 9,697. The question whether by international law the rule of The Exchange is to be applied to other kinds of public vessels owned or controlled by friendly powers (see The Parlement Belge \n\n[256 U.S. 503, 1880]\n\u00a0\n L. R. 5 Prob. Div. 197), was stirred in In re Muir, supra, but found unnecessary to be decided. It does not now press for solution; for, aside from the obligations of inter- \n\n[256 U.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n national law, though upon priciples somewhat akin, it is uniformly held in this country that even in the case of municipal corporations, which are not endowed with prerogatives of sovereignty to the same extent as the states by which they are created, yet because they exercise the powers of government for local purposes, their property and revenue necessary for the exercise of those powers are to be considered as part of the machinery of government exempt from seizure and sale under process against the city. As Mr. Chief Justice Waite said, speaking for this court in Klein v. New Orleans, \n99 U.S. 149\n, 150:\n'To permit a creditor to seize and sell them to collect his debt would be to permit him in some degree to destroy the government itself.'\n\n The rule was applied in the admiralty by the same learned Chief Justice, sitting on appeal at the circuit, in The Fidelity, 16 Blatch. 569, Fed. Cas. No. 4,758, upon a well-considered opinion. To the same effect, The Seneca (1876) Fed. Cas. No. 12,668; Long v. The Tampico (1883, D. C.) 16 Fed. 491, 494; The Protector (1884, C.

C.) 145 Fed. 705, 706.\n The principle so uniformly held to exempt the property of municipal corporations employed for public and governmental purposes from seizure by admiralty process in rem applies with even greater force to exempt public property of a state used and employed for public and governmental purposes.\n Upon the facts shown, the Queen City is exempt, and the prohibition should be issued.\n Rule absolute for a writ of prohibition. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ. W. GOLDSMITH, JR., GRANT CO. v. U.S.(1921)\nNo. 214\nArgued: December 8, 1920Decided: January 17, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. L. C. Hopkins and C. T. Hopkins, both of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Adams, for the United States.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an act of Congress passed July 13, 1866 (now section 3450, Revised Statutes [Comp. St.  6352], and we shall so refer to it), it was enacted that:\n'Whenever any goods or commodities for or in respect whereof any tax is or shall be imposed, ... are removed, or are deposited or concealed in any place, with intent to defraud the United States of such tax, or any part thereof, all such goods or commodities, ... shall be forfeited; and in every such case all the casks, vessels, cases, or other packages whatsoever, containing, or which shall have contained, such goods or commodities, respectively, and every vessel, boat, cart, carriage, or other conveyance whatsoever, and all horses or other animals, and all things used in the removal or for the deposit or concealment thereof, respectively, shall be forfeited.'\n\n In pursuance of this enactment a libel was filed against a Hudson automobile of the appraised value of $800, and it charged that the automobile before its seizure was used by three persons who were named, in the removal and for the deposit and concealment of 58 gallons of distilled spirits upon which a tax was imposed by the United States, and had not been paid.\n Plaintiff in error, herein referred to as the Grant Company, was, on its petition, permitted to intervene and to give bond and replevy the automobile.\n The company subsequently answered, alleging the facts hereinafter mentioned, and in addition, pleaded against a condemnation and forfeiture of the car, the Constitution of the United States, especially article 5 of Amendments, which prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\n The case was to a jury upon an agreed statement of facts, which recited that: The Grant Company was a \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n seller of automobiles and was the owner in fee simple of the automobile used in this case, and sold it, retaining the title for unpaid purchase money, to J. G. Thompson (he was named in the libel), who was a taxicab operator, and W. M. Lamb, who was in the newspaper business; that the car was used by Thompson in violation of section 3450, R. S., but that such use was without the knowledge of the company or of any of its officers, nor did it or they have any notice or reason to suspect that it would be illegally used.\n The court charged the jury to render a verdict finding the car guilty overruling a motion of the Grant Company to direct a verdict for it on the grounds: (1) That section 3450, U. S. R. S., was in violation of article 5 of Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, in that it deprived the Grant Company of its property without due process of law. (2) That the section was not to be construed to forfeit the title of a third party entirely innocent of wrongdoing, and that the proper construction of the section was that it contemplated forfeiting only the interest or title of the wrongdoer. (3) That the title reserved by the company for the balance of the purchase money had never been divested, and therefore, could not be condemned, and that only the interest of Thompson and Lamb could be condemned.\n The jury found the car guilty and in pursuance of the verdict a judgment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, but as a bond with security had been given for the car, it was adjudged that the United States recover from the Grant Company as principal and J. W. Goldsmith, Jr ., as security, the principal sum of $800 and costs. Execution was awarded accordingly.\n Motion for a new trial was denied, and this writ of error was then prosecuted.\n This statement indicates the questions in the case and, as we have seen, involves the construction of section 3450 and \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n its unconstitutionality if it be not construed as contended by the Grant Company.\n If the case were the first of its kind, it and its apparent paradoxes might compel a lengthy discussion to harmonize the section with the accepted tests of human conduct. Its words taken literally forfeit property illicitly used though the owner of it did not participate in or have knowledge of the illicit use. There is strength, therefore, in the contention that if such be the inevitable meaning of the section, it seems to violate that justice which should be the foundation of the due process of law required by the Constitution. It is, hence, plausibly urged that such could not have been the intention of Congress; that Congress necessarily had in mind the facts and practices of the world and that in the conveniences of business and of life, property is often and sometimes necessarily put into the possession of another than its owner. And it follows, is the contention, that Congress only intended to condemn the interest the possessor of the property might have to punish his guilt, and not to forfeit the title of the owner who was without guilt.\n Regarded in this abstraction the argument is formidable, but there are other and militating considerations. Congress must have taken into account the necessities of the government, its revenues and policies, and was faced with the necessity of making provision against their violation or evasion and the ways and means of violation or evasion. In breaches of revenue provisions, some forms of property are facilities, and therefore it may be said, that Congress interposes the care and responsibility of their owners in aid of the prohibitions of the law and its punitive provisions, by ascribing to the property a certain personality, a power of complicity and guilt in the wrong. In such case there is some analogy to the law of deodand by which a personal chattel that was the immediate cause of the death of any reasonable creature was forfeited. \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n To the superstitious reason to which the rule was ascribed, Blackstone adds:\n'That such misfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner, and therefore, he is properly punishable by such forfeiture.'\n\n And he observed:\n'A like punishment is in like cases inflicted by the Mosaical law: 'If an ox gore a man that he die, the ox shall be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten.' And, among the Athenians, whatever was the cause of a man's death, by falling upon him, was exterminated or cast out of the dominions of the republic.'\n\n See, also, The Blackheath, \n195 \nU.S. 361, 366\n, 367 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 46; Liverpool, etc., Nav. Co. v. Brooklyn Terminal, \n251 \nU.S. 48, 53\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 66.\n But whether the reason for section 3450 be artificial or real, it is too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced. Dobbins Distillery v. United States, \n96 U.S. 395\n, is an example of the rulings we have before made. It cites and reviews prior cases, applying their doctrine and sustaining the constitutionality of such laws. It militates, therefore, against the view that section 3450 is not applicable to a property whose owner is without guilt. In other words, it is the ruling of that case, based on prior cases, that the thing is primarily considered the offender. And the principle and practice have examples in admiralty. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1.\n The same principle was declared in United States v. Stowell, \n133 U.S. 1\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 244. The following cases at circuit may also be referred to: United States v. Mincey, 254 Fed. 287, 165 C. C. A. 554 ( 1918); Logan v. United States, 260 Fed. 746, 171 C. C. A. 484(1919); United States v. One Saxon Automobile, 257 Fed. 251, 168 C. C. A. 335; United States v. 246 1\/2 Pounds of Tobacco (D. C.) 103 Fed. 791; United States v. 220 Patented Machines (D. C.) 99 Fed. 559.\n Counsel resists the reasoning and precedent of these cases in an argument of considerable length erected on the contention of the injustice of making an innocent man \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 512]\n\u00a0\n suffer for the acts of a guilty one, and the anxious solicitude a court must feel and exercise, and which, it is said, it has often expressed, and by which it has been impelled to declare laws unconstitutional that offend against reason and justice.\n The changes are rung on the contention, and illustrations are given of what is possible under the law if the contention be rejected. It is said that a Pullman sleeper can be forfeited if a bottle of illicit liquor be taken upon it by a passenger, and that an ocean steamer can be condemned to confiscation if a package of like liquor be innocently received and transported by it. Whether the indicated possibilities under the law are justified we are not called upon to consider. It has been in existence since 1866, and has not yet received such amplitude of application. When such application shall be made it will be time enough to pronounce upon it. And we also reserve opinion as to whether the section can be extended to property stolen from the owner or otherwise taken from him without his privity or consent.\n Counsel further urge that section 3450 should be read in connection with sections 3460 and 3461 (Comp. St.  6362, 6363), and other sections of the Revised Statutes, and should be construed to provide for the forfeiture of no interest for which those sections offer protection. We are, however, unable to concur with counsel that they modify the requirement or effect of section 3450. They have no relation to the latter section, nor is their remedy applicable to cases under that section.\n There is an intimation that in the prior cases there was something in the relation of the parties to the property or its uses from which it was possible to infer its destination to an illegal purpose; at any rate, the risk of such purpose and that such relation had influence in the decision of the cases.\n We are unable to accept the intimation. There may, indeed, be greater risk to the owner of property in one \n\n[254 U.S. 505, 513]\n\u00a0\n form or purpose of its bailment than in another, but wrong cannot be imputed to him by reason of the form or purpose. It is the illegal use that is the material consideration, it is that which works the forfeiture, the guilt or innocence of its owner being accidental. If we should regard simply the adaptability of a particular form of property to an illegal purpose, we should have to ascribe facility to an automobile as an aid to the violation of the law. It is a 'thing' that can be used in the removal of 'goods and commodities' and the law is explicit in its condemnation of such things.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents, \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJACKSON v.

C., for the amount of profits made by them and a former receiver of the association in the purchase at a foreclosure sale and subsequent resale of land mortgaged to secure a note owned by the association. The Supreme Court held them liable for the full amount of the profits, $743.68, with interest and costs. The Court of Appeals of the District reversed the decree and ordered that the bill be dismissed with costs. 48 App. D. C. 565. A writ of certiorari was granted by this court. \n250 U.S. 655\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 10. The question before \n\n[254 U.S. 586, 587]\n\u00a0\n us is whether the respondents are liable upon the following facts, and, if so, in what amount.\n In 1908 the Supreme Court of the District appointed William E. Ambrose, a member of its bar, receiver of the First Co-operative Building Association of Georgetown, D. C. Among the assets of the association so intrusted to the receiver was a note of Schwab for $2,700, secured by a mortgage deed of trust of land. The note being in default, Ambrose as receiver requested the trustee under the deed of trust to advertise the land for sale at public auction. The auction sale was held and a bid of $ 350 was made by Edwin L. Wilson, a member of the bar; but the trustee withdrew the property from sale because the bid was inadequate. Thereafter it was arranged between Wilson, Ambrose, and another lawyer, John Lewis Smith, who was counsel of the receiver, that the trustee should again advertise the property for sale; that Wilson should at the second sale use his own judgment whether to bid, and, if so, what amount; and that, if he should happen to bacome the purchaser, the three should be jointly liable for the purchase price and any expenses incident to the purchase and should be jointly interested in the property purchased. The second sale was duly advertised. Smith and Ambrose were present, but gave no instructions or directions in regard to the sale either to the trustee or to his auctioneer. Wilson also attended and in the exercise cise of his own judgment and without previous conference with either Smith or Ambrose bid $491 and became the purchaser of the property. There was no evidence of any improper influence at the sale to prevent competition or to close competitive bidding or to bring about the sale to Wilson in preference to any one else. On the contrary, it affirmatively appears that the sale was fairly conducted, that there was competitive bidding, and that the property was finally knocked down to the highest bidder.\n Within a few days after the second sale Wilson and \n\n[254 U.S. 586, 588]\n\u00a0\n Smith found, through the aid of real estate agents, a purchaser named Kite who was willing to pay $1,400 for the land. In order to convey a good title it was necessary to clear the land of tax liens and an outstanding tax title. This required $550-that is, $59 more than Wilson had bid. He voluntarily raised his bid by that amount. The land was conveyed by the trustee to Wilson and by Wilson to Kite, the deeds being recorded simultaneously when Kite paid the $1,400. Of this amount $652.32 was used to discharge taxes, tax liens and expenses of sale. The balance, $473.68 was divided equally between Wilson, Smith and Ambrose individually. Wilson had paid out in making the purchase no money of his own or theirs. The estate of which Ambrose was receiver got nothing, as the amount required to discharge the tax liens exceeded the amount bid by Wilson. Much later the facts were brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of the District. Ambrose resigned as receiver; Jackson was appointed in his stead, and as receiver brought this suit against Wilson and Smith to recover the profits which had been made by them and Ambrose.\n Ambrose, had, as receiver, the affirmative duty to endeavor to realize the largest possible amount from the Schwab note. Baker v. Schofield, \n243 U.S. 114\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 333; Robertson v. Chapman, \n152 \nU.S. 673, 681\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 741. To this end it was his duty to endeavor to have the land, when sold under the trust deed, bring the largest possible price. J. H. Lane & Co. v. Maple Cotton Mills, 232 Fed. 421, 146 C. C. A. 415. When he agreed with Smith and Wilson to join in the purchase if Wilson should become the successful bidder, he placed himself in a position in which his personal interests were, or might be, antagonistic to those of his trust. Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, 552. It became to his personal interest that the purchase should be made by Wilson for the lowest possible price. The course taken was one which a fiduciary could not legally pursue. Magruder v. Drury, \n\n[254 U.S. 586, 589]\n\u00a0\n \n235 \nU.S. 106, 119\n, 120 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 77. Since he did pursue it and profits resulted the law made him accountable to the trust estate for all the profits obtained by him and those who were associated with him in the matter, although the estate may not have been injured thereby. Magruder v. Drury, \n235 U.S. 106\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 77. And others who knowingly join a fiduciary in such an enterprise likewise become jointly and severally liable with him for such profits. Emery v. Parrott, 107 Mass. 95, 103; Zinc Carbonate Co. v. First National Bank, 103 Wis. 125, 134, 79 N. W. 229, 74 Am. St. Rep. 845; Lomita Land & Water Co. v. Robinson, 154 Cal. 36, 97 Pac. 10, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1106. Wilson and Smith are therefore jointly and severally liable for all profits resulting from the purchase; the former although he had no other relation to the estate; the latter, without regard to the fact that he was also counsel for the receiver.\n It is said that, at a sale made under a mortgage deed of trust, the duty to obtain the highest possible price rests not upon the note holder, but upon the trustee under the deed of trust, and that the creditor may bid at the sale or refrain from so doing, as he may see fit. Richard v. Holmes, 18 How. 143, 148; Smith v. Black, \n115 \nU.S. 308, 315\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 50. This is true so far as it concerns the duty of the note holder to the debtor or other owner of the mortgaged property. But the many cases cited to this effect in Smith's and Wilson's behalf do not bear upon the question before us.

Allen, for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, for the United States.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n In No. 32:\n Messrs. Frank S. Bright and H. Stanley Hinrichs, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Solicitor General, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Actions in the Court of Claims to recover respectively the sums of $ 35,000 and $170,000, alleged values of certain properties charged to have been taken and appropriated by the United States.\n Both appellants are corporations, and are respectively owners of lands in Churchill county, state of Nevada, surrounding and including lakes knows as Little Soda Lake and Big Soda Lake. The Horstmann Company is owner of the former and the Natron Soda Company is owner of the latter.\n In 1906 each appellant was manufacturing soda from the waters of the respective lakes, and the controversy of the cases turns upon the condition of the lakes at that time, and their condition after an irrigation project was instituted by the government, called the Truckee Carson project.\n The lakes are situated in an area known as the Carson Sink Valley, and in 1906 were the source of soda supply to the respective appellants.\n From prior to 1867 to 1906 the levels of the lakes had not varied more than 2 feet. In 1906 the United States Reclamation Service action under the authority of acts of Congress constructed the Truckee Carson project consisting \n\n[257 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n of dams, canals, and other structures whereby through the usual means large quantities of surface waters theretofore confined to the watershed of the Truckee river were in 1906 and during each year since then transported to the watershed of the Carson river and distributed to various and sundry tracts of land in the Carson River Valley for irrigation purposes.\n Details of the project need not be given, but with its advent the body of the ground water in the entire section covered by the project rose, and the volume of water in the lakes has continually increased, and the level of the lakes has arisen about 19 vertical feet during the period of 1906 to 1916, in consequence of which the value of the properties of appellants has been destroyed, that of the Horstmann Company being $9,000, and that of the Natron Company being $45,000, according to the findings of the Court of Claims.\n There have been additions to the canal project, and its ultimate development contemplates the reclamation of 206,000 acres of land. At present the canals of the project ramify an area of 100,000 acres.\n No negligence on the part of the United States is alleged or proven.\n The conclusion of the court was that appellants were not entitled to recover; hence it dismissed the actions and rendered judgments against appellants for costs of printing the records. Motions for new trials were made and denied.\n The question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims of the action is intimated, if not urged, based on the allegation in the petition of the Horstmann Company that, owing to the porous condition of the soil in the canals and ditches and 'the lack of proper lining in said canals and ditches, and owing to the way said canals and ditches were built and also to the natural condition existing,' the \n\n[257 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n water flowed into the lake and seeped and percolated through the canals and ditches. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The government is cautious in its characterization of this allegation and says that it 'apparently based the claim of the Horstmann Company upon a tort,' and adds, if the claim be so based, the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction, 'as the government has never waived its immunity from suit in such cases.'\n We do not think, however, that the allegation was intended as an accusation of negligence, but rather to forestall a defense, based on the character of the works, that from them there could be no causal connection between the project of the government and the rise of waters in the lakes. The Court of Claims besides explicity found that there was no negligence.\n Upon the merits, the contendion of the government is the absence of such causal connection between its works and the injury to the properties of appellants. It concedes, however, that the contention is a deduction from obscure findings; the court not finding affirmatively that a causal connection did not exist. 'Its decision was the Scotch verdict of 'not proved,\" to quote counsel. Appellants oppose the government's contention and deductions, oppose to them the difference in conditions before and after the execution of the canal project, and their reasoning seems to have the support of the methods that the world employs in the investigation of its phenomena and instances.\n Post hoc, therefore, propter hoc may not be confidently asserted, but there is a suggestion of effect and cause in it of sequence, something more than unrelated occurrence. And of this there seems to be pertinent application in the present case. The transfer of water from one \n\n[257 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n watershed to another-from the Truckee river watershed to the Carson river watershed-accompanied by an increase of the water in the lakes from a level not varied in 29 years more than 2 feet to 19 vertical feet, would seem to demonstrate this as an effect of the canal project. And there can be no doubt of the adequacy of the cause even though, to quote from the findings, 'percolating waters are hidden and invisible,' and 'it does not appear from the evidence how they are governed or how they move underground.' Their effects above ground, a rise of water in the lakes from 2 feet to 19 feet of water, are certainly visible and unmistakable. Indeed, the court explicitly found that with the advent of the irrigation project the body of ground water in the entire section covered by the project rose.\n However, we need not arbitrate and contentions, but will assume with appellants that there was causal connection between the work of the government and the rise of waters in the lakes and the consequent destruction of the properties of appellants, but it does not follow that the government is under obligation to pay therefor, as for the taking of the properties.\n The Court of Claims, as we have seen, decided against such obligation, and to its reasoning it would be difficult to add anything. The reasoning of the court is attacked, however, by appellants, and United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 455\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 349, is adduced against it.\n The instance of the cited case and a certain generality in its reasoning and basic principle gives plausible support to the contention. It is declared that the rule deducible from prior cases which are reviewed is that the appropriation of property by the government implies a contract to pay its value, and it is further declared that there need not be a physical taking, an absolute conversion of the property to the use of the public. It is clear from the authorities, it is said, that if by public works \n\n[257 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n the value of the property of an individual is substantially destroyed, its value is taken within the scope of the Fifth Amendment. And it was decided that--\n'The law will imply a promise to make the required compensation, where property to which the government asserts no title is taken, pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to be applied for public uses.' Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 130 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 56, 59 (63 L. Ed. 162).\n\n This generality has had exception in subsequent cases. It is to be remembered that to bind the government there must be implication of a contract to pay, but the circumstances may rebut that implication. In other words, what is done may be in the exercise of a right and the consequences only incidental, incurring no liability. Bedford v. United States, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 238; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 U.S. 46\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 655; Tempel v. United States, supra. And there is characterization of the Lynah Case in United States v. Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380.\n We think the cases at bar are within the latter decisions, and it would border on the extreme to say that the government intended a taking by that which no human knowledge could even predict. Any other conclusion would deter from useful enterprises on account of a dread of incurring unforeseen and immeasurable liability. This comment is of especial pertinence that the result of the government's work to the properties of plaintiffs could not have been foreseen or foretold is a necessary deduction from the findings of the Court of Claims. The court found that there is obscurity in the movement of percolating waters, and that there was no evidence to remove it in the present case, and necessarily there could not have been foresight of their destination nor purpose to appropriate the properties.\n In the Natron case the company's predecessors in interest conveyed a right of way to the United States of certain lands of the company, and prior to the conveyance \n\n[257 U.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n agreed with the United States that, in consideration of the benefits to be derived from the construction of the works through the lands conveyed, the United States might construct canals and ditches on and across the land, and further agreed 'that, in consideration of the premises, the first party hereby releases the second party from all claims for damages for entry, survey, or construction of said works.' The government adduces the agreement and conveyance in opposition of the right of the Natron Soda Company to recover. The company resists this effort. We, however, are not called upon to pass upon it. Independently of the agreement, the company's claim is to be rejected.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition of the Natron Soda Company directly alleges that the acts of the government were legally done in the exercise of a constitutional and legal power. \n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOURNAL & TRIBUNE CO. v. U S(1921)\nNo. 86\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 581, 582]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Frank Davis, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to recover moneys paid for the transportation of newspapers in the mails, upon the ground that they were paid under mistake of fact. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition. 53 Ct. Cl. 612.\n The facts are as follows: Claimant was engaged in publishing at Knoxville, Tenn., a daily morning newspaper having a circulation in Eastern Tennessee and adjacent parts of Virginia and North Carolina. It sent out a considerable part of its daily issue, destined for points on the United States postal route between Bristol and Chattanooga or on other postal routes connecting therewith, upon a Southern Railway train leaving Knoxville at 4 a. m. daily. The mail was dispatched in wagons from the main post office at Knoxville to the office of a mail transfer clerk at the railway station, the wagons being operated by persons having contracts for the purpose with the United States postal authorities. For claimant's convenience, the post office authorities consented that its newspapers might be weighed, for mailing, at the railway station instead of at the post office; claimant furnishing scales for the purpose. The mail wagons, under an arrangement between claimant and the contractor, called at claimant's place of business and carried the newspapers thence to the station. For this service claimant compensated the contractor or the driver. While this arrangement was in effect, and in the fall of the year 1906, claimant concluded to transport a part of the newspapers by express instead of mail, the express charges upon large lots being one-half the postal charge for transporting newspapers as second-class mail. It notified the express company of this purpose, and requested the express agent to be on the watch. Thereafter \n\n[254 U.S. 581, 583]\n\u00a0\n it caused certain copies of its newspaper intended for news dealers- theretofore sent by mail-to be wrapped in bundles and labeled 'Express or baggage,' with directions for throwing them off the train at the several destinations. Other copies of the paper, intended for subscribers and for news dealers, were placed, properly addressed, in mail sacks. The method of transporting the papers to the railway station continued as before, those intended to go by express and those contained in mail sacks being carried upon the same wagon and the driver instructed to take them to the railway station, which he did, depositing bundles and sacks on the platform where all mail was deposited. In the fall of 1906, and for about a year thereafter, the express company's office adjoined that of the mail transfer clerk, the doors of the two opening upon the same platform. Claimant's representative had notified the express company's agent of the purpose to send certain of the papers by express, and pursuant to that notice, until about October, 1908, a porter from the express agent's office went to the platform, took the bundles of newspapers labeled as mentioned, and caused them to be transported by express. During the same period the United States mail transfer clerk took the sacks of papers, ascertained the net weight, and caused them to be transported as second- class mail matter upon the same train. The net weight was reported to the postmaster, and he charged to claimant's account the proper second-class postage thereon. The system adopted was that claimant made a deposit with the postmaster to cover postage to accrue, and renewed the deposit from time to time as it was reduced by charges against it. During the year 1907 the express company's office was removed to a distance of about 150 yards from the transfer clerk's office, and about a year after this the express messenger or porter ceased calling at the mail platform for the bundles of papers labeled for transportation by express. Why he did so does \n\n[254 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n not definitely appear. Thereafter and down to March 31, 1913, claimant's newspapers, whether in sacks or in bundles, were alike treated as mail matter by the United States mail transfer clerk, who weighed them all and reported the net weights to the postmaster, and the bundles and sacks were transported to their respective destinations as second-class mail matter. The charge appropriate for such mail matter was regularly made against claimant's deposit and paid by claimant during the entire period. In the spring of 1913 claimant's business manager, having his attention called to the fact that the express bills were small, discovered upon investigation that the bundles of papers labeled 'Express' were being transported as second-class mail matter; and the present suit followed. During the period referred to approximately 358,442 pounds of newspapers were transported by the United States mail that were labeled 'Express' and had been intended by claimant to be transported by express. Claimant paid thereon the regular second-class mail matter rate of 1 cent per pound, aggregating $3, 584.42. The transportation of the same matter by express would have cost claimant $1,792.21.\n The government insists that this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, upon the ground that the amount in controversy is less than the $3,000 specified in the applicable provision, section 242 of the Judicial Code (Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157 [Comp. St.  1219]). It is said that, viewing the claim in the most favorable light, and assuming a mistake was made entitling claimant to recover, the amount recoverable could not exceed the difference between what was paid as postage and what would have been paid had the newspapers been sent by express; that is to say, $1,792.21. But, while in its original petition claimant prayed recovery for only the latter amount, in an amendment made by leave of the court it sought a return of the entire $3,584.42, on the \n\n[254 U.S. 581, 585]\n\u00a0\n ground that there was a failure of consideration and it was entitled to a return of the whole sum as paid by mistake. The amount in controversy is to be determined by the amended rather than the original petition (Washer v. Bullitt County, \n110 \nU.S. 558, 561\n, 562 S., 4 Sup. Ct. 249); and since there is nothing in the nature of the case to prevent a recovery of the entire amount, were claimant's view of the law sustained, the amount claimed is the amount in controversy within the meaning of the jurisdictional act, notwithstanding there may be a defense to a part that would not extend to the entire claim (Barry v. Edmunds, \n116 \nU.S. 550, 560\n, 561 S., 6 Sup. Ct. 501; Schunk v. Moline, etc., Co., \n147 \nU.S. 500, 504\n, 505 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 416; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. [No. 2], \n170 \nU.S. 468, 472\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 645; Smithers v. Smith \n204 \nU.S. 632, 642\n, 643 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 297).\n Upon the merits, we concur in the opinion of the Court of Claims that there is no legal basis for a recovery, The money was not paid under any such mistake as to render it inequitable for the United States to retain it. The bundles of newspapers actually were transported as mail by the government, claimant being charged by the postmaster the amount fixed by law for the service rendered, and paying it without protest. No error is shown to have been made in the weights or in the rate charged. So far as any 'mistake' appears from the findings it was that of claimant's agents in causing or permitting the papers to go by mail instead of by express as claimant intended. There is no finding attributing negligence or other fault to the mail transfer clerk; but if there were such and claimant's loss were attributable to it, this would not form a ground for recovery, since the United States has not consented to be sued in the Court of Claims for the torts of its officers or agents.

ANDERSON(1921)\nNo. 421\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Martin J. O'Donnell and Isaac B. Kimbrell, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petition for habeas corpus filed by the appellants on June 11, 1920, to obtain their release from confinement in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Leavenworth having, on motion of the United States, been dismissed on the face of the petition and documents annexed, the appeal which is now before us was prosecuted. We are therefore only concerned with the issues which legitimately arise from that situation.\n It was charged in the petition that on November 4, 1918, the petitioners were placed on trial before a general court-martial for violation of the ninty-sixth Article of War (Comp. St.  2308a), in having conspired to murder a named fellow prisoner, and of the ninety-second Article in having committed the murder, and that at the time of the alleged commission of the crimes stated they were undergoing imprisonment in the barracks in question under sentences which had been imposed upon them by courts-martial for military offenses. It was averred that the legality of the organization of the court and its jurisdiction was at once challenged, and on the challenge being overruled, each of the petitioners was, on November 25, 1918, found guilty of the murder charged, and as the result of the action of the President in mitigating and approving the sentences, they were each liable for a long term of imprisonment.\n The release which was prayed was based upon the following grounds: (1) Alleged illegality in the constitution \n\n[255 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n of the court; (2) an assertion that the petitioners did not possess the military statute essential to cause them to be subject to the court's jurisdiction; (3) that their subjection, even if they possessed such military status, to be tried by court-martial, deprived them of asserted constitutional rights, and (4) that in no event had the court-martial power to try them for murder under the conditions existing at the time of the trial. We come to consider whether the court erred in overruling these contentions.\n The fifth Article of War exacts that in any event a court-martial shall be composed of not less than 5 officers and must be composed of 13 when that number can be convened without manifest injury to the service. The court in this case was composed of 8 members, the order certifying that more than that number could not be convened without manifest injury to the service. The argument is that because the court was composed of less than 13 officers it was unlawfully constituted. But it has long been settled that the exercise of discretion as to fixing the number of the court with reference to the condition of the service, within the minimum and maximum limits, is executive and not subject to judicial review. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 34, 35; Bishop v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 334, 340\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 440. The objection is therefore without merit.\n Of the eight members of the court two were described in the order as retired officers and three as officers of the United States Guards. The contention is that, as by the fourth Article of War one must be an officer in the military service of the United States to be competent to sit on a court-martial, and as retired officers and officers of the United States Guards are not within that requirement, the constitution of the court was void. But both contentions, we are of opinion, are untenable; as to the retired officers, because it is not open to question, in view of the ruling in United States v. Tyler, \n105 U.S. 244\n, that such \n\n[255 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n officers are officers in the military service of the United States, and because it is equally certain that the order assigning the retired officers to the court was within the authority conferred by the Act of April 23, 1904, c. 1485, 33 Stat. 264 (Comp. St.  2078), which provides that:\n'The Secretary of War may assign retired officers of the Army, with their consent, to active duty ... upon courts-martial. ...'\n\n As to the United States Guards officers, there can also be no doubt that the President was fully empowered by section 2 of the Selective Service Act Of May 18, 1917, c. 15, 40 Stat. 77 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044b), to exert the power which he did by Special Regulations, No. 101, organizing the military force known as the United States Guards, and that such force, under the express terms of section 1 of the same act, were a part of the Army of the United States, and that these officers were therefore competent to be assigned to court-martial duty.\n As we have seen, the pleadings disclose that the alleged crimes were charged to have been committed by the accused while they were confined in a United States military prison undergoing punishment inflicted upon them, and upon this it is contended that either by implications resulting from the length of the sentences previously imposed and which were being suffered, or by assumption that there was a provision in the sentences to that effect, it resulted that the accused, by the convictions and sentences, ceased to be soldiers and were no longer subject to military law. But as the allegations of the petition and the contention based upon them concede that the petitioners were, at the time of the trial and sentence complainted of, military prisoners undergoing punishment for previous sentences, we are of opinion that even if their discharge as soldiers had resulted from the previous sentences which they were serving, it would be here immaterial, since as they remained military prisoners they were for that reason subject to military law and trial by court- martial for offenses committed during such im \n\n[255 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n prisonment. Thus, in dealing with that question, in Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 383\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 181, 188 (46 L. Ed. 236) it was said:\n'The accused was proceeded against as an officer of the Army, and jurisdiction attached in respect of him as such, which included not only the power to hear and determine the case, but the power to execute and enforce the sentence of the law. Having been sentenced, his status was that of a military prisoner held by the authority of the United States as an offender against its laws.\n\n'He was a military prisoner though he had ceased to be a soldier, and for offenses committed during his confinement he was liable to trial and punishment by court-martial under the rules and articles of war. Rev. Stat.  1361.'\n\n See, in addition, Act of March 3, 1915, c. 143, 38 Stat. 1084 (Comp. St. 2458a); 2d Article of War, par. (e); 16 Op. Attys. At. Gen. 292; In re Craig (C. C.) 70 Fed. 969; Ex parte Wildman, Fed. Cas. No. 17,653a.\n And as the authorities just referred to and the principles upon which they rest adequately demonstrate the unsubstantial character of the contention, that to give effect to the power thus long established and recognized would be repugnant to the Fifth Amendment, we deem it unnecessary to notice the question further.\n In connection with this subject we observe that a further contention, that conceding the accused to have been subject to military law, they could not be tried by a military court because Congress was without power to so provide consistently with the guaranties as to jury trial and presentment or indictment by grand jury, respectively secured by article 1 ,  8, of the Constitution, and article 5 of the Amendments, is also without foundation, since it directly denies the existence of a power in Congress exerted from the beginning, and disregards the numerous decisions of this court by which its exercise has been sustained-a situation which was so \n\n[255 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n obvious more than 40 years ago as to lead the court to say in Ex parte Reed, \n100 U.S. 13\n, 21 (25 L. Ed. 538);\n'The constitutionality of the acts of Congress touching army and navy courts-martial in this country, if there could ever have been a doubt about it, is no longer an open question in this court. Const. art. 1 ,  8, and Amendment 5. In Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, the subject was fully considered and their validity affirmed.'\n\n This brings us to the final contention, that because when the trial occurred it was time of peace no jurisdiction existed to try for murder, as Article 92 provided that--\n'... No person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the states of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.'\n\n That complete peace, in the legal sense, had not come to pass by the effect of the Armistice and the cassation of hostilities, is not disputable. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 106. It is therefore difficult to appreciate the reasoning upon which it is insisted that although the government of the United States was officially at war, nevertheless so far as the regulation and control by it of its army is concerned, it was at peace. Nor is it any less difficult to understand why reliance to sustain that proposition is placed on Caldwell v. Parker, \n252 U.S. 376\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 388, since that case involved no question of the want of jurisdiction of a court-martial over a crime committed by a soldier, but solely whether the jurisdiction which it was conceded such a court possessed was intended to be exclusive of a concurrent power in the state court to punish the same act, as the mere result of a declaration of war and without reference to any interruption, by a condition of war, of the power of the civil courts to perform their duty; and moreover in that case the question here raised was expressly reserved from decision.\n Coming now to consider that question in the light (1) \n\n[255 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n of the rulings in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2; Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 U.S. 509\n; Ex parte Mason, \n105 U.S. 696\n and Caldwell v. Parker, \n252 U.S. 376\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 388; (2) of the differences between the articles of 1874 and those of 1916 showing a purpose to rearrange the jurisdiction of courts-martial; (3) of the omission of the qualification, 'except in time of war,' from the clauses of the latter articles conferring jurisdiction as to designated offenses, including those capital (Articles 92 and 93), and its retention in the article dealing with the duty of the military to deliver to the state authorities (Article 74); and (4) of the placing in a separate article (Article 92) of the provision conferring jurisdiction as to murder and rape and qualifying that jurisdiction by the words, 'in time of peace,' not used in the previous articles, we are of opinion that that qualification signifies peace in the complete sense, officially declared. The fact that the articles of 1916 in other respects make manifest the legislative purpose to give effect to the previous articles as interpreted by the decided cases to which we have referred, at once convincingly suggests that a like reason controlled in adopting the limitation, 'except in time of peace,' contained in Article 92. See McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n, 438, where it was expressly decided that the limitation, 'except in time of peace,' on the power of the President to summarily dismiss a military officer, contemplated not a mere cessation of hostilities, but peace in the complete sense, officially proclaimed. Indeed, in that case it was pointed out that this significance of the words had received the sanction of Congress and had been made the basis for the adjustment of controversies depending upon the time when peace was established.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKAHN v.

Newcomb, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the executors of Abraham Wolff of New Jersey to have refunded $58,885.86 paid in taxes assessed upon legacies under the provisions of section 29 of the Act of June 13, 1898, \n\n[257 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 464, 465. Wolff died on October 1, 1900. The taxes were paid on November 4, 1903. This suit was begun July 2, 1917. The contention is that the legacies were contingent beneficial interests not vested in possession or enjoyment on, or prior to, July 1, 1902; and that hence the amount paid is recoverable under the Acts of June 27, 1902, c. 1160,  3, 32 Stat. 406, and of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240. The lower court dismissed the petition. Whether the interests assessed were contingent on July 1, 1902, and whether the claim sued on had been presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as required by the Act of 1912, are the questions argued before us. The view we take of the first question renders it unnecessary to consider the second.\n Earlier decisions have settled the construction of these statutes. The test to be applied in determining whether the legacies were, on July 1, 1902, still contingent is a practical, not a technical one. The beneficial interests were contingent unless the legatees were then in actual possession or enjoyment (Henry v. United States, \n251 U.S. 393\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 185), or were entitled to immediate possession or enjoyment ( United States v. Jones, \n236 U.S. 106\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 261, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316; McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 U.S. 562\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 421; Coleman v. United States, \n250 U.S. 30\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 414; Sage v. United States, \n250 U.S. 33\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 415). But a gift to trustees of a fund, the net income of which is to be paid over periodically during life, is, at least after the payments have commenced, a life estate, not a contingent, beneficial interest. United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n222 U.S. 158\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 59. And the mere failure of executors to establish the trust fund will not prevent the vesting of a legacy, if under the state law the time for payment has come, the right thereto is uncontroverted, and it is clear that the money retained will not be needed to satisfy outstanding claims. Simpson v. United States, \n252 U.S. 547\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 367.\n Wolff provided by his will, among other things, for fifteen separate trust funds, ranging in amount from \n\n[257 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n $20,000 to $100,000 and aggregating $730,000. The income of each was made payable for life to the beneficiary without power of anticipation or assignment. Provision was made that the executors should, until the several trusts were established, pay monthly to each a sum named; and these amounts were approximately, but not exactly, proportionate to the probable income of the respective funds. There was also a provision that, if the aggregate amount of the funds to be so established should exceed one-fifth of the net estate, each should be proportionately reduced. A trust of the residue was provided for the benefit of the testator's daughters. The amount or value of the fifteen trusts was ascertainable before July 1, 1902. None of the funds directed to be paid to the trustees had been paid to them, or set apart or established by that date; but no reason was shown why they should not have been. The value of the estate ( over $7,000,000) was such, and was before that date known to be such, that no pending controversy or outstanding claim could affect the value of any but the residuary legacies; and these only to a slight extent. The executors paid before that date certain small legacies, the fixed monthly allowances to the fifteen beneficiaries, and to each of the residuary legatees, as income, more than $300,000.\n The will was admitted to probate by the Orphans' Court for Morris County, on November 7, 1900, and letters testamentary issued on that day. By the law of New Jersey, executors are required to state and settle their accounts within a year after their appointment, unless the time is extended for cause. The Orphans' Court is empowered to fix a period of nine months for the presentation of claims against the estate; and claims not presented within that time may be declared barred. If no time is fixed in a will for the payment of legacies, they are payable within a year after the probate, and in not so paid, legatees may maintain an action therefor. Publication of \n\n[257 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n the notice to creditors to present their claims within nine months was begun on November 7, 1900. On August 8, 1901, that court entered an order declaring that creditors who had neglected to do so were barred. On July 1, 1902, the only unadjusted matters, so far as shown, were claims for taxes for relatively small sums. These were not finally disposed of until November, 1903\n\n\n On July 1, 1902, therefore, the trustees were entitled to the possession of the funds and all the beneficiaries to the immediate enjoyment of the income thereof, with the exception of the amount involved in controversies over taxes. The executors might then have paid over the balance of the estate in their hands to the trustees, retaining funds sufficient to satisfy the claims in dispute. The amount on which the taxes hare in question were assessed is not shown to have exceeded the amount of such balance. The beneficial interests were, therefore, vested, and taxes were properly assessed thereon. In Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 U.S. 480\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 331, and Uterhart v. United States, \n240 U.S. 598\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 417, the facts were different.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANS. CITY SO. RY. v. ROAD IMP. DIST.

Du Laney, of Ashdown, Ark., and William H. Arnold, of Texarkana, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Proceeding under Act 338, 1915 Session, Arkansas Legislature, the county court created and fixed the \n\n[256 U.S. 658, 659]\n\u00a0\n boundaries of 'road improvement district No. 6 of Little River county.' They include approximately 25,000 acres, and within them there are 9.7 miles of main track railroad owned and operated by petitioners, Kansas City Southern Railway Company and Texarkana & Ft. Smith Railway Company, together with the corresponding right of way, covering 130 acres, and requisite station buildings.\n Little River county is distinctly agricultural, has an area of 546 square miles, and 16,000 inhabitants. The improvement district was created for the purpose of constructing 11.2 miles of gravel road through taxation upon real property, defined by the statute as 'land, improvements thereon, railroads, railroad right of way and improvements thereon, including public buildings, side tracks, etc., and tramroads.'\n A duly appointed board assessed the benefits to plaintiff in error's property on account of the proposed road at $7,000 per mile of main track-$ 67,900. They divided the farming lands into five zones, determined by distance from the highway, and assessed uniform benefits upon all within the same zone without regard to improvements or market value-in the first $ 12 per acre, second $10, third $8, fourth $6, and fifth $4. Town lots were likewise assessed without reference to value or improvements at $10, $15, $ 20, and $25 each, according to location. A pipe line, telephone line, and telegraph line were severally assessed at $2,500, $300, and $300 per mile, without any designated basis.\n Plaintiffs in error duly maintained that the assessment upon their property was unequal, arbitrary, unreasonable, and in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state courts held to the contrary, and in effect declared the statute providing for the road improvement district authorized the action taken by the board, and that, so construed, it was a \n\n[256 U.S. 658, 660]\n\u00a0\n valid enactment. 139 Ark. 424, 215 S. W. 656, 217 S. W. 773. The validity of the statute having been adequately challenged, the cause is properly here upon writ of error, and the petition for certiorari will be denied.\n The settled general rule is that a state Legislature 'may create taxing districts to meet the expense of local improvements and may fix the basis of taxation without encountering the Fourteenth Amendment unless its action is palpably arbitrary or a plain abuse.'

Ct. 113.\n If, however, the statute providing for the tax is 'of such a character that there is no reasonable presumption that substantial justice generally will be done, but the probability is that the parties will be taxed disproportionately to each other and to the benefit conferred the law cannot stand against the complaint of one so taxed in fact.' Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., supra.\n The statute under consideration prescribes no definite standard for determining benefits from proposed improvements. The assessors made estimates as to farm lands and town lots according to area and position and wholly without regard to their value, improvements thereon, or their present or prospective use. On the other hand, disregarding both area and position, they undertook to estimate benefits to the property of plaintiffs in error without disclosing any basis therefor, but apparently according to some vague speculation as to present worth and possible future increased receipts from freight and passengers \n\n[256 U.S. 658, 661]\n\u00a0\n which would enhance its value, considered as a component part of the system.\n Obviously the railroad companies have not been treated like individual owners, and we think the discrimination so palpable and arbitrary as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the law. Benefits from local improvements must be estimated upon contiguous property according to some standard which will probably produce approximately correct general results. To say that 9.7 miles of railroad in a purely farming section, treated as an aliquot part of the whole system, will receive benefits amounting to $67,900 from the construction of 11.2 miles of gravel road, seems wholly improbable, if not impossible. Classification, of course, is permissible, but we can find no adequate reason for what has been attempted in the present case. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 560. It is doubtful whether any very substantial appreciation in value of the railroad property within the district will result from the improvements; and very clearly it cannot be taxed upon some fanciful view of future earnings and distributed values, while all other property is assessed solely according to area and position. Railroad property may not be burdened for local improvements upon a basis so wholly different from that used for ascertaining the contribution demanded of individual owners as necessarily to produce manifest inequality. Equal protection of the law must be extended to all.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKENNINGTON v.

U S(1921)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. Gibson, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A right of way for a canal, several miles in length, through lands of the United States in a public forest reserve in California, is here in controversy. The right of way was acquired by the Kern River Company, one of the appellants, through the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of an original map of the canal on April 14, 1899, and of an amended map on November 27, 1905. The purpose of the amended map was to conform the right of way to intervening changes in the line of the canal. The Secretary's approval, in both instances, was sought and was given under sections 18-21 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095 (Comp. St.  4934-4937, as supplemented by section 2 of the Act of May 11, 1898, c. 292, 30 Stat. 404 (Comp. St. 4938). The canal was constructed between July, 1902, and December, 1904, and ever since has been used for developing electric power, but never for irrigation. The power is transmitted to other parts of the state and there commercially supplied for use in operating electric railway systems, lighting municipalities, and operating pumping appliances on farms and ranches. The \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n appellants other than the Kern River Company claim under and through that company.\n This suit in equity was brought by the United States to obtain (a) a cancelation of the Secretary's approval of the two maps on the ground that it was obtained fraudulently by falsely representing that the right of way was sought with irrigation as the main purpose and the development of electric power as a subsidiary purpose, when in truth the latter was the sole purpose, or (b) a judicial declaration and enforcement of a forfeiture of the right of way on the ground that, although granted on condition that it be used mainly for irrigation, it in fact has been used solely for developing electric power, and its use for irrigation is precluded by a binding and continuing agreement on the part of the grantee. In the bill the first phase of the suit is set forth with greater precision and detail than are shown in the presentation of the other; but the other is there in full substance. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[257 U.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n The bill, while thus assailing the right of way obtained under the acts of 1891 and 1898, concedes that the appellants may yet apply for and obtain, under the Act of February 15, 1901, c. 372, 31 Stat. 790 (Comp. St .  4946), a permit or license to use the land for the purpore to which they now are applying it.\n After issue was joined the cause was heard on an agreed statement of facts supplemented by the testimony of a single witness and by some decumentary proof.\n The District Court concluded that the charge of fraud in procurding the Secretary's approval was not sustained, and that, in the absence of an act of Congrees declaring a forfeiture or providing for a suit to that end, a forfeiture could not be decreed by the court. The bill was accordingly dismissed. On appeal by the United States the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the charge of fraud was adequately proved, and also that, if the Secretary acted with full knowledge of the facts, he exceeded his authority. So the decree of dismissal was reversed, with directions that a decree be entered canceling the Secretary's approval, and also enjoining the further maintenance of the canal unless within a reasonable time the claimants applied for and obtained a lawful permit or license to use the same. 264 Fed. 412.\n The Act of 1891,  18-21, provided for rights of way through the public lands and reservations of the United States for ditches, canals and reservoirs for the purpose of irrigation but not for any other purpose. These rights of way were to be obtained by making application at the local land office and ultimately securing the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a map of the ditch, canal or reservoir. There was no provision for a patent. The grant was to become effective when the approval was given; that is to say, the right of way was then to vest in the applicant for the purpose indicated in the act. The approval, once given, could not be recalled or annulled by \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 152]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary, either for fraud practiced in procuring it or for mistake in giving it. To do that it was necessary to resort to a suit in equity. Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, 176 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 271. The right of way intended by the act was neither a mere easement nor a fee simple absolute, but a limited fee on an implied condition of reverter in the event the grantee ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose indicated in the act. Rio Grande Ry. Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44, 47\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 5.\n An Act of May 14, 1896, c. 179, 29 Stat. 120 (Comp. St.  4944), made express provision for rights of way through the public lands and forest reservations for the purpose of developing electric power; but this act differed from the one of 1891 in several respects, the one of most significance being that what the beneficiary was to receive was a revocable permit or license, and not a limited fee. This act was superseded by that of February 15, 1901, supra, which deals with the same subject along similar lines. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 407\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 387.\n The act of May 11, 1898, enacted while those of 1891 and 1896 were in force, provided in its second section:\n'That the rights of way for ditches, canals, or reservoirs heretofore or hereafter approved under the provisions of sections eighteen, nineteen, twenty, and twenty-one of the act entitled 'An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes,' approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, may be used for purposes of a public nature; and said rights of way may be used for purposes of water transportation, for domestic purposes, or for the development of power, as subsidiary to the main purpose of irrigation.'\n\n This section did no more than to permit rights of way obtained under the act of 1891, the use of which was restricted to irrigation, to be also used for the other purposes named in the section. Irrigation was still to be the 'main purpose,' and the other purposes were to be subsidiary. \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n True, there are in the section words and punctuation from which it might be argued that the 'purposes of a public nature' were to be independent and might even be exclusive; but the fair import of the section as a whole is the other way. Besides, its legislative history indicates that what actually was intended was to recognize irrigation as the primary purpose and to make all the other purposes secondary to it. When the bill was introduced in Congress it contained a provision declaring, without any qualification, that rights of way under the act of 1891 might be used for supplying water for 'domestic, public and other beneficial uses.' The committee in charge of the bill sought the views of the Land Department, and the Assistant Commissioner of the General Land Office submitted a report wherein he criticized that provision as being too much of a departure from the principle and spirit of the act of 1891, and recommended that it be eliminated and the present section substituted in its stead. In explaining and commending the section he said:\n'If it were allowable to use the right of way for domestic or public purposes or for certain other purposes, which will not diminish the amount of water available for irrigation, as subsidiary to the main purpose of irrigation, the act of 1891 would be much more satisfactory in its operation and the intention of the act as conferring a general benefit would be fully subserved.'\n\n The bill was amended in accordance with his recommendation and was enacted in that form. House Report, No. 2790, 54th Cong., 2d Sess.; House Report, No. 279, 55th Cong., 2d Sess. In administering the act of 1891 as thus supplemented the Secretary of the Interior was called upon to construe the section on several occasions, and his deisions were uniformly to the effect that it regarded irrigation as the controlling purpose and all the other uses as essentially subsidiary. See 28 L. D. 474; 32 L. D. 452 and 461; \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 154]\n\u00a0\n 37 L. D. 78; House Doc. No. 5, pp. xii-xiii, 56 Cong-1st Sess.; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, supra.\n Even if the meaning were not otherwise made plain we should be slow to reject the construction thus put on the section by the head of the department charged with administering it. Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 685\n\n\n The appellants take the position that the purposes for which they are selling the electric power are such as to make their use of the right of way a use for 'purposes of a public nature' in the sense of that section. But of this it suffices to say that, whether such a use be regarded as falling under that head or under the one described as the 'development of power,' it is a use which the section permits only where it is subsidiary to irrigation. It cannot take the place of the latter as the main purpose.\n With this understanding of the statutes under which the right of way was obtained, we pass the controverted charge of fraud in procuring the Secretary's approval and come at once to the question of forfeiture.\n The right of way, as we have seen, was granted on an implied condition that it should revert to the United States in the event the grantee ceased to use or retain it for the purpose indicated in the statutes. That purpose-the main and controlling one-was irrigation. The agreed statement of facts shows that the right of way never has been used for irrigation, and also that the appellants are effectually and permanently precluded from using it for that purpose by reason of an agreement entered into by the grantee and of a judicial decree to the rendition of which the grantee expressly consented. Thus it appears that the condition on which the grant was made has been not only broken, but also rendered impossible of performance. This entitles the United States to assert and enforce a forfeiture of the grant; and it is for this purpose that the present suit is brought. True, Congress has neither declared a forfeiture nor directed the suit; but \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 155]\n\u00a0\n this is not a valid objection. In the absence of some legislative direction to the contrary, and there is none, the general authority of the Attorney General in respect of the pleas of the United States and the litigation which is necessary to establish and safeguard its rights affords ample warrant for the institution and prosecution by him of a suit such as this. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 U.S. 273\n, 278-285, 8 Sup. Ct. 850. A suit brought in virtue of that authority and otherwise appropriate to the occasion is authorized by law in the sense of our decisions. See United States v. De Repentigny, 5 Wall. 211, 267-268; Atlantic & Pacific R. R. Co. v. Mingus, \n165 U.S. 413\n, 430-434, 17 Sup. Ct. 348; Spokane, etc., Ry. Co. v. Washington, etc., Ry. Co., \n219 U.S. 166\n, 173-174, 31 Sup. Ct. 182. This suit meets these requirements.\n The appellants invoke the rule that a court of equity usually is reluctant to lend its aid in enforcing a forfeiture. But where, as here, the right to the forfeiture is clear and is asserted in the public interest, equitable relief, if otherwise appropriate, is not withheld. Farnsworth v. Minnesota & Pacific R. R. Co., \n92 U.S. 49\n, 68; Union Land & Stock Co. v. United States, 257 Fed. 635, 168 C. C. A. 585.\n The statute placing a limitation of six years on the time within which 'suits to vacate and annul patents' may be brought (Act March 3, 1891, c. 559, 26 Stat. 1093 [Comp. St.  4992]) is also relied on. But in so far as this suit seeks to enforce a forfeiture for a breach of a condition subsequent it plainly is not a suit to vacate or annul a patent and so is not within the statute.\n We conclude that the United States is entitled to a decree declaring and enforcing a forfeiture. This renders it unnecessary to deal with the other phase of the suit.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly so modified as to direct the District Court to enter a decree declaring and enforcing a forfeiture of the right of way, and also enjoining the appellants from further \n\n[257 U.S. 147, 156]\n\u00a0\n occupying or using the land, unless within some reasonable time, to be fixed by that court, they apply for and obtain a right or license to use the same under the act of February 15, 1901, or some other applicable statute, and as so modified is affirmed.\n Decree modified and affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The District Court, in a memorandum opinion, said:\n'There are two aspects of this bill. One charges fraud perpetrated upon the government in the application for the grant. The other relies upon a forfeiture of the grant by reason of the alleged nonperformance by the defendant of the condition subsequent in the grant or a breach of a continuing covenant.' And also: 'The defendant is not using the right of way for irrigation and never has so used it, and the plaintiff claims that the grant should be forfeited to the government for failure to so use said right of way.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, taking a different view, said:\n'This is not a suit to declare a forfeiture of a land grant for breach of condition, but the ordinary suit to set aside the approval of the Secretary of the Interior on the ground of fraud and mistake.'\n\n The appellants, in their brief in this court, speak of the suit as one 'seeking to forfeit the right of way,' and also say:\n'The bill was brought against appellant, Kern River Company, on the ground that the right of way had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation and upon the ground that appellant was using the right of way for purposes other than those for which it had been acquired, namely, for purposes other than irrigation or power purposes subsidiary to the main purpose of irrigation.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKINNANE v.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff), as re-enacted in 1919 (Act Oct. 22, 1919, tit. 1,  2 [41 Stat. 298]), on the ground, among others, that the section was repugnant to the Constitution because of its vagueness and because it failed to provide a standard of criminality.\n The United States attorney after challenging in his answer the right to restrain the performance by him of his official duties, admitted that in its advisory capacity the said Price Committee had fixed what it had deemed to be a fair price for the sale of milk, and that he intended, in the discharge of his official duty, to act upon such advice as the basis for prosecutions, where such price was exceeded, and, asserting the constitutionality of the section and the want of merit in the grounds upon which it was assailed, prayed the dismissal of the bill.\n A temporary injunction issued, and the case having been submitted on the pleadings without proof, the court, stating that the sole question involved was whether the provision in question of section 4 of the Lever Act was constitutional, decided that it was not, because of its vagueness and uncertainty, and of the consequent absence from it of all standard of criminality. The enforcement of said provision was therefore permanently enjoined, and upon this appeal, the sole issue raised by the government is whether the court erred in holding the provision of the statute in question to be void for repugnancy to the Constitution. That it did not so err is fully established by the opinion this day announced in the Cohen Grocery Co. Case (No. 324) \n255 U.S. 84\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 298, 65 L.

It follows, for the reasons just stated and those expounded in the Cohen Grocery Case that the action below in all three cases must be and the same is hereby\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKRICHMAN v.

C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Krichman, petitioner, was convicted upon an indictment which charged that while the Pennsylvania Railroad was under the control of and being operated by the \n\n[256 U.S. 363, 364]\n\u00a0\n United States, he offered a bribe to a baggage porter to do an act in violation of his duty, contrary to Section 39 of the Criminal Code of the United States (35 Stat. 1096, 10 Comp. Stats.  10203). The section is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It appears that the porter was employed at the Pennsylvania terminal in the city of New York. The petitioner offered to bribe the porter to deliver to him certain trunks containing furs, which were checked from the Pennsylvania station to points outside the state of New York, and paid the porter a sum of money, and procured from him delivery of a trunk containing valuable furs.\n Petitioner moved in arrest of judgment, claiming that neither the indictment nor the evidence made out any offense under the statute. The District Court denied the motion. United States v. Krichman, 256 Fed. 974. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n\n[256 U.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n 263 Fed. 538. The case then came to this court by writ of certiorari, \n252 U.S. 576\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 344.\n The statutes and executive orders concerning railroads are stated in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 U.S. 135\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 502. By the statute of August 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 645 [Comp. St.  1974a]), c. 418,  1, the President was given power to take possession and assume control of the transportation systems of the country. After the declarations of war with Germany (April 6, 1917) and Austria ( December 7, 1917), the President issued a proclamation of December 26, 1917, taking possession of the transportation systems within the boundaries of the United States. 40 Stats. 1733, Comp. Stats. 1918,  1974a. The proclamation appointed a Director General of Railroads with full authority to take control of the systems, and to operate and administer them. See Act of March 21, 1918, 40 Stat. 451, for the full authority given the Director General by the proclamation of the President of March 29, 1918. Comp. Stats. 1918,  3115 3\/4 h.\n In order to sustain the conviction the bribe must have been given to an officer of the United States, or to a person acting for or on behalf of the United States in an official function under or by the authority of a department or office of the government.\n Clearly Krichman was not an officer of the United States. United States v. Maurice, 26 Fed. Cas. 1211, No. 15747; United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 393. We need not dwell upon this point, as the government concedes that the porter was not an officer within the meaning of the statute.\n The point to be decided depends upon whether, when the bribe was offered to the porter, he was acting for the United States in an official function. The decided cases do not afford much aid in reaching a solution of this problem, and in our view the cases cited in the opinions in the courts below throw little light upon the subject. \n\n[256 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n The statute creating the offense was passed long before there was any thought of the government taking over the railroads. That does not prevent its application if the thing done offends against it. It is however, a circumstance proper to be considered in determining whether the situation is one intended to be dealt with by Congress.\n The act aims to punish the attempted bribery or bribery of officials and those exercising official functions under or by the authority of a department or office of the government. Not every person performing any service for the government, however humble, is embraced within the terms of the statute. It includes those, not officers, who are performing duties of an official character. As was well suggested by Judge Ward in his dissenting opinion in the Circuit Court of Appeals, not every employee of the government is covered by the act, but a limitation is made applying to those acting in official functions. And he added:\n'The construction adopted by the court gives these words no meaning. They might as well, or indeed better, have been omitted, because window cleaners, scrub women, elevator boys, doorkeepers, pages-in short, any one employed by the United States to do anything-is included.'\n\n The government admits that the construction contended for will include the employees suggested by Judge Ward. Indeed, the construction given by the courts below would bring within the statute every employee acting under the Director General in the operation of the railroads. We are unable to accept this construction of a criminal statute.\n In United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165, 65 L. Ed . --, decided at this term, January 3, 1921, this court held that the Emergency Fleet Corporation, organized by the Shipping Board, and authorized by the President to exercise a portion of the power granted to him under the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182, \n\n[256 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n was a separate entity from the government which owned all of its stock, and that an inspector of the Shipping Board was not an agent of the United States within the meaning of section 41 of the Criminal Code (Comp. Stats .  10205), making it an offense for any officer or agent of any corporation, etc., and any member or agent of any firm, or person directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary profits or contracts of such corporation, etc., to be employed or to act as an officer or agent of the United States for the transaction of business with such corporation, etc. Subsequently the statute was amended so as to bring the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation within its terms as a governmental establishment, and, later, to make it an offense to defraud or to conspire to defraud any corporation in which the United States owned stock. So, in our view, if section 39 is to include every governmental employee, it must be amended by act of Congress.\n It is true that in the emergencies of war the government took over the operation of the railroads, and placed them under the control of the President, acting by his chosen Director General, who was given full authority to avail himself of the services of railroad officials, directors, employees, etc., with ample authority over all. But we cannot believe that this action brought every service, however remote from the exertion of official authority, into the exercise of an official function within the meaning of the statute. We are constrained to the conclusion that the construction given in the courts below, and insisted upon by the government, practically recasts the statute from one embracing officials, and those discharging official functions, into one including every person discharging any sort of duty while the government is in control of the work.\n The government admits that the statute is ambiguous. While criminal statutes are to be given a reasonable con struction, \n\n[256 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n ambiguities are not to be solved so as to embrace offenses not clearly within the law. We are unable to remedy the uncertainties of this statute by attributing to Congress an intention to include a baggage porter with those who discharge official duties in the operation of a railroad controlled by an officer of the government.\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 39 is as follows:\n'Whoever shall promise, offer, or give, or cause or procure to be promised, offered, or given, any money, or other thing of value, or shall make or tender any contract, undertaking, obligation, gratuity, or security for the payment of money, or for the delivery or conveyance of anything of value, to any officer of the United States, or to any person acting for or on behalf of the United States in any official function, under or by authority of any department or office of the government thereof, or to any officer or person acting for or on behalf of either house of Congress, or of any committee of either house, or both houses thereof, with intent to influence his decision or action on any question, matter, cause, or proceeding which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before him in his official capacity, or in his place of trust or profit, or with intent to influence him to commit or aid in committing, or to collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States, or to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty, shall be fined not more than three times the amount of money or value of the thing so offered, promised, given, made, or tendered, or caused or procured to be so offered, promised, given, made, or tendered, and imprisoned not more than three years.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLA BELLE IRON WORKS v.

Hughes, of New York City, and J. Harry Covington, Edward B. Burling, Spencer Gordon, and Oscar W. Underwood, Jr., all of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for the United States. \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Claims dismissed appellant's petition which claimed a refund of $1,081,184.61, alleged to have been erroneously assessed and exacted as an 'excess profits tax' under title 2 of the Revenue Act of 1917 (Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 302 et seq. [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919;  6336 3\/8a et seq.]). The case involves the construction and application of those provisions by which the deduction from income, for the purposes of the tax, is measured by the 'invested capital' of the taxpayer; and a question is raised as to the constitutionality of the act as construed and applied.\n Title 1 of the act imposed 'war income taxes' upon individuals and corporations in addition to those imposed by Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756. Title 2 provided for the levying of 'war excess profits taxes' upon corporations, partnerships, and individuals. As applied to domestic corporations, the scheme of this title was that, after providing for a deduction from income (section 203, p. 304 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/8 d]), equal to the same percentage of the invested capital for the taxable year which the average amount of the annual net income of the trade or business during the prewar period (the years 1911, 1912, and 1913) was of the invested capital for that period, but not less than 7 nor more than 9 per cent., plus $3,000, it imposed ( section 201, p. 303 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/8 b]), in addition to other taxes, a graduated tax upon the net income beyond the deduction, commencing with 20 per centum of such net income above the deduction, but not above 15 per centum of the invested capital for the taxable year, and running as high as 60 per centum of the net income in excess of 33 per centum of such capital. It applied to 'all trades or business,' with exceptions not now material (page 303). \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 384]\n\u00a0\n What should be deemed 'invested capital' was defined by section 207 ( page 306 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/8h]), which, so far as pertinent, is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The case was decided upon a demurrer to the petition, in which the facts were stated as follows: Appellant is a domestic corporation and, prior to the year 1904, acquired ore lands for which it paid the sum of $ 190,000. Between that time and the year 1912 exten sive explorations and developments were carried on (the cost of which is not stated), and it was proved that the lands contained large bodies of ore and had an actual cash value \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n not less than $10,105,400, and at all times during the years 1912 to 1917, inclusive, their actual cash value was not less than the sum last mentioned. In the year 1912 the company increased the valuation of said lands upon its books by adding thereto the sum of $10,000,000, which it carried to surplus, and thereupon, in the same year, declared a stock dividend in the sum of $9,915,400, representing the increase in value of the ore lands. Theretofore appellant's capital stock and consisted of shares issued, all of one class, having a par value of $9,915,400. The declaration of the stock dividend was carried out by the surrender to the company of all the outstanding stock, and its cancellation, and the exchange of one share of new common and one share of new preferred stock for each share of the original stock.\n In returning its annual net income for the year 1917 the company stated its invested capital to be $26,322,904.14, in which was included the sum of $10,105,400 as representing the value of its ore lands. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue caused a reassessment to be made, based upon a reduction of the invested capital to $16,407,507.14; the difference ($9,915,400) being the increase in the value of the ore lands already mentioned. The result was an additional tax of $1,081,184.61, which, having been paid, was made the subject of a claim for refund; and this having been considered and rejected by \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 386]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner, there followed a suit in the Court of Claims, with the result already mentioned.\n Appellant's contentions, in brief, are: First, that the increased value of the ore lands, placed upon the company's books in 1912, ought to be included in invested capital under section 207(a)(3), as 'paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits.' Second, that within the meaning of clause (2), which provides that invested capital shall include 'the actual cash value of tangible property paid in other than cash, for stock or shares in such corporation,' the stock of the company issued in 1912, consisting of $9,915,400 of preferred stock and an equal amount of common, was fully paid for: Either (a) by the tangible assets, including the ore properties at their increased value, or (b) by the surrender of all the certificates representing the old common stock, which, it is said, had an actual cash value equal to double its par. And, third, that the construction put upon the act by the Treasury Department, based as it is said not upon value but upon the single feature of cost, disregarding the time of acquisition, would render the act unconstitutional as a deprivation of property without due process under the Fifth Amendment, because so arbitrary as to amount in effect to confiscation, and hence that this construction must be avoided.\n Reading the entire language of section 207 in the light of the circumstances that surrounded the passage of the act, we think its meaning as to 'invested capital' is entirely clear. The great war in Europe had been in progress since the year 1914, and the manufacture and export of war supplies and other material for the belligerent powers had stimulated many lines of trade and business in this country, resulting in large profits as compared with the period before the war, and as compared with ordinary returns upon the capital embarked. The United States had become directly involved in the conflict in the spring \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 387]\n\u00a0\n of 1917, necessitating heavy increases in taxation; at the same time manufactures and trade of every description were rendered even more active, and in certain lines more profitable, than before, so that the unusual gains derived therefrom formed a natural subject for special taxation.\n On the eve of our entry, and in order to provide a 'special preparedness fund' for army, navy, and fortification purposes, Act March 3, 1917, c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000, was passed, which, in title 2, provided for an excess profits tax on corporations and partnerships equal to 8 per centum of the amount by which their net income exceeded $5,000 plus 8 per centum of the 'actual capital invested'; and, in section 202 (p. 1001), defined this term to mean '(1) actual cash paid in; (2) the actual cash value, at the time of payment, of assets other than cash paid in; and (3) paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits used or employed in the business,' but not to include money or other property borrowed.\n The Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, passed after we had become engaged in the war, took the place of the Act of March 3, and embodied a 'war excess profits tax,' with higher percentages imposed upon the income in excess of deductions and a more particular definition of terms. A scrutiny of the particular provisions of section 207 shows that it was the dominant purpose of Congress to place the peculiar burden of this tax upon the income of trades and businesses exceeding what was deemed a normally reasonable return upon the capital actually embarked. But if such capital were to be computed according to appreciated market values based upon the estimates of interested parties (on whose returns perforce the government must in great part rely), exaggerations would be at a premium, corrections difficult, and the tax easily evaded. Section 207 shows that Congress was fully alive to this and designedly adopted a term-'invested capital'-- and a definition of it, that would \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 388]\n\u00a0\n measurably guard against inflated valuations. The word 'invested' in itself imports a restrictive qualification. When speaking of the capital of a business corporation or partnership, such as the act deals with, 'to invest' imports a laying out of money, or money's worth, either by an individual in acquiring an interest in the concern with a view to obtaining income or profit from the conduct of its business, or by the concern itself in acquiring something of permanent use in the business; in either case involving a conversion of wealth from one form into another suitable for employment in the making of the hoped-for gains. See Webster's New Internat. Dict. 'Invest,' 8; Century Dict. 'Invest,' 7; Standard Dict. 'Invest,' 1.\n In order to adhere to this restricted meaning and avoid exaggerated valuations, the draftsman of the act resorted to the test of including nothing but money, or money's worth, actually contributed or converted in exchange for shares of the capital stock, or actually acquired through the business activities of the corporation or partnership (involving again a conversion) and coming in ab extra, by way of increase over the original capital stock. How consistently this was carried out becomes evident as the section is examined in detail. Cash paid in, and tangible property paid in other than cash, are confined to such as were contributed for stock or shares in the corporation or partnership; and the property is to be taken at its actual cash value 'at the time of such payment'-distinctly negativing any allowance for appreciation in value. There is but a single exception: Tangible property paid in prior to January 1, 1914, may be taken at its actual cash value on that date, but in no case exceeding the par value of the original stock or shares specifically issued for it; a restriction in itself requiring the valuation to be taken as of a date prior to the war period, and in no case to exceed the stock valuation placed upon it at the \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 389]\n\u00a0\n time it was contributed. The provision of clause (3) that includes 'paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits used or employed in the business' recognizes that in some cases contributions are received from stockholders in money or its equivalent for the specific purpose of creating an actual excess capital over and above the par value of the stock; and, in view of the context, surplus 'earned' as well as that 'paid in' excludes the idea of capitalizing (for the purposes of this tax) a mere appreciation of values over cost.\n The same controlling thought is carried into the proviso, which relates to the valuation of patents, copyrights, trade-marks, good will, franchises, and similar intangible property. Every line shows evidence of a legislative purpose to confine the account to such items as were paid in for stock or shares, and to their values 'at the time of such payment'; but, with regard to those bona fide purchased prior to March 3, 1917, there is a special provision, limiting the effect of any adjustments that might have been made in view of the provisions of the act of that date.\n It is clear that clauses (1) and (2) refer to actual contributions of cash or of tangible property at its cash value contributed in exchange for stock or shares specifically issued for it; and that neither these clauses, nor clause (3) which relates to surplus, can be construed as including within the definition of invested capital any marking up of the valuation of assets upon the books to correspond with increase in market value, or any paper transaction by which new shares are issued in exchange for old ones in the same corporation, but which is not in substance and effect a new acquisition of capital property by the company.\n It is clear enough that Congress adopted the basis of 'invested capital' measured according to actual contributions made for stock or shares and actual accessions \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 390]\n\u00a0\n in the way of surplus, valuing them according to actual and bona fide transactions and by valuations obtaining at the time of acquisition, not only in order to confine the capital, the income from which was to be in part exempted from the burden of this special tax, to something approximately representative of the risks accepted by the investors in embarking their means in the enterprise, but also in order to adopt tests that would enable returns to be more easily checked by examination of records, and make them less liable to inflation than if a more liberal meaning of 'capital and surplus' had been adopted; thus avoiding the necessity of employing a special corps of valuation experts to grapple with the many difficult problems that would have ensued had general market values been adopted as the criteria.\n In view of the special language employed in section 207, obviously for the purpose of avoiding appreciated valuations of assets over and above cost, the argument that such value is as real as cost value, and that in the terminology of corporation and partnership accounting 'capital and surplus' mean merely the excess of all assets at actual values over outstanding liabilities, and 'surplus' means the intrinsic value of all assets over and above outstanding liabilities plus par of the stock, is beside the mark. Nor has the distinction between capital and income, discussed in Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 467, Hays v. Gauley Mtn. Coal Co., \n247 \nU.S. 189, 193\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 470, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 334\n, 335 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 540, any proper bearing upon the questions here presented.\n Upon the strength of an administrative interpretation contained in a Treasury Regulation pertaining to the Revenue Act of 1917, under which 'stocks' were to be regarded as tangible property when paid in for stock or shares of a corporation, it is insisted that appellant's stock dividend distribution of 1912 ought to be treated \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 391]\n\u00a0\n as paid for in tangible property, the old stock surrendered being regarded as tangible for the purpose. But that distribution, in substance and effect, was an internal transaction, in which the company received nothing from the stockholders any more than they received anything from it (see Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 210\n, 211 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570), and the old shares cannot be regarded as having been 'paid in for' the new ones within the meaning of section 207 (a)(2), even were they 'stocks' within the meaning of that regulation, which is doubtful.\n It is said that the admitted increase in the value of appellant's ore lands is properly to be characterized as earned surplus, because it was the result of extensive exploration and development work. We assume that a proper sum, not exceeding the cost of the work, might have been added to earned surplus on that account; but none such was stated in appellant's petition, nor, so far as appears, in its return of income. In the absence of such a showing it was not improper to attribute the entire $9,915,400, added to the book value of the ore property in the year 1912, to a mere appreciation in the value of the property; in short, to what is commonly known as the 'unearned increment,' not properly 'earned surplus' within the meaning of the statute.\n The foregoing considerations dispose of the contention that either the increased value of appellant's ore lands, or the surrender of the old stock in exchange for the new issues based upon that value, can be regarded as 'tangible property paid in other than cash, for stock or shares in such corporation' within the meaning of section 207 (a)(2), and of the further contention that such increased value can properly be regarded as 'paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits' under section 207 (a)(3).\n It is urged that this construction, defining invested capital according to the original cost of the property instead of its present value, has the effect of rendering the \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 392]\n\u00a0\n act 'glaringly unequal' and of doubtful constitutionality; the insistence being that, so construed, it operates to produce baseless and arbitrary discriminations, to the extent of rendering the tax invalid under the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. Reference is made to cases decided under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ( Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 418\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 255); but clearly they are not in point. The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause; and the only rule of uniformity prescribed with respect to duties, imposts, and excises laid by Congress is the territorial uniformity required by article 1,  8. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 557; 15 Sup. Ct. 673; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 98\n, 106 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 747; Flint v.

That the statute under consideration operates with territorial uniformity is obvious and not questioned.\n Appellant cites Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 85, and International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135, 145\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617, but these cases also are inapplicable, being based upon the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with which state taxing laws were held in conflict because they had the effect of imposing taxes on the property of foreign corporations located and used beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing state. There is no such infirmity here.\n Nor can we regard the act-in basing 'invested capital' upon actual costs to the exclusion of higher estimated values-as productive of arbitrary discriminations raising a doubt about its constitutionality under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The difficulty of adjusting any system of taxation so as to render it precisely equal in its bearing is proverbial, and such nicety is not even required of the states under the equal protection \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 393]\n\u00a0\n clause, much less of Congress under the more general requirement of due process of law in taxation. Of course it will be understood that Congress has very ample authority to adjust its income taxes according to its discretion, within the bounds of geographical uniformity. Courts have no authority to pass upon the propriety of its measures; and we deal with the present criticism only for the purpose of refuting the contention, strongly urged, that the tax is so wholly arbitrary as to amount to confiscation.\n The act treats all corporations and partnerships alike, so far as they are similarly circumstanced. As to one and all, Congress adjusted this tax, generally speaking, on the basis of excluding from its operation income to the extent of a specified percentage (7 to 9 per cent.) of the capital employed, but upon condition that such capital be valued according to what actually was embarked at the outset or added thereafter, disregarding any appreciation in values. If in its application the tax in particular instances may seem to bear upon one corporation more than upon another, this is due to differences in their circumstances, not to any uncertainty or want of generality in the tests applied.\n Minor distinctions-such as those turning upon the particular dates of January 1, 1914, and March 3, 1917-are easily explained, as we have seen. The principal line of demarcation-that based upon actual costs, excluding estimated appreciation-finds reasonable support upon grounds of both theory and practice, in addition to the important consideration of convenience in administration, already adverted to. There is a logical incongruity in entering upon the books of a corporation as the capital value of property acquired for permanent employment in its business and still retained for that purpose, a sum corresponding not to its cost but to what probably might be realized by sale in the market. It is not merely that \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 394]\n\u00a0\n the market value has not been realized or tested by sale made, but that sale cannot be made without abandoning the very purpose for which the property is held, involving a withdrawal from business so far as that particular property is concerned. Whether in a given case property should be carried in the capital account at market value rather than at cost may be a matter of judgment, depending upon special circumstances and the local law. But certainly Congress, in seeking a general rule, reasonably might adopt the cost basis, resting upon experience rather than anticipation.\n In organizing corporations, it is not unusual to issue different classes of securities, with various priorities as between themselves, to represent different kinds of contribution to capital. In exchange for cash, bonds may be issued; for fixed properties, like plant and equipment, preferred stock may be given; while more speculative values, like good will or patent rights, may be represented by common stock. In the present case, for instance, when appellant took the estimated increase in value of its ore lands as a basis for increased capitalization, issued preferred stock to the amount of the former total, carrying those lands at cost, and issued a like amount of common stock to represent the appreciation in their market value. It does not appear that in form the new issues were thus allocated; but at least there was a recognition of a higher claim in favor of one part of the book capital than of the other. Upon like grounds, it was not unreasonable for Congress, in adjusting the 'excess profits tax,' to accord preferential treatment to capital representing actual investments, as compared with capital representing higher valuations based upon estimates, however confident and reliable, of what probably could be realized were the property sold instead of retained.\n From every point of view, the tax in question must be sustained. We intimate no opinion upon the effect of \n\n[256 U.S. 377, 395]\n\u00a0\n the act with respect to deductions from cost values of capital assets because of depreciation or the like; no question of that kind being here involved.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 207.

U.S.(1921)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 570, 571]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. J. Leahy and Chas. S. MacDonald, both of Pawhuska, Okl., for appellants.\n Messrs. F. K. Nebeker and E. M. Underwood, Asst. Attys.

The District Court granted the major part of the relief sought and denied the rest. On cross-appeals the Circuit Court of Appeals enlarged the relief granted, but refused a part of what was denied by the District Court. 256 Fed. 5, 167 C. C. A. 277. The United States then acquiesced and the defendants took a further appeal to this court.\n Prior to the Act of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539, the lands to which the suit relates were tribal lands of the Osage Indians, and after that act were divided under its provisions among the members of the tribe, as were also the tribal funds. Each member received 160 acres designated as a homestead and approximately 500 acres designated as surplus lands. The tribal funds were divided by placing a pro rata share to the credit of each member or his heirs in the United States Treasury. Except as otherwise provided, the homestead is to be 'inalienable and nontaxable for a period of twenty-five years, or during the life of the homestead allottee,' the surplus lands are to be 'inalienable for twenty- five years' and nontaxable for 3 years, and the funds as distributed are to be held in trust by the United States for 25 years. These periods do not all have a common point of beginning, but nothing turns on that here. The act contains express provision (section 2, Seventh) that the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, upon the petition of any adult member, may issue to such member 'a certificate of competency' authorizing him to sell and convey any of his surplus lands, if, upon investigation, he is found fully competent and capable of transacting his own business and caring for his own affairs, and that upon the issue of such certificate the surplus lands shall become subject to taxation and the member \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n shall have 'the right to manage, control and dispose of his or her lands [ other than the homestead] the same as any citizen of the United States.' The interest on the funds held in trust and also certain revenues and moneys from other sources (section 4, First and Second) are to be paid quarterly to the members, except that in the case of minors payments are to be made to the parents, so long as the moneys are not misused or squandered, and where the parents are dead payments are to be made to legal guardians. Upon the death of a member his lands, moneys and interests 'descend' to his 'legal heirs' according to the laws of Oklahoma, with an exception not material here (section 6). The leasing of allotted lands is specially dealt with as follows:\n'Sec. 7. That the lands herein provided for are set aside for the sole use and benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or to their heirs, as herein provided; and said members, or their heirs, shall have the right to use and to lease said lands for farming, grazing, or any other purpose not otherwise specifically provided for herein, and said members shall have full control of the same, including the proceeds thereof: Provided, that parents of minor members of the tribe shall have the control and use of said minors' lands, together with the proceeds of the same, until said minors arrive at their majority: And provided further, that all leases given on said lands for the benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or for their heirs, shall be subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n Besides several provisions indicating that the act is to be executed under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, there is a concluding section declaring:\n'Sec. 12. That all things necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this act not otherwise herein specifically provided for shall be done under the authority and direction of the Secretary of the Interior.'- \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n\n An amendatory Act of April 18, 1912, c. 83, 37 Stat. 86, by its third section, subjects the property of deceased, orphan minor, insane and some other allottees to the jurisdiction of the county courts of Oklahoma in probate matters, but with the qualification, first, 'that no guardian shall be appointed for a minor whose parents are living unless the estate of said minor is being wasted or misused by such parents,' and, secondly, 'that no land shall be sold or alienated under ... this section without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.' This amendatory act also contains a section dealing with disposals by will of which we shall speak presently.\n In virtue of sections 7 and 12 of the Act of 1906 the Secretary of the Interior adopted and promulgated regulations designating the mode in which leases of restricted lands for farming or grazing purposes should be executed and brought to his attention, indicating the terms and conditions which should be embodied in the leases for the protection of the Indian lessors, and informing intending lessors and lessees that where the regulations were not complied with the leases would not be approved.\n The defendants (appellants here) are engaged in procuring leases of Osage lands for farming and grazing purposes, especially the latter. At times the leases are procured for their own benefit and at other times in the interest of cattlemen who desire and need large pastures. Where cattlemen are to be the beneficiaries, the defendants often take the leases in their own names and agree to protect the cattlemen against claims for trespass or damage. Some of the leases are for homesteads, others for surplus lands. Some are procured from adult allottees, or adult heirs of allottees, having certificates of competency, and some from like allottees or heirs where no such certificate has been issued. Others are obtained from parents or legal guardians of minor allottees or minor heirs, and still others from devisees holding under wills approved by the \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Interior. Many of the leases are for restricted lands and yet are taken without conforming to the regulations and without obtaining the Secretary's approval. But notwithstanding this, the defendants proceed to use the lands for grazing purposes, or to enable others to do so, as if the leases were properly obtained. The failure to conform to the statute and the regulations is not accidental, but intentional and persistent.\n The right of the United States to maintain the suit, although challenged by the defendants, is not debatable. The Osages have not been fully emancipated, but are still wards of the United States. The restrictions on the disposal and leasing of their allotments constitute an important part of the plan whereby they are being conducted from a state of tribal dependence to one of individual independence and responsibility; and outsiders, such as the defendants, are bound to respect the restrictions quite as much as are the allottees and their heirs. Authority to enforce them, like the power to impose them, is an incident of the guardianship of the United States. That relation and the obligations arising therefrom enable the United States to maintain the suit, notwithstanding it is without pecuniary interest in the relief sought. Heckman v. United States, \n224 U.S. 413\n, 437-442, 32 Sup. Ct. 424; United States v. New Orleans Pacific Ry. Co., \n248 \nU.S. 507, 518\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 175; United States v. Osage County, \n251 \nU.S. 128, 133\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 100. And see Causey v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 365.\n It is insistently urged that the regulations adopted and promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior are void and of no effect, and therefore that no right to relief can be predicated upon the defendants' disregard of them. The argument advanced is that the leasing provision says nothing about regulations; that the clause 'subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior' makes strongly against any regulations; that what is intended is to leave the Indian free to lease in his own way and on his \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n own terms, subject to the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the lease after it is given; and that the regulations, as adopted and promulgated, unwarrantably interfere with this freedom of action. In our opinion the insistence is not tenable, and for the following reasons:\n The fact that the leasing provision says nothing about regulations is not important, for section 12 plainly enables the Secretary to employ any necessary means to carry that provision into effect. And, even without section 12, power to make regulations suitable to that end and consistent with the act would be implied. United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 238, 254, 255.\n The need for some regulations is obvious. The Osages among whom the lands were divided number about 2,000 and each member received an aggregate of approximately 660 acres, often in scattered tracts. All the lands were restricted in the beginning and most of them probably will remain so for several years. The leases are subjected to the Secretary's approval or disapproval to the end that the allottees and their heirs may be protected from their own improvidence and from overreaching by others. Both the lands and the Indians are remote from the seat of government, and without some general and authoritative rules for the guidance of intending lessors and lessees it is certain that improvident and ill-advised leases would be given and multiplied in a way which would confuse and embarrass the Indians and greatly enhance the difficulties attending the Secretary's supervision.\n We find nothing in the leasing provision indicating that no regulations are intended. True, the concluding proviso declares that 'all leases given on said lands for the benefit of individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or for their heirs, shall be subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.' But this means, as the context and other parts of the act show, that leases given on restricted lands for the benefit of individual allottees, or \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 577]\n\u00a0\n their heirs, and not for the benefit of the tribe, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, but need not have the sanction of the tribal council. The word 'only,' on which the defendants place much emphasis, merely aids in marking an intended distinction between leases given for the benefit of individuals and those given for the benefit of the tribe-the latter, as section 3 shows, needing the sanction of the tribal council as well as the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n Without doubt the regulations prescribed operate to restrain the Indian from leasing in his own way and on his own terms, but this is not a valid objection. If there were no regulations, the disapproval of a lease satisfactory to him would work a like restraint. Manifestly some restraint is intended, for the leasing provision does not permit the Indian to lease as he pleases, but only with the Secretary's approval.\n The regulations appear to be consistent with the statute, appropriate to its execution, and in themselves reasonable.\n It follows from what has been said that in the main the action of both courts below was correct; that is to say, the defendants were properly enjoined from asserting or exercising any right under leases of restricted lands given by individual Osages without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and from negotiating or procuring other leases of the same class without conforming to the regulations prescribed.\n Several questions relating to particular leases or lands remain to be noticed.\n The defendants have leases of restricted lands, belonging to minor allottees or minor heirs, which were given by guardians with the sanction of the local courts in which the guardianships were pending, but were not approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The District Court ruled that the Secretary's approval was not required and the Circuit Court of Appeals held to the contrary. We take the latter \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 578]\n\u00a0\n view. It is supported by the comprehensive words of the concluding proviso of the leasing provision and is strengthened by the second qualification found in section 3 of the amendatory Act of 1912, under which the local courts obtain probate jurisdiction over the property of such minors, and by the proviso in section 6 of that act relating to the partition of inherited lands.\n Some of the defendants' leases of restricted lands were given by parents on behalf of minor allottees or minor heirs-one of the parents having a certificate of competency and the other being of white blood and not a member of the tribe. Both courts ruled that the Secretary's approval was essential, and rightly so, as we think. In giving such leases the parents act for the child, not for themselves, and approval by the Secretary is required by reason of the child's status, as would be true if the lease were given by a guardian.\n One of the leases held by the defendants is for lands which, in the course of the division, were selected and allotted in the right of a member then deceased. Under the statute the lands passed to the member's heirs and the lease was procured from them. They are members and without certificates of competency. The lease has not been approved by the Secretary. Both courts regarded the lands as restricted and the lease as requiring the Secretary's approval. That view has since been sustained by us in Kenney v. Miles, \n250 U.S. 58\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 417.\n Two leases, not approved by the Secretary, are for lands which passed to devisees under wills approved by that officer and duly admitted to probate. Both testators were adult members of the tribe, not mentally incompetent. One was an allottee and the other the sole heir of a deceased allottee. In their hands the lands were restricted. The defendants insist that under the approved wills the lands passed to the devisees freed from the restrictions. If so, the leases did not require the Secretary's approval. Both \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 579]\n\u00a0\n courts held that the lands continued to be restricted. The question is not free from difficulty, but we think it must be ruled the other way. Strictly speaking a devisee takes under the will as an instrument of conveyance, and not by descent as an heir. This form of alienation was within the restriction imposed by the Act of 1906, Taylor v. Parker, \n235 U.S. 42\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 22, but the amendatory Act of 1912 relaxed the restriction by declaring:\n'Sec. 8. That any adult member of the Osage Tribe of Indians not mentally incompetent may dispose of any or all of his estate, real, personal, or mixed, including trust funds, from which restrictions as to alienation have not been removed, by will, in accordance with the laws of the state of Oklahoma: Provided, that no such will shall be admitted to probate or have any validity unless approved before or after the death of the testator by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n This provision is broadly written, is in terms applicable to restricted lands and funds, and enables the Indian to dispose of all or any part of his estate by will, in accordance with the state law, if his will be approved by the Secretary. True, it does not say that a disposal by an approved will shall put an end to existing restrictions, but that is an admissible, if not the necessary, conclusion from its words. After its enactment the Secretary of the Interior construed it as having that meaning, and it was administered accordingly in that department up to the time of this suit. And that Congress intended it should have that meaning is at least inferable from a general act of the next session respecting wills by Indian allottees and their approval by the Secretary (chapter 55, 37 Stat. 678 [Comp. St.  4228]); for that act, while providing that 'the approval of the will and the death of the testator shall not operate to terminate the trust or restrictive period,' expressly excepted the Osages from its reach. These matters apparently were not brought to the attention of the courts below. low. We regard them as of sufficient \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 580]\n\u00a0\n weight to put the question at rest. In one of the wills the testator attempted to impose an indefinite restraint on the devisee's right to alienate the land; but, whether the attempt be tested by the common law or by the local statutes, it plainly was of no effect. We modify the decree by excluding this class of leases from the injunction.\n Some of the leases are for lands which were purchased by the lessors after the lands in regular course had become unrestricted. Because the lessors were members of the tribe and without certificates of competency the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the leases were subject to the Secretary's approval. The District Court had held the other way. We think the District Court was right. There is no provision in the Act of 1906 or that of 1912 which reimposes restrictions after they have been removed, or which subjects to restrictions all lands, however acquired, which a member without a certificate of competency may own. See McCurdy v. United States, \n246 U.S. 263\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 289. The restrictions reach such lands only as were allotted to the member or were inherited by him from another in whose hands they were restricted. Many members who are without certificates of competency have incomes and property which they are free to deal with as they choose. Some have purchased from white men having full title and an undoubted right to sell. See Levindale Lead Co. v. Coleman, \n241 U.S. 432\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 644. As to this class of leases we so modify the decree that the injunction shall not include them.\n Through purchases or leases from heirs who have certificates of competency, or are white men and not members of the tribe, the defendants have come lawfully to own, or have leases of, undivided interests in particular lands the remaining interests in which continue to be restricted; and the defendants are using or exerting control over these lands to the exclusion of the Indian owners of the restricted interests. This use or control is colorably based on unapproved leases and other forms of consent given by \n\n[254 U.S. 570, 581]\n\u00a0\n the other owners which are without legal sanction. Both courts rightly condemned thses acts and portions of the injunction are directed against them. But as to some of the lands the injunction is open to an objection which the defendants urge against it, in that it prohibits them from 'in any manner dealing with said lands, or any part thereof, without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior.' This prohibition would prevent them from selling their unrestricted interests, although that may not have been intended. It should be confined to the restricted undivided interests of the Indian owners; and we modify the decree accordingly.\n Subject to the modifications here made the decree is affirmed.\n Decree modified and affirmed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANG v. NEW YORK CENT R CO(1921)\nNo. 290\nArgued: March 1, 1921Decided: March 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hamilton Ward, of Buffalo, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Maurice C. Spratt, of Buffalo, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action for damages laid in the sum of $50,000 for injuries sustained by petitioner's intestate, Oscar G. Lang, while assisting in switching cars at Silver Creek, N. Y. The injuries resulted in death. The Safety Appliance Act (Comp. St.  8605-8612) is invoked as the law of recovery.\n There was a verdict for $18,000, upon which judgment was entered. It and the order denying a new trial were affirmed by the Appellate Division, March 5, 1918, by a divided court.\n The Court of Appeals reversed the judgments, and directed the complaint to be dismissed, to review which action this certiorari is directed.\n In general description the court said:\n'In the case before us the defendant [respondent] was engaged in interstate commerce. A car without a drawbar or coupler was standing on the siding. The plaintiff's intestate was a brakeman, and was riding on a second car kicked upon the same siding. A collision occurred, and the deceased was crushed between the car upon which he was riding and the defective car.'\n\n There is no dispute about the facts; there is dispute about the conclusions from them. We may quote, therefore, the statement of the trial court, passing upon the motion for new trial, as sufficient in its representation of the case. It is as follows:\n'The defendant had a loaded car loaded with iron which had been placed on a siding at the station at Silver Creek, N. Y. On the same track was also standing another car destined for Farnham, the \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n next station east. At Silver Creek this way freight had orders to leave a couple of cars and to take on the car going to Farnham. The car loaded with iron above referred to was defective. The drawbar, the draft timber, and the coupling apparatus on the westerly end of this car were gone. This car had been on the siding at Silver Creek several days, loaded with iron consigned to a firm at Silver Creek, waiting to be unloaded. Its condition was known to the crew of the way freight generally and to the plaintiff's intestate prior to the accident. In fact, its crippled condition was the subject of conversations between him and the train conductor only shortly before the accident happened. In getting out the car for Farnham, the engine went onto the siding from the westerly end, pulled out a string of six cars, including the Farnham car, then shunted the Farnham car onto an adjoining track, placed two of the other cars they had hauled out onto a third track, and then kicked the other three cars back onto the track where the crippled car stood. Plaintiff's intestate was on one of these three cars for the purpose of setting the brakes, and so placing them on this siding as not to come into contact with the crippled car. He evidently was at the brake on the easterly end of the easterly one of the three cars moving toward the crippled car. His foot was resting on the small platform at the end of the car just below the brake wheel. For some reason he did not stop the three cars moving on this track before the cars came into contact with the crippled car. The cars collided, and owing to the absence of coupler attachment and bumpers on the crippled car intestate's leg was caught between the ends of the two cars, and he was so injured that he died from the injuries so received. It evidently was not the intention of any of the crew to disturb, couple onto, or move the crippled car.'\n\n The statement that 'owing to the absence of the coupler attachment and bumpers on the crippled car intestate's \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n leg was caught between the ends of the two cars' is disputed as a consequence or as element of decision independently of what Lang was to do and did-indeed, it is the dispute in the case. Based on it, however, and the facts recited, the contention of petitioner is that they demonstrate a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, and justify the judgment of the trial court, and its affirmance by the Appellate Division. For this Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 U.S. 617\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 456 is cited.\n The opposing contention of respondent is that--\n'The proximate cause of the accident was the failure of the deceased to stop the cars before they came in collision with the defective car. The absence of the coupler and drawbar was not the proximate cause of the injury, nor was it a concurring cause.'\n\n To support the contention St. Louis & S. F. R. R. Co. v. Conarty, \n238 U.S. 243\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 785 is adduced.\n The Court of Appeals considered the Conarty Case controlling. This petitioner contests, and opposes to it the Layton Case, supra, and contends that the court failed to give significance and effect to the fact that the car in the Conarty Case was out of use, and that while out of use the car upon which Conarty was riding collided with it; whereas, in the case at bar, it is insisted, that the defective car was in use by defendant and was required to be used by the intestate. The trial court made this distinction and expressed the view that the defective car in the case at bar 'must be deemed to have been in use within the meaning of the statute.' The distinction as we shall presently see is not justified. It is insisted upon, however, and to what is considered its determination is added a citation from the Layton Case declaring that the Safety Appliance Act makes 'it unlawful for any carrier engaged in interstate commerce to use on its railroad any car not' equipped as there provided, and, further, 'by this legislation the qualified duty of the common carrier is expanded \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 459]\n\u00a0\n into an absolute duty in respect to car couplers,' and by an omission of the duty the carrier incurs 'a liability to make compensation to any employee who' is 'injured by it.' But necessarily there must be a causal relation between the fact of delinquency and the fact of injury and so the case declares. Its concluding words are, expressing the condition of liability, 'that carriers are liable to employees in damages whenever the failure to obey these safety appliance laws is the proximate cause of injury to them when engaged in the discharge of duty.' The plaintiff recovered because the case came, it was said, within that interpretation of the statute.\n We need not comment further upon the case, nor consider the cases which it cites. There is no doubt of the duty of a carrier under the statute, and its imperative requirement, or of the consequences of its omission. But the inquiry necessarily occurs, to what situation, and when, and to what employees do they apply?\n The Court of Appeals was of the view that it was the declaration of the Conarty Case that section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act1 'was intended to provide against the risk of coupling and uncoupling and to obviate the necessity of men going between the ends of cars. It was not to provide a place of safety between colliding cars' and that 'the absence of coupler and drawbar was not a breach of duty toward a servant in that situation.' It further decided that Land was in 'that situation,' and he 'was not one of the persons for whose benefit the Safety Appliance Act was passed.' \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 460]\n\u00a0\n Two questions are hence presented for solution: (1) Was the Court of Appeals' estimate of the Conarty Case correct? (2) Was it properly applied to Lang's situation?\n\n\n (1)\n The court's conclusion that the requirement of the Safety Appliance Act 'was intended to provide against the risk of coupling cars' is the explicit declaration of the Conarty Case. There, after considering the act and the cases in exposition of it, we said:\n Nothing in its provisions 'gives any warrant for saying that they are intended to provide a place of safety between colliding cars. On the contrary, they affirmatively show that a principal purpose in their enactment was to obviate 'the necessity for men going between the ends of the cars.' 27 Stat. 531.'\n The case was concerned with a collision between a switch engine and a defective freight car resulting in injuries from which death ensued. The freight car was about to be placed on (we quote from the opinion)--\n'an isolated track for repairs and was left near the switch leading to that track while other cars were being moved out of the way-a task taking about five minutes. At that time a switch engine with which the deceased was working came along the track on which the car was standing and the collision ensued.'\n\n The deceased was on the switch engine and it was on its way--\n'to do some switching at a point some distance beyond the car and was not intended and did not attempt to couple it to the engine or to handle it in any way. Its movement was in the hands of others.'\n\n\n (2)\n That case, therefore, declares the same principle of decision as the Court of Appeals declared in this, and, while there is some difference in the facts, the difference does not exclude the principle. In neither case was the movement of the colliding car directed to a movement of the defective car. In that case the movement of the colliding car was at night, and it may be inferred that there was no knowledge of the situation of the defective car. In \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 461]\n\u00a0\n this case the movement of the colliding car was in the daytime and the situation of the defective car was not only known and visible, but its defect was known by Lang. He therefore knew that his attention and efforts were to be directed to prevent contact with it. He had no other concern with it than to avoid it. 'It was not,' the trial court said, 'the intention of any of the crew [of the colliding car] to disturb, couple onto, or move the crippled car.' It was the duty of the crew, we repeat, and immediately the duty of Lang, to stop the colliding car and to set the brakes upon it 'so as not to come into contact with the crippled car,' to quote again from the trial court. That duty he failed to perform, and, if it may be said that notwithstanding he would not have been injured if the car collided with had been equipped with drawbar and coupler, we answer, as the Court of Appeals answered, 'still the collision was not the proximate result of the defect,' or, in other words, and as expressed in effect in the Conarty Case, that the collision under the evidence cannot be attributable to a violation of the provisions of the law 'but only that, had they been complied with, it [the collision] would not have resulted in injury to the deceased.'\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE (dissenting).\n Because I think that the court's decision of this case will result in seriously confusing the law applicable to the Safety Appliance Acts of Congress, I shall state, as briefly as I may, my reasons for dissenting from it.\n When Lang, a brakeman in the employ of the New York Central Railroad Company, received his fatal injuries, the Safety Appliance Acts of Congress declared it to be 'unlawful' for an interstate carrier by rail to 'use on its line' any car not equipped with automatic couplers, and also \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 462]\n\u00a0\n provided that any employee injured by any car not so equipped should not be held to have assumed the risk of injury thereby occasioned by continuing to work after the unlawful use of such a car had been brought to his knowledge. 27 Stat. 531,  2 and 8 (Comp. St.  8606, 8612); 32 Stat. 943,  1 (Comp. St.  8613).\n At that time, also, the federal Employers' Liability Act provided that in any action brought under the act no employee should be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence or to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by the carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of its employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee. 35 Stat. 65,  3 and 4 (Comp. St.  8659, 8660).\n It is obvious that these statutes take out of this case all question as to assumption of risk by, and contributory negligence of, the deceased brakeman.\n Since the decision in St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 295\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 616, 621 (52 L. Ed. 1061) this court has consistently held that in enacting the Safety Appliance Acts:\n'The obvious purpose of the Legislature was to supplant the qualified duty of the common law with an absolute duty deemed by it more just. If the railroad does, in point of fact, use cars which do not comply with the standard, it violates the plain prohibitions of the law, and there arises from that violation the liability to make compensation to one who is injured by it.'\n\n Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 559\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 612: Here the court declares that the Safety Appliance Act imposes 'an absolute duty on the carrier and the penalty cannot be escaped by the exercise of reasonable care.'\n Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 U.S. 33\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 482: Here the court said:\n'Disregard of the Safety Appliance Act is a wrongful act; and, where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit it was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default in implied.' \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 463]\n\u00a0\n Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617, 621\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 456, 457 (61 L. Ed. 931): Here the foregoing cases are cited, and the court declares:\n\n'While it is undoubtedly true that the immediate occasion for passing the laws requiring automatic couplers was the great number of deaths and injuries caused to employees who were obliged to go between cars to couple and uncouple them, yet these laws as written are by no means confined in their terms to the protection of employees only when so engaged. The language of the acts and the authorities we have cited make it entirely clear that the liability in damages to employees for failure to comply with the law springs from its being made unlawful to use cars not equipped as required,-not from the position the employee may be in or the work which he may be doing at the moment when he is injured. This effect can be given to the acts and their wise and humane purpose can be accomplished only by holding, as we do, that carriers are liable to employees in damages whenever the failure to obey these safety appliance laws is the proximate cause of injury to them when engaged in the discharge of duty.'\n\n Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Gotschall, \n244 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 598. Here a brakeman, going over the tops of cars when a train was in motion, was thrown under the wheels by a sudden jerk caused by the setting of brakes when defective couplers parted, and the company was held liable 'in view of the positive duty imposed by the statute to furnish safe appliances for the coupling of cars.'\n Regarding the case at bar as ruled by the decisions we have cited, especially by Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Layton, supra, the trial court held the railroad company liable and sent the case to the jury for the assessment of damages only. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed it, solely upon the authority of St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Co. v. Conarty, \n238 U.S. 243\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 785. \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 464]\n\u00a0\n It is plain that the principle of the cases quoted from is that carriers should be held liable to employees in damages whenever failure to obey the Safety Appliance Laws is the proximate cause of the injury to them when engaged in the discharge of their duty.\n With these statutes and decisions in mind we come to the consideration of the facts in this case.\n Lang, a brakeman, was a member of the crew of a local freight train, running from Erie, Pa., easterly to Buffalo, N. Y. When the train reached Silver Creek, an intermediate station, the conductor was directed to pick up a car then on the 'house track,' and to take it in his train to Farnham, N. Y. We shall refer to this car as the 'Farnham car.'\n For more than two weeks prior to the accident to Lang, there had been in the Silver Creek yard a box car loaded with steel, from one end of which, for three or four days before the accident certainly (how much longer does not appear) the entire coupler and draw bar had been missing. This car had been held for unloading, which had been commenced before but was completed on the day of the accident. It had been necessary during this time to switch the car about the yard, and the crew of which Lang was a member had shifted it at least once on the day before the accident.\n When the conductor went to look for the Farnham car he found it standing on the 'house track' with five other cars to the west of it and four cars to the east of it, the car next it on the east being the defective car, with the drawhead missing from its west end (the end next the Farnham car). Thus this 'house track,' with capacity for 12 cars, had 10 standing upon it, of which the defective car was one-necessarily they must have been very close together.\n The conductor saw that it was impossible to switch out the Farnham car from the east end of the 'house track' \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 465]\n\u00a0\n without moving the defective car, and thereupon he ordered his engine to go through the switch at the west end of the 'house track,' to couple to the six cars standing to the west of the defective car, and then to back out and switch the Farnham car (which would be the most easterly one of the string) onto another track, where it could be picked up later. This being done, the two cars farthest from the engine were shunted onto a third track, thus leaving but three cars attached to the engine. The plan then was to 'kick' these three cars back onto the 'house track,' and to stop them when near to the defective car, but before they came in contact with it. It was while attempting to accomplish this purpose that the accident occurred.\n The movement which resulted in the accident is described by the conductor, who was standing at the switch at the west end of the 'house track,' as follows:\n The engine kicked the three remaining cars onto the 'house track,' and after they were started Lang, who was standing near the conductor, got on the head car, 'the one nearest to the cripple,' for the purpose of stopping them. When he got upon this box car, it was about four car lengths from the defective end of the defective car, and the track was slightly down grade toward it. His purpose was to get to the brake at the head end of the head car, so as to stop the three before they touched the defective car, but either because the cars had been started too rapidly by the engine, or because the brake did not work well, or because the track was down grade, or because the time or distance was too short, he did not get the cars stopped in time to prevent them from colliding with the defective car. At the moment of the impact, Lang, who was in the act of setting the brakes, had one foot on the brake step attached to the end of the head car, and, because the drawhead was missing from the defective car, the ends of the two cars came together, so crushing his leg between them that he died \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 466]\n\u00a0\n within a few days thereafter. Thus did Lang, who was as much without fault in fact as the statutes cited rendered him without fault in law, come to his death.\n It is the uncontradicted evidence that, if the bad order car had been equipped with such a coupler as the law required, the ends of the two cars could not have come nearer together than 30 inches, and the accident, of course, could not have occurred.\n It seems to be the theory of the opinion of the court that because the conductor realized the danger there was in the defective car and aimed to avoid moving it, therefore it was not 'in use' by the company within the meaning of the Safety Appliance Acts.\n But a car in such dangerously defective condition as this one was, which for convenience in unloading was kept for days, perhaps for weeks, in a yard so crowded that it was necessary to move it from time to time in the ordinary yard switching, cannot reasonably be said to have been 'out of use' during that time. To allow such a car to be placed upon an unloading track, so short and crowded that a slight excess of speed in moving other cars, or a slight defect in the brakes or a moment of delay in applying them, might result, as it did in this case, in the injury or death of employees, cannot reasonably be said to be keeping such a car 'out of use.' As a matter of fact, the defective car was actually in use in a most real and familiar way on the very day of the accident, for, on that day the unloading of it, which had been commenced before, was completed while it was on the 'house track' on which the accident occurred.\n The Layton Case, supra, coming after the Conarty Case, decided (all the members of this court as now consituted concurring) that:\n'Carriers are liable to employees in damages whenever the failure to obey these safety appliance laws is the proximate cause of injury to them when in the discharge of duty.'\n\n And the Gotschall Case, \n244 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 598, \n\n[255 U.S. 455, 467]\n\u00a0\n CLEARLY PROCEEDED UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLE. neither of the men injured in the Layton or Gotschall Cases was engaged in coupling or uncoupling cars when the accident occurred, but each was injured because of defective coupling appliances when he was going over the cars of his train in the discharge of his duty. Here Lang was injured, when in the discharge of his duty, because a defective car had been placed upon a much-used track in a busy yard in such a position that it was impossible for him, in the exercise of due care, to prevent the cars he was seeking to control from coming in contact with it.\n It would be difficult to conceive of a case in which the negligence of the master could be a more immediate and proximate cause of injury to a servant than it was in this case.\n Having regard to the extent to which this case must be accepted by other courts as a rule of decision, it would seem that the orderly and intelligible administration of justice required that the principle of the Layton and Gotschall Cases should be disavowed or overruled, for that principle is so plainly in conflict with the opinion in this case that courts and advising counsel will otherwise be left without any rule to guide them in the disposition of the many similar cases constantly pressing for disposition.\n For the reasons thus stated, I think the judgment of the Court of Appeals entered by the Supreme Court of New York should be reversed, and the original judgment of the Supreme Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act is as follows: 'On and after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier [one engaged in interstate commerce] to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' 27 Stat. 531 (Comp.

Brown, of St. Joseph, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. Petrus Peterson, of Lincoln, Neb., for respondent. \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Following our decision in Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. v. City of Lincoln et al. (June 2, 1919) \n250 U.S. 256\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 454, our mandate went down to the District Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska, reciting our determination that its decree of September 23, 1915, should be modified as indicated in the opinion, and as so modified should be affirmed with costs, and proceeding as follows:\n'You, therefore, are hereby commanded that such execution and proceedings be had in said cause as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said appeal notwithstanding.'\n\n Upon the filing of this mandate, the District Court, on January 6, 1920, entered an order modifying its decree of September 23, 1915, as particularly required, and, at the same time, made an order retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of requiring the company to make refund and restitution to consumers of gas for all amounts collected over and above the legal rate pending the litigation, with interest, in accordance with the terms of a bond that the company had filed in the cause in order to obtain a supersedeas, with a continuance of injunction, pending its appeal from the decree of September 23, 1915. An appeal from the order retaining jurisdiction, taken by the company to this court, was dismissed because the order lacked finality. \n253 U.S. 477\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 585. The mandate upon the dismissal again commanded the District Court:\n'That such proceedings be had in said cause, as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said appeal notwithstanding.'\n\n This having gone down, the court appointed a master, with direction to examine the books and accounts of the company and prepare an account of the amounts paid by consumers in excess of the ordinance rates during the pendency of any restraining order or injunction in the \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 514]\n\u00a0\n cause, with other provisions not necessary to be mentioned.\n The company applied to this court, obtained leave for the purpose, and filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to command the judge of the District Court to nullify and revoke the above-mentioned orders and refrain from assuming jurisdiction over the cause as aforesaid. An order to show cause was is sued, proper return thereto made by the judge, and the matter has been argued.\n From the petition and return the following additional particulars appear: The original suit was commenced December 27, 1906, in the United States Circuit (now District) Court, by the company against the city and its officials as defendants seeking (among other things) to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance regulating the price to be charged for gas. At the outset a restraining order was obtained, and this was followed by a temporary injunction, continued in force until final decree, and afterwards, pending an appeal to this court (\n223 U.S. 349\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 271), under a bond conditioned to account for overcharges if the rate ordinance should be sustained. After this first appeal, the litigation was continued until September 23, 1915, when the District Court made a final decree sustaining the rate ordinance and dismissing the bill. An application for allowance of an appeal to this court, with a supersedeas to keep the injunction in effect, was granted November 22, 1915, upon approval of a supersedeas bond tendered by the company for the purpose, in the penal sum of $575,000, to be paid to the clerk of the District Court for the benefit of all gas consumers who had purchased gas from the company during the pendency of the action from its commencement, and all consumers who should purchase gas thereafter until the final determination of the suit, with a condition reciting the decree of September 23, 1915, and the temporary injunction theretofore granted to restrain the putting into effect \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n of the rate ordinance, and providing that if the company should prosecute its appeal to effect, or failing to make its appeal good should answer all costs and damages and refund all overcharges collected from gas consumers above the price fixed by said ordinance, and should pay to the clerk of the District Court or his successor in office, for the benefit of all whom it might concern and in particular for the benefit of all consumers entitled to refunds, all overcharges collected since the granting of the original injunction, together with interest thereon, when the several parties lawfully entitled and the amount of refund due to each should have been ascertained in the action in such manner as the court should direct, the determination to be binding upon all parties to the bond, then the obligation should be void, otherwise to remain in force.\n This appeal resulted in our decision of June 2, 1919, affirming the decree, with two modifications, one of which related to an occupation tax that was under attack in the same suit, but is not now material; the other was, to cause the dismissal of the suit as to the rate ordinance to be without prejudice to the commencement of a new action thereafter to restrain enforcement of the ordinance if it could be shown to be confiscatory in its effect under the new conditions.\n Thus it appears that, during the entire course of this protracted litigation (except for a period when the company put the prescribed rate into effect as a test), the operation of the ordinance was suspended at the instance of the company, upon terms obliging it and its surety to refund all overcharges should it fail to make good its attack upon the established rate, and binding it to abide by the determination of the court in the same cause as to the amounts due, and pay the entire amount thus ascertained, with interest, to the clerk of the court, for the benefit of the consumers. According to the company's \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 516]\n\u00a0\n own statement, its books showing the accounts between it and its customers during the period from 1906 to 1920 contain more than 25,000 accounts, which are involved and complicated by other charges, so that an examination of them would involve much time and expense.\n The principal contention upon which the petition for mandamus is rested is that, under our mandate following the decision of June 2, 1919, and the more recent one on dismissal of the subsequent appeal, no jurisdiction was conferred upon the District Court to take any action except to affirm its decree of September 23, 1915, dismissing the bill of complaint, after modifying the decree in the two particulars specified. It is said that, after an appeal, the court below has jurisdiction to proceed only in conformity with the direction of the mandate of the appellate court. This may be conceded. But here our mandate expressly commanded 'that such execution and proceedings be had in said cause as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said appeal notwithstanding.' Of course, whatever proceedings were taken thereafter in the same cause would be further proceedings; and the absence of the particular word 'further' from the mandate is of no consequence. Emphatically the command called for proceedings in the nature of execution according to right and justice and the laws of the United States. The necessary meaning is that the court below should proceed to carry our decision into full effect according to right and justice; and, manifestly this could not be done without proceeding to enforce the supersedeas bond according to its terms. The bond recognized that the city and its officials, who were the nominal parties defendant, were in a broad sense the representatives of the consumers, the parties actually concerned. It recognized that they were required to pay a rate for gas higher than the city \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 517]\n\u00a0\n ordinance had determined to be just and reasonable; that these excess charges were being exacted pending the suit, in order that the company might be secure in the event that it should prevail, and, per contra, that they ought to be refunded with interest in the event that it should fail. It recognized that the consumers were so many in number, and the difficulty of sustaining their individual claims through separate suits would be so great, that to remit them to such suits would be a virtual denial of justice. And it recognized that to ascertain what should be due to them, to see to its collection from the company in case of its failure to make good its attack upon the ordinance, and to cause distribution to be made among the several claimants, was essential to the doing of complete equity, and therefore a natural incident to the jurisdiction of the court in the main cause. To retain jurisdiction for the purpose of requiring that restitution be made according to the terms of the bond was and is a necessary part of the duty of the District Court under the mandate.\n The case is within the principle of Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 U.S. 134\n, 143-147, 39 Sup. Ct. 237.\n The contention that the jurisdiction fails because the consumers were not parties to the record, nor in privity with the parties, and the company prayed no relief against them, is transparently unsound. The ordinance was intended to limit the gas rate for the benefit of the consumers; suit was brought against the municipality and its officers as the public representatives of the interests of the consumers; the restraining order and temporary injunction were intended for the very purpose of enabling the company to exact, pending the suit, rates in excess of those limited by the ordinance; the equitable duty to refund excess charges if the suit should fail was a duty owing to the consumers; and the form of the supersedeas \n\n[256 U.S. 512, 518]\n\u00a0\n bond recognized all this, and was particularly designed for their protection.\n Nor is there substance in the contention that the jurisdiction does not extend to overcharges subsequent to September 23, 1915. The thought suggested is, that the adjudication of the validity of the ordinance did not extend beyond the date of the final decree; that thereafter changed conditions, increased costs, and other circumstances referred to by us in \n250 U.S. 268\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 454, may have rendered the limited rate noncompensatory, and the ordinance therefore confiscatory; and that at least the company, before being called upon to make restitution, ought to have a hearing upon this question as to the period subsequent to September 23, 1915. The contention overlooks the effect of the ordinance, which is presumptively valid, and has continuing force unless and until set aside by judicial decree as the result of an investigation, in which the burden of proof is upon the company; that the decree of September 23, 1915, is conclusive evidence that the company has made such an attempt, and has failed, and that the ordinance rate not only is lawful and binding, but will so continue unless and until the company, under the 'without prejudice' clause, shall begin a new suit and maintain its contention that the rate through changed conditions has become noncompensatory. See Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 715. The contention also overlooks the fact that the bond itself was given subsequent to the decree appealed from, in terms for the benefit not only of gas consumers who theretofore had purchased gas from the company, but of those who should purchase thereafter at any time before the final determination of the suit.

Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Louisiana & Pine Bluff Railway Company, a common carrier owned by the Union Sawmill Company, serves it by means of a tap line which connects its mill at Huttig, Ark., with the Missouri Pacific Railway at Dollar Junction. The trunk line and the tap line joined in establishing through routes and joint rates from the mill to points on the trunk line and beyond. The division or allowance given to the tap line out of the joint rates was large. It was held by the Interstate Commerce Commission to amount to a rebate to the Union Sawmill Company and to discriminate unjustly against the Wisconsin Lumber Company, an independent concern also served by the tap line. \n1\n After proceedings before the Commission, which extended over many years, its supplemental order, entered June 10, 1919, limited the division receivable by the tap line for hauling lumber from the Union Sawmills \n\n[257 U.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n to Dollar Junction to $3 per car. \n2\n The Louisiana & Pine Bluff Railway Company then brought this suit in the federal District Court for Western Arkansas against the United States to enjoin enforcement of the order and to annul the same. The bill charged that the order deprived plaintiff of property without due process of law, that it discriminated against plaintiff by denying to it the same compensation which other carriers were allowed to charge for like service, and that the Commission was without authority in law or fact to make the order complained of. The Interstate Commerce Commission intervened. Answers setting forth the proceedings taken were filed, and by consent of parties, the case was submitted for final hearing upon the pleadings. The District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill, and the case comes here on appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220.\n No claim is made here that the division allowed is so low as to be confiscatory. No claim is made that there was lack of notice or of opportunity to be heard before the Commission, or that the proceedings before it were otherwise irregular. Nor could a claim that the order was unsupported by evidence be insisted upon. For only a part of the evidence taken before the Commission was introduced. Manufacturers' Railway Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383; Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 125\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 466. The claim now urged is that the order was arbitrary and so unreasonable that it should be set aside.\n After the decision in the Tap Line Cases, \n234 U.S. 1\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 741, the Commission made, in respect to each of the many tap line \n\n[257 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n companies which were party to the proceeding, an order, 40 Interst. Com. Com'n, 470, like that sustained in O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 U.S. 294\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 313. By these orders the maximum division to a tap line for hauling a car from the mill to the junction with the trunk line for a distance of not more than 3 miles was fixed at $3. For a distance over 3 and not more than 6 miles the division to the tap line was fixed at 1 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds, or approximately $9 a car. The plaintiff contends that it should be allowed to receive the division of 1 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds, on the ground that its haul from the Union Sawmill plants to Dollar Junction was longer than 3 miles. Cars loaded with lumber at the platforms of the Union Sawmills, if hauled direct to Dollar Junction, would travel only 2.41 miles. But they are not hauled direct to the junction; they are taken first in the opposite direction to a track scale located on and controlled by the trunk line. Because of this fact the distance actually travelled is 3.42 miles. The Commission, interpreting its own order, directed that for this service the plaintiff could not be allowed by the trunk line more than $3. The contention is that weighing the car is an integral part of the transportation service ( In re Weighing of Freight by Carriers, 28 Interst. Com. Com'n, 7; Detroit Coal Exchange v. Michigan Central R. R. Co., 38 Interst. Com. Com'n, 79), and that to refuse to make an allowance for the out of line haul is arbitrary and so unreasonable as to invalidate the order. For the haul from the Wisconsin Lumber Company's mill to Dollar Junction, which is 3.24 miles in the direct line, the Commission authorized the division to the plaintiff of 1 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds.\n The contention that the order is invalid ignores both the nature of the proceeding before the Commission and the findings upon which the order was made. The proceeding was one to remove unjust discrimination. The Commission's decision is based upon a consideration both \n\n[257 U.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n of general conditions and of the particular situation. It finds that allowance of more than $3 a car for hauling the car from the Union Sawmill plant to Dollar Junction would result in unjust discrimination. That the finding was supported by evidence we must assume in this proceeding; and not only does plaintiff fail to show that the conclusion reached was arbitrary, but additional findings in the report afford abundant reason why the out of line haul to the scales should not be allowed for in fixing the division. The Commission finds (53 Interst. Com. Com'n, 475, 476) that 'the evidence does not show that it is necessary that the shipments be weighed by the tap line rather than by the trunk line,' and (40 Interst. Com. Com'n, 470, 471) that allowing the larger division on these facts would place the plaintiff in a more advantageous position than any other tap line in that territory performing a similar service and would 'open the way in the case of many tap lines for a relocation of their track scales, so as to require a long back haul, and in that way to lay a basis for divisions or allowances very materially in excess of those fixed by the Commission for the distance covered by a direct movement from the mill to the junction'; in other words, divisions that would operate as rebates.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See The Tap Line Case, 23 Interst.

OF INDIANA(1921)\nNo. 186\nArgued: January 27, 1921Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. William H. Thompson, of Indianapolis, Ind., and Henry W. Moore, of Terre Haute, Ind., for appellant. \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. M. White, of Indianapolis, Ind., and John A. Riddle, of Vincennes, Ind., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, the Lower Vein Coal Company, is a corporation of the state of Indiana. The Industrial Board of Indiana is a board created by an act of the General Assembly of Indiana, approved March 8, 1915, known as 'the Indiana Workmen's Compensation Act.' Laws 1915, c. 106. The personal appellees are members of the board.\n This suit was brought by the Coal Company to enjoin the Industrial Board, the Governor and Attorney General of the state, from enforcing in any manner section 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state, as amended by the General Assembly in 1919 (Laws 1919, c. 57), from asserting that plaintiff is compelled to operate under the Compensation Act, from hearing any claim for compensation asserted by any employe of the plaintiff so long as plaintiff elects not to come within the provisions of the act from making any award to any injured employe, or his or her dependents, during such time, and from doing any other act or thing prejudicial to the rights of the plaintiff, so long as it elects not to be bound by the act.\n The grounds for this relief were set forth in a complaint of considerable length to which the defendants separately and severally answered. After trial of the issues thus presented the District Court entered its decree dismissing the bill for want of equity. This appeal was then prosecuted.\n The Compensation Act is very long and declares its purposes to be to promote the prevention of industrial \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n accidents; to cause provision to be made for adequate medical and surgical care for injured employes in the course of their employment; to provide methods of insuring the payment of such compensation; to create an Industrial Board for the administration of the act and to prescribe the powers and duties of such board; to abolish the state Bureau of Inspection, and provide for the transfer to the Industrial Board certain rights, powers and duties of the Bureau of Inspection.\n The original act passed in 1915 was elective and left employer and employe the option of rejecting its terms with certain exceptions. It was amended in 1917 (Laws 1917, c. 165), and railroad employes engaged in train service were exempted from its provisions.\n The amendment of 1919 made the act mandatory as to all coal-mining companies of the state and its political divisions and as to municipal corporations. To all other employers the act remains permissive. They may elect to operate under its provisions. Railroad employes engaged in train service are not within them.\n The sole question presented is the validity of section 18 as amended; that is, the compulsion of coal companies to the operation of the act, while to other employers it is permissive, or does not apply at all. The grounds of attack upon it are that it violates the due process clause and the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and sections 21 and 23 of the Indiana Bill of Rights. Specifically, the question is, as the Coal Company expresses it:\n'Whether the Indiana General Assembly may pass a general compensation law, applicable to all employers within the state, and make it compulsory as to one hazardous employment, and elective as to all others (many equally as hazardous) except railroad employes in train service to which it does not apply at all.'\n\n And the insistence is 'that such a classification rests upon no \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n sound or just basis,' and hence is inimical to the Constitution of the United States and that of Indiana.\n The principle of law involved and the power of a state to distinguish and classify objects in its legislation have been too often declared, too abundantly and variously illustrated, to need repetition and we pass immediately to the contention of counsel. It is that the act is addressed to hazardous employments and where in employments that character exists, sameness exists, and a law which ignores such sameness discriminates in its operation and offends the Constitution of the United States. It may be that the Coal Company does not contend for so broad a principle but may assert protection by a comparison of its business with other businesses equally hazardous, or even more hazardous than coal mining, and that necessarily the exemption of the businesses so compared from the law taints it with illegal discrimination. To support and justify the comparison, statistics of accidents are given in the complaint, and in the number of accidental injuries coal mines are made to run fifth. Notwithstanding those other companies may go in or out of the law-coal- mining companies must stay.\n The answer replies with counter assertions and statistics and a detail of the methods of coal mining and what their methods cause of accidents to the miners, and to these are added it is said, the risks that come from the generation of noxious and explosive gases. And there is evidence in the case addressed to the conflicting statistics and the conclusions to be deduced from them which occupies about ninety-three pages of the record. In this evidence occupations and businesses are compared with estimates of accidents in each and their character, severity and consequences, fatal and otherwise. There is also testimony of the wages that mine workers get and of their prosperity, and that they have a legal department and paid attorneys. And there is averment and testimony \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n of two organizations of mine owners who retain officers and attorneys to defend suits and secure releases from personal injury claims.\n The length and character of the reports and tables of statistics preclude summary. It may be conceded that different deductions may be made from them, but they and the controversies over them and what they justified or demanded of remedy were matters for the legislative judgment and that judgment is not open to judicial review. Indeed, there may be a comprehension of effects and practical influences that cannot be presented to a court and measured by it, and which it may be the duty of government to promote or resist, or deemed advisable to do so. Degrees of policies if they have bases are not for our consideration and the bases cannot be judged of by abstract speculations or the controversies of opinion. Legislation is impelled and addressed to concrete conditions deemed or demonstrated to be obstacles to something better, and the better, it may be, having attainment or prospect in different occupations (we say occupations as this case is concerned with them) dependent in the legislative consideration upon their distinctions in some instances, upon their identities in others, and as the case may be, associated or separated in regulation. And this is the rationale of the principle of classification and of the cases which are at once the results and illustrations of it.\n There are facts of especial pertinence that make the principle apply in the present case and justify the legislation of the state. That coal mining has peculiar conditions has been quite universally recognized and declared. It has been recognized and declared by this court and is manifested in the laws of the states where coal mining obtains. There is something in this universal sense and its impulse to special legislation- enough certainly to remove such legislation from the charge of being an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of power. \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n The action of the Coal Company indicates that it considered the coal business distinctive. Other businesses though according to the Coal Company's assertion as hazardous as coal mining, accepted the law, the Coal Company and other coal companies rejected it. To this, of course, the coal companies were induced by comparison of advantages but the inducements to reject the legislation might well have been the inducement to make it compulsory. At any rate, there is, taking that and all other matters into consideration, grounds for the legislative judgment expressed in the amendment of 1919 under consideration, that is, section 18 as amended. And the fact is to be borne in mind that there are 30,000 employes in the state engaged in coal mining.\n The Coal Company further contends that the law includes within its terms all the company's employes whether engaged in the hazardous part of its business or not so engaged. In other words, it asserts that the conditions of those who work underground may justify the law but do not justify its application to those who work above ground. The contention has a certain speciousness but cannot be entertained. It commits the law and its application to distinctions that might be very confusing in its administration and subjects it and the controversies that may arise under it to various tests of facts and this against the same company. The contention is answered in effect by Booth v. State of Indiana, \n237 U.S. 391\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 617\n\n\n Appellant invokes against the law sections 21 and 23 of the Indiana Bill of Rights which respectively provide that no man's property or particular services shall be taken without just compensation, nor except in the case of the state, without compensation being first assessed and tendered, nor shall there be a grant of privileges to any citizen or class of citizens that shall not belong to all citizens.\n Appellant, however, while admitting, indeed, citing \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n cases to show that the classification of objects of legislation under the Bill of Rights of the state has the same bases of power and purposes as the classification of objects under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, yet contends that the Supreme Court of the state has strictly construed the Bill of Rights of the state, and has observed a precision in classification not required or practised in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment-citing for this Indianapolis T. & T. Co. v. Kinney, 171 Ind. 612, 617, 85 N. E. 954, 23 L. R. A. (N. S.) 711; Cleveland, etc., R. R. Co. v. Foland, 174 Ind. 411, 91 N. E. 594, 92 N. E. 165; Richey v. Cleveland, etc., R. R. Co., 176 Ind. 542, at page 558, 96 N. E. 694, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 121.\n These cases were constructions of the Employers' Liability Act of the state. It was held in Indianapolis T. & T. Co. v. Kinney, supra, that that act was constitutional as to railroads because it related 'to the peculiar hazards inherent in the use and operation of' them, and only applied to employes operating trains. It is the contention of the Coal Company that it is a deduction from that decision and the others cited, which may be said to be of the same effect, that there must be a difference observed between employes of coal-mining companies as they are or are not engaged in the hazardous part of the business, and as that distinction is not observed in the Compensation Act it infringes the Bill of Rights of the state because it is made compulsory 'upon coal-mining companies with respect to their employes not engaged in the hazardous part of the business, and as to all other private business enterprises within the state, except railroad employes in train service, which are excluded, it is purely optional.'\n The argument in support of the contention is that the act requires all employes in the coal-mining business to be paid compensation under the act whether employed above ground or under ground, that is, whether hazardously employed or otherwise, whereas in the cited cases, \n\n[255 U.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n it is insisted, the court considered such employment as a material distinction and that legislation which disregarded it would have unconstitutional discrimination.\n The contention only has strength by regarding Employers' Liability Acts and Workmen's Compensation Acts as practically identical in the public policy respectively involved in them and in effect upon employer and employe. This we think is without foundation. They both provided for reparation of injuries to employes but differ in manner and effect, and there is something more in a compensation law than the element of hazard, something that gives room for the power of classification which a Legislature may exercise in its judgment of what is necessary for the public welfare, to which we have adverted, and which cannot be pronounced arbitrary because it may be disputed and 'opposed by argument and opinion of serious strength.'

Thereupon the latter instituted this proceeding for an injunction upon the ground, among others, that as the building was lawfully erected the ordinance violated the federal Constitution.\n The court below, following Bancroft v. Goldberg, Bowen & Co., 166 Cal. 416, 137 Pac. 18, held that the building was erected in 1906 within the fire limits theretofore prescribed in violation of valid local regulations duly enacted under the charter, and consequently there could be no reasonable doubt of the municipality's power to direct its removal. \n\n[255 U.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n The meaning and effect of the charter and ordinances thereunder are questions of local law determination of which by the state courts we commonly accept as conclusive. It is admitted that the building was constructed within defined fire limits, and the Supreme Court of the state has said this was contrary to valid regulations then in force.

C., for appellant. \n\n[254 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank Davis, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Essential findings of fact by the Court of Claims in this case are as follows:\n On January 23, 1863, John H. Hamiter, of Arkansas, sold 175 bales of cotton to the government of the Confederate States and executed and delivered a bill of sale, containing this paragraph:\n'The undersigned having sold to the Confederate States of America, and received the value of same in bonds, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, 175 bales of cotton, marked, numbered, and classed as in the margin, which is now deposited at my plantation, hereby agrees to take due care of said cotton whilst on his plantation, and to deliver the same as [at] his own expense at Conway, on Red river, in the state of Arkansas, to the order of the Secretary of the Treasury, or his agents or their assigns.'\n\n The payment in bonds not being made, 'five or six months later' Hamiter notified the agent of the government that if they were not delivered, he would treat the sale as rescinded, and, the bonds not being forthcoming, he sold the cotton to his father, who died not long thereafter.\n About two years later, in September, 1865, Hamiter, 'as administrator or other agent of his father's estate,' sold 70 bales of the cotton to plaintiff's decedent, then Mrs. Trigg (afterwards Mrs. Pillow), and received pay for it. Mrs. Pillow sent it to the Red river for shipment to market, where it was seized by the United States Treasury agents, under authority of 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property,' etc., approved March 12, 1863, 12 Stat. 820, c. 120. It was sold, and \n\n[254 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n for the proceeds paid into the United States Treasury Mrs. Pillow, since deceased, instituted this action.\n The Court of Claims dismissed the petition without an opinion, probably because it deemed the showing of title to the cotton by the claimant's decedent so obviously insufficent as not to require discussion.\n The only warrant for such a suit at this late day is found in section 162 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1153), and to entitle the claimant to recover he must prove that his decedent was the owner of the cotton at the time it was seized. Thompson v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 547, 549\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 349.\n There is no finding by the Court of Claims that Mrs. Pillow was the owner of the cotton when it was seized, but it is argued that facts are found which require that conclusion. These are: that Hamiter owned the cotton, that he sold it to Mrs. Pillow who paid for it, and that after she took possession of it the government seized it. It is argued that these facts show title in her, which was not divested by anything afterwards done by her, and therefore the claim of her representative for the proceeds of the cotton should be allowed.\n Other facts found, however, on which we must proceed to judgment are: That Hamiter sold the cotton to the Confederate States government, and when it was not paid for declared the sale void and then sold it to his father; that afterwards, 'as administrator or other agent of his father's estate,' he sold it to Mrs. Pillow; and that after she had failed to secure its release by the United States government, she demanded that Hamiter should refund to her the purchase price. This demand at first Hamiter refused, but 'upon fear of threatened arrest and punishment for his transactions in connection with the cotton,' he consented, gave his note to Mrs. Pillow for the amount of the purchase price and filed a claim for the cotton in his own name which was disallowed. Thus Hamiter obviously thought the contract in form a sale had been \n\n[254 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n rescinded by mutual consent, and that Mrs. Pillow was of the same conviction is shown by the fact that when Hamiter's note at six months was not paid she sued him upon it, but 'it does not satisfactorily appear what was the result of the suit.'\n The natural and impressive inference from these facts is, not that Mrs. Pillow obtained from Hamiter a good title to the cotton and a right to the proceeds of it, but that these two persons, parties to the sale, who were 50 years nearer to it than courts can now be placed and who knew more about it than it is possible now to learn, agreed that it should be rescinded because of the prior 'transactions of Hamiter in connection with the cotton,' which must mean that the title which he was able to confer upon Mrs. Pillow was not deemed by her satisfactory, and therefore, by mutual agreement she released all interest in the cotton and necessarily in the proceeds of it. No rights of third persons being involved, the parties were as competent to rescind the contract of sale as they were to make it, and the finding of fact is that they did so for what Mrs. Pillow obviously thought a sufficient consideration.\n We are not concerned with whether R. S.  3477 (Comp. St.  6383), prevented the transfer to Hamiter of any rights against the government which Mrs. Pillow may have had. The claimant did not undertake to prove that Hamiter, or any one else, had a valid claim, but that Mrs. Pillow owned the cotton at the time it was seized, and this, we think, he failed to do, and therefore the judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARCUS BROWN HOLDING CO. v.

The tenants are holding over after their lease has expired, which it did on September 30, 1920, claiming the right to do so under Chapters 942 and 947 of the Laws of New York of 1920. The object of the bill is to have these and other connected laws declared unconstitutional. The District Attorney is joined in order to prevent his enforcing by criminal proceedings Chapters 131 and 951 of the acts of the same year, which make it a misdemeanor for the lessor or any agent \n\n[256 U.S. 170, 197]\n\u00a0\n or janitor intentionally to fail to furnish such water, heat, light, elevator, telephone, or other service as may be required by the terms of the lease and necessary to the proper or customary use of the building. The case was heard in the District Court by three judges upon the bill, answer, affidavits and some public documents, all of which may be summed up in a few works. The bill alleges at length the rights given to a lessor by the common law and statutes of New York before the enactment of the statutes relied upon by the tenants, a covenant by the latter to surrender possession at the termination of their lease, and due demand, and claims protection under Article 1, Section 10 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. An affidavit alleges that before the passage of the new statutes another lease of the premises had been made, to go into effect on October 1, 1920. The answer of the tenants relies upon the new statutes and alleges a willingness to pay a reasonable rent and any reasonable increase as the same may be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. It also alleges that they made efforts to obtain another suitable apartment but failed. The District Attorney moved to dismiss the bill. The judged considered the case upon the merits, upheld the laws and ordered the bill to be dismissed.\n By the above mentioned Chapters 942 and 947, a public emergency is declared to exist and it is provided by Chapter 947 that no action 'shall be maintained to recover possession of real property in a city of a population of one million or more or in a city in a county adjoining such city, occupied for dwelling purposes, except an action to recover such possession upon the ground that the person is holding over and is objectionable, ... or an action where the owner of record of the building, being a natural person, seeks in good faith to recover possession of the same or a room or rooms therein for the im mediate- \n\n[256 U.S. 170, 198]\n\u00a0\n and personal occupancy by himself and his family as a dwelling; or an action to recover premises for the purpose of demolishing the same with the intention of constructing a new building. ...' The earlier Chapter 942 is similar with some further details. Both acts are to be in effect only until November 1, 1922. It is unnecessary to state the provisions of Chapter 944 for disputes as to what is a reasonable rent. They are dealt with in the decisions of the Court of Appeals cited below and in Edgar A. Levy Leasing Co., Inc., v. Siegel, 130 N. E. 923, March 8, 1921, by the same Court. In this as in the previous case of Block v. Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 65 L.

In the present case more emphasis is laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract of the lessees to surrender possession and of the new lease which was to have gone into effect upon October 1, last year. But contracts are made subject to this exercise of the power of the State when otherwise justified, as we have held this to be. Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 26 S. Sup.

It is said too that the laws are discriminating, in respect of the cities affected and the character of the buildings, the laws not extending to buildings occupied for business purposes, hotel property or buildings now in course of erection, etc. \n\n[256 U.S. 170, 199]\n\u00a0\n But as the evil to be met was a very pressing want of shelter in certain crowded centers the classification was too obviously justified to need explanation, beyond repeating what was said below as to new buildings, that the unknown cost of completing them and the need to encourage such structures sufficiently explain the last item on the excepted list.\n It is objected finally that Chapter 951, above stated, in so far as it required active services to be rendered to the tenants is void on the rather singular ground that it infringes the Thirteenth Amendment. It is true that the traditions of our law are opposed to compelling a man to perform strictly personal services against his will even when he had contracted to render them. But the services in question although involving some activities are so far from personal that they constitute the universal and necessary incidents of modern apartment houses. They are analogous to the services that in the old law might issue out of or be attached to land. We perceive no additional difficulties in this statute, if applicable as assumed. The whole case was well discussed below and we are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent.\n This case was submitted with Block, etc., v. Hirsh, No. 640, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 65 L. Ed. --.\n Like that case it involves the right of a lessee of property-in this case an apartment in an apartment house in New York City, to retain possession of it under a law of New York after the expiration of the lease. This case is an emphasis of the other, and the argument in that applies to this. It may be more directly applicable \n\n[256 U.S. 170, 200]\n\u00a0\n for in this case the police power of the state is the especial invocation and the court's judgment is a concession to it. And, as we understand, the opinion, in broader and less hesitating declaration of the extent of the potency of that power. 'More emphasis,' it is said, 'is laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract,' than in the Hirsh Case. In measurement of this as a reliance, it is said:\n'But contracts are made subject to this exercise of the power of the State when otherwise justified as we have held this to be.'\n\n The italics are ours and we estimate them by the cases that are cited in their explanation and support. We are not disposed to a review of the cases. We leave them in reference, as the opinion does, with the comment that our deduction from them is not that of the opinion. There is not a line in any of them that declares that the explicit and definite covenants of private individuals engaged in a private and personal matter are subject to impairment by a state law, and we submit, as we argued in the Hirsh Case, that if the state have such power-if its power is superior to article 1,  10, and the Fourteenth Amendment, it is superior to every other limitation upon every power expressed in the Constitution of the United States, commits rights of property to a state's unrestrained conceptions of its interests, and any question of them-remedy against them- is left in such obscurity as to be a denial of both. There is a concession of limitation but no definition of it, and the reasoning of the opinion, as we understand it, and its implications and its incident, establish practically unlimited power.\n We are not disposed to further enlarge upon the case or attempt to reconcile the explicit declaration of the Constitution against the power of the state to impair the obligations of a contract or, under any pretense, to disregard the declaration. It is safer, saner, and more consonant with constitutional pre-eminence and its pur poses \n\n[256 U.S. 170, 201]\n\u00a0\n to regard the declaration of the Constitution as paramount, and not to weaken it by refined dialectics, or bend it to some impulse or emergency 'because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment.'

U S(1921)\nNo. 45\nArgued: October 18, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James R. Caton, of Alexandria, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. H. H. Glassie, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 47, 61]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to recover possession of a strip of land on the Potomac River front of the City of Alexandria. Except an insignificant portion as to which no special defence was made and which it is agreed may be disregarded, this strip lay below low water mark until it was filled in by the United States in 1910-1912 by dredging from the bottom of the river and depositing the material on the other side of a riprap wall built on the river bed. Act of June 25, 1910, c. 382, 36 Stat. 630, 639; Act of February 27, 1911, c. 166, 36 Stat. 933, 937. The United States enclosed the made land by a fence at high water mark, but the defendant, the plaintiff in error, claiming title to the adjoining land inshore, destroyed the fence and took possession, whereupon this \n\n[257 U.S. 47, 62]\n\u00a0\n action was brought. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court alleging that the land was not in the District but was part of Virginia. On this issue the Court found or ruled in favor of the plaintiff and afterwards did the same upon the general issue, a jury having been waived. Judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the defendant took a writ of error to bring the case to this Court.\n A question is raised by the defendant in error as to the jurisdiction of this Court. The language of the Judicial Code (Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231)  250, 36 Stat. 1087, 1159 (Comp St.  1227), is that any final judgment of the Court of Appeals may be reexamined 'First. In cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue.' The words taken literally cover this case, but it is argued that they should be construed as similar words in section 238 (section 1215) concerning the District Courts are construed. In the latter instance, as is well known, they are confined to the jurisdiction of the District Courts as courts of the United States. But the jurisdiction of the District Courts is a limited jurisdiction based upon statutory grounds, and therefore the words of section 238 naturally enough were confined to what always is the first question in a case before them. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on the other hand is a court of general jurisdiction, and whether or not the clause of section 250 was suggested by the earlier one, we see no sufficient justification for denying to it the scope that it must have if it is given its natural sense. The plea to the jurisdiction raises the question clearly, and a certificate would add nothing to what the record shows.\n We are not prepared to say that the judgment before us was not 'otherwise reviewable' on the question of the boundary between the United States and Virginia, so far as the defendant drew in question the construction of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia, section 1, Act June 22, 1874, hereafter discussed. We should hesitate \n\n[257 U.S. 47, 63]\n\u00a0\n to apply the decision in American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia, \n224 U.S. 491\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 553, to such a case.\n The question of the jurisdiction of the trial court and that of the merits very nearly coalesce, as the original title, at least, of Maryland and its jurisdiction were founded upon the same facts, and as the United States succeeded to the rights of Maryland by the grant of the District completed in 1791. That the original title of Maryland extended at least to low water mark on the Virginia side it now is too late to deny, in view of the decisions in Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 45\n, 46 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 268; Id., \n217 \nU.S. 557, 578\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 630; and Morris v. United States, \n174 U.S. 196\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 649. An attempt to throw doubt upon these authorities and upon the effect of the charter of Charles I, June 30, 1632, granting Maryland to Lord Baltimore (ad ulteriorem dicti Fluminis Ripam et eam sequendo, etc., \n217 U.S. 25\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 268), 'to the farther bank of the said [ Potomac] river and following it,' by the charters of James I to Virginia and especially by the terms of a grant from the Governor of Virginia to Howsing in 1669 must fail. The latter grant is subordinate to the former and is not inconsistent with it as the language is 'extending down Potomac River by various courses 3152 po. making a S. Wtly line to a pokecory,' ect. The implication of the words 'by various courses' that the grant follows the line of the stream is not changed by the words 'including several small creeks or inlets.' The land in question is situated upon an indentation, called Battery Cove, but the place is not a creek or inlet. The former decisions of the Court must be followed so far as they go.\n The original state of things was not changed by the grant of Virginia and the regrant by the United States of the part of the District on the Virginia side. They at least did not enlarge the rights of that State. The compact between Virginia and Maryland in 1785 also seems to us to have no bearing upon the case. It says nothing \n\n[257 U.S. 47, 64]\n\u00a0\n about the boundary in terms. Without going into the history of the compact or reciting it, we only need to remark that it was a regulation of commerce, and while with a view to opening up a route to the West it provided in Article 6 that the Potomac should be considered as a common highway for the purposes of navigation and commerce to the citizens of Virginia and Maryland, and in Article 7 gave the citizens of each State full property in the shores of the river adjoining their lands and the privilege of carrying out wharves, etc., with a common right of fishing, it left the question of boundary open to long continued disputes. It may be laid on one side even if it ever was in force in the District of Columbia, which has been denied on the ground that the compact was abrogated so far as it affected this land by the grant of Virginia and was not revived by the grant to the United States. Evans v. United States, 31 App. D. C. 544, 550. See Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12 Pet. 91\n\n\n The question of boundary remaining open was submitted to arbitration which ended in an award accepted by the parties in 1878. But that was an arbitration between the two States and did not purport to affect the boundary of the District. The assent of the United States did not enlarge its scope. Act of March 3, 1879, c. 196, 20 Stat. 481. It is said that as the submission was to an ascertainment of the true boundary line the award must be taken to have determined it, but the question was confined to the boundary between the States as they then were, and whatever may be the force of the argument that the same principle ought to govern here, it was not and could not be adjudicated. Further discussion on this point is not needed. The award fixed low water mark on the Virginia side as the boundary, and is only material if at all as suggesting a claim that the low water line should be drawn from headland to headland and in that \n\n[257 U.S. 47, 65]\n\u00a0\n way include the indentation or cove where the United States has filled. But we know of no reason for construing the charter to Lord Baltimore as so limited or that to Howsing as importing such a rule.\n The only important aspect of the last mentioned suggestion is in connection with a claim of prescriptive right. The land behind the filling of the United States is made land, and the fillings on the Alexandria side go below the original low water mark. In this case, however, there is no attempt to disturb the long maintained possession of such extentions whether originally warranted or not. The only question before us is of the rights of the United States to fill land that hitherto has been under water. The plaintiff in error seeks to exclude it by force of what already has been done and the claims of right that have been made in connection with it. If the taking possession of land under a deed purporting to convey more than the portion actually occupied, no doubt, within reasonable limits, the sovereign power might give to it the effect of adverse possession of the whole, as against other subjects of the same power. Montoya v. Gonzales, \n232 \nU.S. 375, 377\n, 378 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 413. But the effect of filling in upon the edge of a stream as against a different power is another matter. Such acts in themselves import no claim beyond the land thus occupied. Maryland and the United States are not called upon to scrutinize the discourse of those in Virginia even if in statutory form. Except so far as actually occupied the seizin of the land remains in the party that has the title. 'One who enters upon the land of another, though under color of title, gives no notice to that other of any claim, except to the extent of his actual occupancy.' Hunnicutt v. Peyton, \n102 U.S. 333\n, 369. Still more is this true as against independent sovereign rights.\n Finally, on the other hand, the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia, June 22, 1874,  1, describe \n\n[257 U.S. 47, 66]\n\u00a0\n the District as 'including the river Potomac in its course through the District,' which imports an assertion by Congress that the title of the United States embraces the whole river bed; and the jurisdiction of the District over the river seems to have been exercised without dispute. For cases that have reached the reports see Alexandria Canal Railroad & Bridge Co. v. District of Columbia, 1 Mackey, 217, 225, 226; Smoot v. District of Columbia, 23 App. D. C. 266; Evans v. United States, 31 App. D. C. 544.\n It may happen that such filling as is done in this case will interrupt previously existing access to the water front. But that does not affect the right of the United States to possession of the land. What other rights, if any, the plaintiff in error may have does not concern us now.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCLAREN v. FLEISCHER(1921)\nNo. 291\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 477, 478]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controversy arising out of conflicting applications to enter a quarter section of land under the homestead law ( 12 Stat. 392). While the land was public and unappropriated, one Rider made a homestead entry of it, and later it was included, with other lands, in a first-form reclamation withdrawal. \n1\n The withdrawal did not extinguish Rider's entry, but while in force prevented the initiation of other claims. It was largely provisional, and whenver in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior any of the lands were not required for the purpose for which the withdrawal was made they were to be restored to public entry. While the withdrawal \n\n[256 U.S. 477, 479]\n\u00a0\n was in force one Fleischer instituted a contest against Rider's entry, at his own cost collected and presented evidence establishing its invalidity, and procured its cancellation. Rider acquiesced in that decision and is not concerned in the present controversy. Fleischer had no claim to the land prior to the contest, and in instituting and carrying it through acted as a common informer, which was admissible under the public land laws. To encourage the elimination of unlawful entries by such contests Congress had declared in the act of May 14, 1880, c. 89,  2, 21 Stat. 140 ( Comp. St.  4537):\n'In all cases where any person has contested, paid the land office fees, and procured the cancellation of any pre-emption, homestead, or timber culture entry, he shall be notified by the register of the land office of the district in which such land is situated of such cancellation, and shall be allowed thirty days from date of such notice to enter said lands.'\n\n When Rider's entry was canceled the register sent to Fleischer a written notice informing him thereof and stating that he would be allowed 30 days after the tract was restored to public entry within which to enter it in the exercise of his preferred right as a successful contestant. The notice was dated February 11, 1909. Afterwards the Secretary of the Interior issued an order whereby the lands included in the withdrawal were restored to settlement on April 18, 1910, and to public entry on May 18 following. On the earlier date one McLaren made homestead settlement on this tract and on the later date both Fleischer and McLaren applied at the local land office to make homestead entry thereof-Fleischer in the exercise of his preferred right and McLaren in virtue of his settlement. Fleischer's application was allowed and McLaren's rejected, the local officers being of opinion that Fleischer had the prior and better right. McLaren appealed and the action of the local \n\n[256 U.S. 477, 480]\n\u00a0\n officers was sustained by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and by the Secretary of the Interior. In due course Fleischer received a patent for the land and McLaren then brought this suit to have Fleischer declared a trustee for him of the title and to compel a conveyance in execution of the trust. During the pendency of the suit McLaren died and it was revived in the name of his personal representative. Fleischer prevailed in the court of first instance and again in the Supreme Court of the State. 181 Cal. 607, 185 Pac. 967. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n253 U.S. 479\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 482\n\n\n The sole question for decision is whether the officers of the land department erred in matter of law in holding that under the act of May 14, 1880, Fleischer was entitled to 30 days after the land was restored to entry within which to exercise his preferred right of entry. The words of the act are, 'shall be allowed thirty days from the date of such notice to enter said lands.' Generally when an existing entry is canceled the land becomes at once open to entry and the act is easily applied. But where, as here, an existing withdrawal prevents the land from becoming open to entry for more than 30 days after the notice of cancellation issues, the application to be made of the act is not so obvious, and it becomes necessary to inquire what is intended. Does the act mean that the preferred right to enter the land is lost if not exercised within 30 days after the notice issues, even though the land is not open to entry during that period? Or does it mean that the contestant shall have 30 days during which the land is open to entry within which to exercise his preferred right, and therefore that if the land is not open to entry at the date of the notice the time during which that situation continues shall be eliminated in computing the 30-day period? In the practical administration of the act the officers of the land department have adopted and given effect to \n\n[256 U.S. 477, 481]\n\u00a0\n the latter view. They adopted it before the present controversy arose or was thought of, and, except for a departure soon reconsidered and corrected, they have adhered to and followed it ever since. \n2\n Many outstanding titles are based upon it and much can be said in support of it. If not the only reasonable construction of the act, it is at least an admissible one. It therefore comes within the rule that the practical construction given to an act of Congress, fairly susceptible of different constructions, by those charged with the duty of executing it is entitled to great respect and, if acted upon for a number of years will not be disturbed except for cogent reasons. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The case of Edwards v. Bodkin, 249 Fed. 562, 161 C. C. A. 488, and Bodkin v. Edwards, \n\n[256 U.S. 477, 482]\n\u00a0\n 265 Fed. 621, in which there was a decree of affirmance by this court (\n255 U.S. 221\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 268), is cited as upholding a different view of the act. The opinions rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals do indicate that it was disposed to think the words 'thirty days from the date of such notice' should be taken literally and strictly, but a careful reading of the opinions discloses that the decision was not put on that ground. As was rightly said by the Supreme Court of the state in the present case, 'the decision there was not to the effect that the contestant was by mistake of law given the preference right.' Indeed, that case did not call for any expression of opinion on the subject. The plaintiff there was the original homestead entryman and was insisting that his entry had been unlawfully canceled. If that claim was well taken, as was held, the cancellation did not give rise to any preferred right. Besides, the defendant there was not claiming under an entry based on a preferred right, but under entries made after he had relinquished the entry which he claimed was based thereon. Thus the observations of the Circuit Court of Appeals respecting preferred rights were obiter dicta, and, as the decree of affirmance in this court was put on other grounds, those observations are neither authoritative nor persuasive.\n Here it is not questioned that the original or first entry-that of Rider-was lawfully canceled. McLaren recognized that that entry had been lawfully eliminated when he sought to initiate a claim to the land. He should also have recognized that Fleischer, by his contest, had brought about its elimination and was entitled, as a reward, to enter the land at any time within thirty days after it was restored to entry.\n We conclude that the state courts rightly refused to disturb the construction which the officers of the land department had put on the act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The withdrawal was made under the provision embodied in the first six lines of section 3 of the Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388 ( Comp. St.  4702). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The instructions of June 6, 1905, 33 L. D. 607, contained the following:\n'Seventh. When any entry for lands embraced within a withdrawal under the first form is canceled by reason of contest, or for any other reason, such lands become subject immediately to such withdrawal and cannot, thereafter, so long as they remain so withdrawn, be entered or otherwise appropriated, either by a successful contestant or any other person; but any contestant who gains a preferred right to enter any such lands may exercise that right at any time within thirty days from notice that the lands involved have been released from such withdrawal and made subject to entry.'\n\n The regulations of May 18, 1916,  29, 45 L. D. 385, 391, contained the following:\n'Should the land embraced in the contested entry be within a first- form withdrawal at tiem of successful termination of the contest the preferred right may prove futile, for it cannot be exercised as long as the land remains so withdrawn, but should the lands involved be restored to the public domain or a farm-unit plat be approved for the lands and announcement made that water is ready to be delivered, the preference right may be exercised at any time within 30 days from notice of the restoration or the establishment of farm units.'\n\n And see Wells v.

It was made the final judge as to what 'net income' of the estate should be, and its determination in this respect was made binding upon all parties interested therein, 'except that it is my will that stock \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 515]\n\u00a0\n dividends and accretions of selling values shall be considered principal and not income.'\n The widow and four children were living in 1917\n\n\n Among the assets which came to the custody of the trustee were 9,522 shares of the capital stock of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, a corporation. It is averred that the cash value of these shares, on March 1, 1913, was $561, 798, and that they were sold for $1,280,996.64, on February 2, 1917. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated the difference between the value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and the amount for which it was sold on February 2, 1917, as income for the year 1917, and upon that amount assessed the tax which was paid. No question is made as to the amount of the tax if the collection of it was lawful.\n The ground of the protest, and the argument for the plaintiff in error here, is that the sum charged as 'income' represented appreciation in the value of the capital assets of the estate which was not 'income' within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, and therefore could not constitutionally be taxed, without apportionment, as required by section 2, clause 3, and by section 9, clause 4, of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is first argued that the increase in value of the stock could not be lawfully taxed under the act of Congress because it was not income to the widow, for she did not receive it in 1917, and never can receive it, that it was not income in that year to the children for they did not then, and may never, receive it, and that it was not income to the trustee, not only because the will creating the trust required that 'stock dividends and accretions of selling value shall be considered principal and not income,' but also because in the 'common understanding' the term 'income' does not comprehend such a gain or profit as we have here, which it is contended is really an accretion to capital and therefore not constitutionally taxable under Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 509, 516]\n\u00a0\n The provision of the will may be disregarded. It was not within the power of the testator to render the fund nontaxable.\n Assuming for the present that there was constitutional power to tax such a gain or profit as is here involved, are the terms of the statute comprehensive enough to include it?\n Section 2(a) of the act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 757), (40 Stat. 300, 307,  212), applicable to the case, defines the income of 'a taxable person' as including 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in real or personal property ... or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.'\n Plainly the gain we are considering was derived from the sale of personal property, and, very certainly the comprehensive last clause 'gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,' must also include it, if the trustee was a 'taxable person' within the meaning of the act when the assessment was made.\n That the trustee was such a 'taxable person' is clear from section 1204(1)(c) of the act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat. 331), which requires that--\n'Trustees, executors ... and all persons, corporations, or associations, acting in any fiduciary capacity shall make and render a return of the income of the person, trust, or estate for whom or which they act, and be subject to all the provisions of this title which apply to individuals.'\n\n And section 2(b) of the act of September 8, 1916, supra, specifically declares that the--\n'income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement of the estate, ... or any kind of property held in trust, including such income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons, or persons with contingent interests, and income held for \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 517]\n\u00a0\n future distribution under the terms of the will or trust shall be likewise taxed, the tax in each instance, except when the income is returned for the purpose of the tax by the beneficiary, to be assessed to the executor, administrator, or trustee, as the case may be.'\n\n Further, section 2(c) clearly shows that it was the purpose of Congress to tax gains, derived from such a sale as we have here, in the manner in which this fund was assessed, by providing that--\n'For the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, acquired before March 1, 1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of March 1, 1913, shall be the basis for determining the amount of such gain derived.'\n\n Thus, it is the plainly expressed purpose of the act of Congress to treat such a trustee as we have here as a 'taxable person' and for the purposes of the act to deal with the income received for others precisely as if the beneficiaries had received it in person.\n There remains the question, strenuously argued, whether this gain in four years of over $700,000 on an investment of about $500,000 is 'income' within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The question is one of definition, and the answer to it may be found in recent decisions of this Court.\n The Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. 11, 112), was not an income tax law, but a definition of the word 'income' was so necessary in its administration that in an early case it was formulated as 'A gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined.' Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 415\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 136, 140 (58 L. Ed. 285).\n This definition, frequently approved by this court, received an addition, in its latest income tax decision, which \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 518]\n\u00a0\n is especially significant in its application to such a case as we have here, so that it now reads:\n'Income may be defined as a gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, provided it be understood to include profit gained through sale or conversion of capital assets.' Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 193 (64 L. Ed. 521), 9 A. L. R. 1570.\n\n The use made of this definition of 'incone' in the decision of cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909, and under the Income Tax Acts, is, we think, decisive of the case before us. Thus, in two cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act:\n In Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 U.S. 189\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 470, a coal company, without corporate authority to trade in stocks, purchased shares in another coal mining company in 1902, which it sold in 1911, realizing a profit of $210,000. Over the same objection made in this case, that the fund was merely converted capital, this court held that so much of the profit upon the sale of the stock as accrued subsequent to the effective date of the act was properly treated as income received during 1911, in assessing the tax for that year.\n In United States v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Co., \n247 U.S. 195\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 472, a railroad company purchased shares of stock in another railroad company in 1900, which it sold in 1909, realizing a profit of $814,000. Here, again, over the same objection, this court held that the part of the profit which accrued subsequent to the effective date of the act was properly treated as income received during the year 1909 for the purposes of the act.\n Thus, from the price realized from the sale of stock by two investors, as distinguished from dealers, and from a single transaction as distinguished from a course of business, the value of the stock on the effective date of the tax act was deducted, and the resulting gain was treated by this court as 'income' by which the tax was measured.\n It is obvious that these decisions in principle rule the \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 519]\n\u00a0\n case at bar if the word 'income' has the same meaning in the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of meaning was in effect decided in Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 540, where it was assumed for the purposes of decision that there was no difference in its meaning as used in the act of 1909 and in the Income Tax Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114). There can be no doubt that the word must be given the same meaning and content in the Income Tax Acts of 1916 and 1917 that it had in the act of 1913. When to this we add that in Eisner v. Macomber, supra, a case arising under the same Income Tax Act of 1916 which is here involved, the definition of 'income' which was applied was adopted from Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, supra, arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, with the addition that it should include 'profit gained through sale or conversion of capital assets,' there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation Excise Tax Act, and that what that meaning is has now become definitely settled by decisions of this Court.\n In determining the definition of the word 'income' thus arrived at, this Court has consistently refused to enter into the refinements of lexicographers or economists, and has approved, in the definitions quoted, what it believed to be the commonly understood meaning of the term which must have been in the minds of the people when they adopted the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 467; Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 207 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. Notwithstanding the full argument heard in this case and in the series of cases now under consideration, we continue entirely satisfied with that definition, and, since the fund here taxed was the amount realized from the sale of the stock in 1917, less the capital investment \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 520]\n\u00a0\n as determined by the trustee as of March 1, 1913, it is palpable that it was a 'gain or profit' 'produced by' or 'derived from' that investment, and that it 'proceeded' and was 'severed' or rendered severable from it by the sale for cash, and thereby became that 'realized gain' which has been repeatedly declared to be taxable income within the meaning of the constitutional amendment and the acts of Congress. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co. and Eisner v. Macomber, supra.\n It is elaborately argued in this case, in No. 609, Eldorado Coal & Mining Co. v. Harry W. Mager, Collector, etc., submitted with it, and in other cases since argued, that the word 'income' as used in the Sixteenth Amendment and in the Income Tax Act we are considering does not include the gain from capital realized by a single isolated sale of property, but that only the profits realized from sales by one engaged in buying and selling as a business-a merchant, a real estate agent, or broker- constitute income which may be taxed.\n It is sufficient to say of this contention that no such distinction was recognized in the Civil War Income Tax Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 471, 478), or in the act of 1894 (28 Stat. 509, 553), declared unconstitutional on an unrelated ground; that it was not recognized in determining income under the Excise Tax Act of 1909, as the cases cited, supra, show; that it is not to be found, in terms, in any of the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917, or 1919 (40 Stat. 1057); that the definition of the word 'income' as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, which has been developed by this Court, does not recognize any such distinction; that in departmental practice, for now seven years, such a rule has not been applied; and that there is no essential difference in the nature of the transaction or in the relation of the profit to the capital involved, whether the sale or conversion be a single, isolated transaction or one of many. \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 521]\n\u00a0\n The interesting and ingenious argument, which is earnestly pressed upon us, that this distinction is so fundamental and obvious that it must be assumed to be a part of the 'general understanding' of the meaning of the word 'income,' fails to convince us that a construction should be adopted which would, in a large measure, defeat the purpose of the amendment.\n The opinions of the courts in dealing with the rights of life tenants and remaindermen in gains derived from invested capital, especially in dividends paid by corporations, are of little value in determining such a question as we have here, influenced as such decisions are by the terms of the instruments creating the trusts involved and by the various rules adopted in the various jurisdictions for attaining results thought to be equitable. Here the trustee, acting within its powers, sold the stock, as it might have sold a building, and realized a profit of $700,000, which at once became assets in its possession free for any disposition within the scope of the trust, but for the purposes of taxation to be treated as if the trustee were the sole owner.\n Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, much relied upon in argument, was sufficiently distinguished from cases such as we have here in Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 \nU.S. 189, 191\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 470. The differences in the statutes involved render inapplicable the expressions in the opinion in that case (not necessary to the decision of it) as to distinctions between income and increase of capital.\n In Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 U.S. 221\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 537, also much relied upon, it is expressly stated that--\n'According to the fact admitted, there was no increase after that date [March 1, 1913], and therefore no increase subject to the law.'\n\n For this reason the questions here discussed and decided were not there presented.\n The British income tax decisions are interpretations of statutes so wholly different in their wording from the \n\n[255 U.S. 509, 522]\n\u00a0\n acts of Congress which we are considering that they are quite without value in arriving at the construction of the laws here involved.\n Another assessment on a small gain realized upon a purchase, made in 1914, of bonds which were duly called for redemption and paid in 1917, does not present any questions other than those which we have discussed, and therefore it does not call for separate consideration.\n The judgment of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, because of prior decisions of the Court, concur in the judgment. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCHANTS' NAT BANK OF RICHMOND, VA, v. CITY OF RICHMOND(1921)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: June 6, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 635, 636]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Legh R. Page and E. Warren Wall, both of Richmond, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Henry R. Pollard and George Wayne Anderson, both of Richmond, Va., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court of last resort of Virginia sustained a tax assessed by the city of Richmond in the year 1915, in form against plaintiff in error, a national banking association, in substance and effect against its shareholders, overruling a contention based upon the Constitution and laws of the United States. To review its judgment a writ of error has been sued out and allowed, and application has been made also for the allowance of a writ of certiorari. The proceeding originated in the hustings court of the city of Richmond with a petition filed by the bank against the city to correct the assessment as erroneous. The first hearing resulted in an order granting the relief prayed for, upon grounds not now material; but, upon review by the Supreme Court of Appeals, this was reversed (124 Va. 522, 98 S. E. 643), and the case remanded \n\n[256 U.S. 635, 637]\n\u00a0\n for further proceedings in conformity with the views of that court; in consequence of which, correction of the alleged erroneous assessment was refused by the trial court, and the proceeding dismissed. An application for a writ of error to review this judgment was denied by the Supreme Court of Appeals, with the effect of affirming the judgment of the hustings court.\n The tax was imposed pursuant to an ordinance approved April 9, 1915, passed under the powers conferred upon the city by its charter and an act of the General Assembly approved March 15, 1915 (Acts Va. 1915, c. 85, p. 119). The opinion of the court of last resort shows that plaintiff in error drew in question the validity of the ordinance and statute, as construed and applied, upon the ground of their alleged repugnance to section 5219, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St.  9784), and that the court sustained their validity notwithstanding. Under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by Act of Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214 ), a writ of error is the appropriate process for reviewing the final judgment in this court, and the petition for allowance of a writ of certiorari will be denied.\n It will not be necessary to recite the provisions of the statute and ordinance, beyond saying that, taken in connection with another act of the General Assembly, approved March 17, 1915 (Acts Va. 1915, c. 117, p. 160), they authorized the imposition for the year 1915 upon bank stocks, state and national, of a tax for state purposes at the rate of 35 cents and a tax for city purposes at the rate of $1.40-a total of $1.75-upon the $100 of valuation, while upon intangible personal property in general, including bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness, the state rate was 65 cents and the city rate 30 cents, an aggregate of 95 cents, upon each $100 of valuation.\n The bank's petition alleged, and the evidence showed without dispute, that in the city of Richmond, in 1915, \n\n[256 U.S. 635, 638]\n\u00a0\n city and state taxes at the rates first mentioned were imposed upon national bank stocks (including that of plaintiff in error) to the aggregate value of more than $8,000,000, and stocks of state banks and trust companies to the value of $6,000,000 and upwards, while taxes at the lower aggregate rate of 95 cents per $100-city tax, 30 cents; state tax, 65 cents-were imposed for the same year upon bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness aggregating $6,250,000. It is to be inferred that a substantial part of this aggregate was in the hands of individual taxpayers; the precise amount does not appear. It also was shown by evidence without dispute that moneyed capital in the hands of individuals invested in bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness comes into competition with the national banks in the loan market.\n Neither of the state courts passed upon this evidence or made findings of fact thereon, doubtless because, under their respective views of the applicable law, the facts referred to were immaterial. But this omission does not relieve us of the duty of examining the evidence for the purpose of determining what facts reasonably might be, and presumably would be, found therefrom by the state court, if plaintiff in error's contention upon the question of federal law should be sustained, and the facts thereby shown to be material. Carlson v. Curtiss, \n234 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 717\n\n\n The Supreme Court of Appeals entertained the view that the purpose of section 5219, Rev. Stat., was confined to the prevention of discrimination by the states in favor of state banking associations as against national banking associations, and that since none such is shown here there was no repugnance to the federal statute. This, however, is too narrow a view of section 5219. It traces its origin to section 41 of the Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 111, 112, in which, besides the restriction that state taxation of the shares of national banking associations should not be at a \n\n[256 U.S. 635, 639]\n\u00a0\n greater rate than that assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state, there was an express proviso that the tax should not exceed the rate imposed upon the shares of state banks. But this was modified by Act of February 10, 1868, c. 7, 15 Stat. 34 (Comp. St .  9784), in a manner which, as was pointed out in Boyer v. Boyer, \n113 \nU.S. 689, 691\n, 692 S., 5 Sup. Ct. 706, precluded the possibility of an interpretation permitting the states, while imposing the same taxation upon national bank shares as upon shares in state banks, to discriminate against national bank shares in favor of moneyed capital not invested in state bank stock. 'At any rate,' said the court, 'the Acts of Congress do not now permit any such discrimination.' In the amended form the provision was carried into the Revised Statutes as section 5219, which prescribes that state taxation of shares in the national banks 'shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state.'\n By repeated decisions of this court, dealing with the restriction here imposed, it has become established that while the words 'moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens' do not include shares of stock in corporations that do not enter into competition with the national banks, they do include something besides shares in banking corporations and others that enter into direct competition with those banks. They include not only moneys invested in private banking, properly so called, but investments of individuals in securities that represent money at interest and other evidences of indebtedness such as normally enter into the business of banking. In Evansville Bank v. Britton, \n105 U.S. 322\n, 324, the court said:\n'The act of Congress does not make the tax on personal property the measure of the tax on bank shares in the state, but the tax on moneyed capital in the hands of the individual citizens. Credits, money loaned at interest, and demands against persons or corporations \n\n[256 U.S. 635, 640]\n\u00a0\n are more purely representative of moneyed capital than personal property, so far as they can be said to differ. Undoubtedly there may be much personal property exempt from taxation without giving bank shares a right to similar exemption, because personal property is not necessarily moneyed capital. But the rights, credits, demands, and money at interest mentioned in the Indiana statute, from which bona fide debts may be deducted, all mean moneyed capital invested in that way. ... We are of opinion that the taxation of bank shares by the Indiana statute, without permitting the shareholder to deduct from their assessed value the amount of his bona fide indebtedness, as in the case of other investments of moneyed capital, is a discrimination forbidden by the act of Congress.'\n\n And in Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 U.S. 138\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 826, the court speaking by Mr. Justice Matthews, after reviewing previous decisions and pointing out (\n121 U.S. 154\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 826) the policy and purpose of the act as the key to its proper interpretation, proceeded to declare (\n121 U.S. 157\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 836):\n'The terms of the act of Congress, therefore, include shares of stock or other interests owned by individuals in all enterprises in which the capital employed in carrying on its business is money, where the object of the business is the making of profit by its use as money. The moneyed capital thus employed is invested for that purpose in securities by way of loan, discount, or otherwise, which are from time to time, according to the rules of the business, reduced again to money and reinvested. It includes money in the hands of individuals employed in a similar way, invested in loans, or in securities for the payment of money, either as an investment of a permanent character, or temporarily with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment. In this way the moneyed capital in the hands of individuals is distinguished from what is known generally as personal property.'\n\n Proceeding then to quote the passage we have cited from Evansville Bank v. Britton, supra. \n\n[256 U.S. 635, 641]\n\u00a0\n In Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 390\n, 391 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 114, the above-mentioned declaration of the court in Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 157\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 826, including the citation from Evansville Bank v. Britton, was repeated, and it was pointed out that the rule of construction thus laid down had since been consistently adhered to. No decision of this court to which our attention is called has qualified that rule, or construed section 5219 as leaving out of consideration the rate of state taxation imposed upon moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens invested in loans or securities for the payment of money, either for permanent or temporary purposes, where such moneyed capital comes into competition with that of the national banks. Thus, in Bank of Commerce v. Seattle, \n166 \nU.S. 463, 464\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 996, the precise ground of decision was the want of a showing that 'the moneyed capital left unassessed was, as to any material portion thereof, moneyed capital coming into competition with that of national banks.' To the same effect First National Bank of Wellington v. Chapman, \n173 \nU.S. 205, 219\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 407. In the present case, there is a clear showing of such competition, relatively material in amount, and it follows that, upon the undisputed facts, the ordinance and statute under which the stock of plaintiff in error was assessed, as construed and applied, exceeded the limitation prescribed by section 5219, Rev. Stat., and hence that the tax is invalid.\n Application for writ of certiorari denied.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMICHIGAN CENT R. CO. v. MARK OWEN & CO(1921)\nNo. 299\nArgued: April 28, 1921Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ralph M. Shaw and Frank H. Towner, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner,\n Messrs. William B. Moulton and Joseph A. Bates, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action in the municipal court of Chicago for damages for loss on several shipments of grapes, four car lots, shipped in sound and merchantable condition.\n On receipt of the shipments bills of lading were issued. The total loss is alleged to have been 126 baskets of grapes of the value of $23.30. The municipal court found against plaintiff (respondent here, and it will be so referred to). The judgment was reversed by the Appellate Court, First District, of the state, and judgment awarded respondent which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n the state, to which an appeal was granted because the court of appeals considered that the case involved questions of importance 'on account of principal and collateral interests' which should be passed upon by the Supreme Court.\n Our review is concerned with questions of law; the facts are undisputed. It is stipulated that the cars were transported by the railroad company from their respective points of origin to Chicago, arriving there at different days and times of the days. Upon the arrival of each car it was placed on a public delivery track of the railroad company and notice thereof given. Respondent accepted each car, breaking the seals thereof; and it is stipulated that at the time respondent started to unload, each of the cars contained the number of baskets and pounds of grapes received for transportation. The loss, whatever there was, occurred after the acceptance of the cars and their unloading had commenced, and whether the railroad company is liable therefor, and in what capacity liable-whether as carrier, or warehouseman, or at all-is the question in the case.\n The answer depends upon the construction to be given to the first paragraph of section 5 of the bill of lading. It is as follows:\n'Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it, within 48 hours exclusive of legal holidays, after notice of its arrival has been duly sent or given, may be kept in car, depot, or place of delivery of the carrier subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only, or may be, at the option of the carrier, removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the cost of the owner, and there held at owner's risk and without liability on the part of the carrier and subject to a lien for all freight and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the charge for storage.' \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n Regarding the words of the section merely, carrier and subject to a lien for all freight and sense.' But controversies have arisen and judicial judgments have divided upon them. The point of the controversies has been, and is, as to the relation of the carrier to a shipment within 48 hours after notice of its arrival has been duly sent or given, and the contentions upon the point are in sharp antagonism. That of respondent is that the railroad company during the 48 hours is responsible as a carrier, this relation not terminating until the expiration of that time. The contention of the railroad company is contra, and that it, the company, is neither liable as a carrier or warehouseman. Not as carrier because the shipment had been delivered and accepted-not as warehouseman because no negligence has been proved against it. The Supreme Court decided against the contentions of the railroad company and held it liable for loss on all of the shipments. As to three of them we may say immediately, in disposition of them, respondent withdraws any claim on account of them, and confines the issue to one car which was undoubtedly unloaded within 48 hours of the notice of its arrival. There is question of the other cars.\n\n The importance of the issue, however, still remains, although it is concerned with only 31 baskets of grapes, of the value of $8.68, and the difficulty of its determination is indicated by the fact of the diversity of judicial reasoning upon a like issue in other cases. And counsel have been at pains to set the cases in opposition with approving or disapproving comment of their own.\n The differences of the cases cannot be reconciled and a review of them for the purpose of selection would manifestly extend this opinion to a great length. Their outside principle is simple enough; the bill of lading is a contract between the transportation company and him who is interested in the shipment, and legal when \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n within the policy and edicts of the law regulating that relation. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n By recurring to section 5 of the bill of lading, it will be seen that it supposes a contingency and provides for its occurrence. it supposes that property may not be removed when it has reached destination, and is available for delivery, and two periods of time are provided for. One of 48 hours after notice of the arrival of the property has been sent or given. During this time there is no declaration of the relation of the railroad company to the property. The other period commences at the expiration of the first or 48-hour period, during which the provision is that the property is subject 'to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only.' The comparison has its significance and must be accounted for. Realizing this, the railroad company makes a distinction. Its contention is that where delivery has been made of the property as, it insists was true, in the case at bar, the responsibility of the railroad company as carrier immediately ceases. If, however, it is neither delivered nor removed within 48 hours after notice of its arrival, the responsibility of the railroad company thereafter is that of 'warehouseman only.'\n To the distinction and the contention based upon it, the Supreme Court of the state answered that the bill of lading provides for property 'not removed'-not to property 'delivered' or 'not delivered,' and it must be taken at its word.\n The answer puts too much emphasis upon the distinction between property removed and property delivered. \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n The property here was not delivered; access was only given to it that it might be removed, and 48 hours were given for the purpose. Pending that time it was within the custody of the railroad company, the company having the same relation to it that the company acquired by its receipt and had during its transportation.\n The bill of lading is definite, as we have pointed out, in its provisions and of the time at which responsibility of the company shall be that of warehouseman, and by necessary implication, therefore, until that responsibility attaches, that of carrier exists.\n All the elements of the case considered and assigned their persuasive force, we think the judgment of the Supreme Court should be and it is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice MCREYNOLDS dissenting.\n This cause is important because of what had been said concerning section 5 of the uniform bill of lading approved and recommended by the Interstate Commerce Commission after much consideration and repeated conferences between carriers and shippers, extending through four years.\n In their report, 14 Interest. Com. Com'n R. (1908) 346, 348, 349, 350, the Commission said:\n'This proposed bill of lading-for the two forms may be considered as one in what we have further to say-is submitted for adoption by the carriers and use by the shipping public with considerable confidence. It is not claimed to be perfect, and experience may develop the need of further modifications, but it represents the most intelligent and exhaustive efforts of those who undertook its preparation to agree upon a bill of lading which should be reasonably satisfactory to the railroads and the public. It is, of course, more or less a compromise between opposing \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n interests, because on the one hand it imposes obligations of an important character which carriers have not heretofore assumed, and on the other retains exemptions to which some shippers may object, and perhaps not without substantial reason. As we are advised, it is in some respects less favorable to the shipper than the local laws or regulations of one or more states, but is more favorable to the shipper than the local laws or regulations of most of the states. On the whole, it is believed to be the best adjustment which is now practicable of a controversy of long standing which affects the business interests of the entire country. ... The circumstances under which the work of the joint committee has been conducted and the substantial agreement on most points by the different interests concerned, to say nothing of direct assurances from representatives of the carriers, warrant us in expecting that the assenting roads will adopt the bill upon our recommendation. We therefore assume that the railroads in Official Classification territory, whose proposed action was the subject of the original investigation, will adopt and use this bill, to the extent above indicated, from and after the date named for that purpose. We shall also expect that railroad carriers subject to the act outside of Official Classification territory will adopt and use this bill of lading to the same extent and from and after the same date. There may be peculiar conditions in Western and Southern territory which require some modifications of or additions to this standard bill, but the desirability of uniform usage is so great and the reasons for it so obvious as to justify the expectation that carriers in Western and Southern territory will adopt the bill in question to the fullest extent practicable without abridging any just privileges which their shippers now enjoy.'\n\n The language in controversy was not selected by the carriers alone; they reluctantly accepted the whole instrument \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n rather than dictated it to others. Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Reiss, \n183 U.S. 621\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 253, holding that doubtful provisions should be resolved in the shipper's favor, is not applicable. The agreement ought to be construed and applied as one arrived at through deliberate negotiation by intelligent parties seeking to make some definite statement or modification of common law rules concerning their rights and liabilities.\n The carrier acknowledges receipt of--\n'The property described ... marked, consigned and destined as indicated below, which said carrier (which word is to be understood throughout this bill of lading as meaning any person or corporation in possession of the property under the bill of lading) agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.'\n\n Among other things, section 1 provides:\n'The carrier or party in possession of any of the property herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided. ... When in accordance with general custom, on account of the nature of the property, or when at the request of the shipper the property is transported in open cars, the carrier or party in possession (except in case of loss or damage by fire, in which case the liability shall be the same as though the property had been carried in closed cars) shall be liable only for negligence, and the burden to prove freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier or party in possession.'\n\n Section 5 follows:\n'Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it within forty-eight hours (exclusive of legal holidays) after notice of its arrival has been duly sent or given may be kept in car, depot, or place of delivery of the carrier, or warehouse, subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only, or \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n may be, at the option of the carrier, removed to and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the cost of the owner and there held at the owner's risk and without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.'\n\n The uniform bill does not purport to specify all rights and obligations of the parties as between themselves, but leaves these as established by law, except when and as otherwise provided. Particularly, it does not undertake to define what shall constitute delivery to the consignee.\n'In order to simplify the issues the respondent' confines its claim here to losses from car No. 22049-$8.68. The parties stipulated that this car--\n\n'arrived in Chicago on October 8, 1914, was placed on a public delivery team track on October 9, 1914, at 8 a. m. o'clock; that notice of arrival and placement of said car was given to the plaintiff herein on October 9, 1914, at 9 a. m. o'clock; that plaintiff accepted said car, broke the seals thereon, and started to unload it on October 9, 1914, at 9:30 a. m. o'clock; and that the unloading of said car was completed by the plaintiff on October 9, 1914, at 6 p. m. o'clock. ... That at the time the plaintiff accepted and started to unload each of said cars, every car contained the same number of baskets and pounds of grapes as were received by the defendant in said car for transportation at the point of origin thereof, named herein, and that at said time the doors of each of said cars were sealed with the same seals intact as were placed on them by the defendant when it received said grapes for transportation.'\n\n The circumstances accompanying acceptance and unloading are not revealed except as above stated. Whether these suffice clearly to establish final and complete delivery of possession of the freight to the consignee may be questioned, but mere consideration of the bill cannot \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n solve the difficulty. If, as matter of fact, the consignee was put into actual possession of the property within 48 hours, it must be clear that the carrier's liability as insurer ceased when he accepted control.\n What constitutes delivery by a railroad carrier sufficient to change its responsibility from insurer to warehouseman has given occasion for much difference of opinion.\n The so-called New York rule, the strictest against the carrier,\n'is stated to be that if the consignee is present, upon the arrival of the goods, he must take them without unreasonable delay; if he is not present, but lives at or in the immediate vicinity of the place of delivery, the carrier must notify him of the arrival of the goods, and then he must have a reasonable time to remove them; if he is absent, unknown or cannot be found, the carrier may store them; and if, after notice of the arrival of the goods, the consignee has had a reasonable opportunity to remove them, and does not, he cannot hold the carrier longer as an insurer.' Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.)  708.\n\n The Massachusetts rule has been thus stated:\n'All that could be required of railways was a safe deposit of the goods upon the platform or in the warehouse of the road at the end of the transit, to await delivery to the consignee, when he should call for them, and that from the time of such deposit, even without notice by the carrier to the consignee, the liability of the former was changed from that of common carrier to warehouseman.' Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.)  702.\n\n The New Hampshire rule continues the carrier's liability as insurer until the consignee has had a reasonable time to receive the goods after their arrival at destination. During that period--\n'the servants of the carrier still continue in charge of them. They are equally shut off from observation and the oversight of others as when in transit; and if they are lost, damaged, or purloined, he \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n has no greater opportunity of ascertaining or proving by whose fault or negligence it was done, than if such loss had occurred during the transportation. Consequently, the same reasons for holding the carrier to extraordinary responsibility during the transportation of the goods exist after their arrival, at least, until the owner or consignee shall have had an opportunity to take them in charge.' Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.)  704.\n\n Undoubtedly, the uniform bill was prepared with the above rules in mind. It did not adopt any of them, but left the matter to which they relate for determination by the courts.\n It should be noted that the bill acknowledged receipt of property 'which said carrier ... agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination,' and further, that 'the carrier or party in possession of any of the property herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.'\n The special purpose of section 5 was to protect the carrier by placing an extreme limit upon the time during which freight might remain with it without charge for storage; and also to define the carrier's right and obligation thereafter. The unnecessary delay incident to unloading and the undue utilization of railroad cars and warehouses by consignees for storage purposes had seriously hindered prompt movement of freight, and proper employment of equipment. This section does not purport to establish any rule of liability during the 48 hours, but leaves that to be determined by application of the common law to the circumstances. To say that a carrier insures for 48 hours although the consignee has taken actual custody of the goods would seem an absurd conclusion. And the practical impossibility of stationing an agent at every car within \n\n[256 U.S. 427, 438]\n\u00a0\n a great terminal while freight is being removed by thousands of consignees and their agents-a necessary precaution of thefts or mistakes by any one of them must be prevented-makes it manifest that the Interstate Commerce Commission would not have sanctioned the responsibility now claimed and that the carriers would not have acquiesced. I cannot think there was purpose to burden carriers beyond the most stringent of the rules above referred to.\n The fair inference from the facts stipulated is that the consignee received possession and control of his goods before the loss occurred. A carrier's responsibility as insurer depends upon exclusive possession and control and must cease when these end. The modified one prescribed by the uniform bill for goods shipped in open cars where such possession and control is difficult or impossible to maintain gives practical recognition to the real basis upon which liability rests. Here the car was opened, examined, accepted and apparently thereafter remained in charge of the consignee. Yet, it is said the delivery was not sufficient to terminate liability as insurer but that this continued because of section 5, which in plain terms refers only to removal. It must not be forgotten that we are not dealing here with a question of due care but with the absolute liability of an insurer.\n It is not good reasoning to conclude that because an extreme limit is placed upon the time during which freight may remain in a car without charge, therefore the carrier's liability as an insurer continues during such time.\n The uniform bill is in common use and the opinion of the court will be far-reaching. The subject therefore seems sufficiently important to demand an indication of the reasons which lead me to dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v.

SACRAMENTO & SAN JOAQUIN DRAINAGE DIST(1921)\nNo. 347\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward F. Treadwell, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles S. Peery, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendant in error. \n\n[256 U.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause is here upon writ of error to the Supreme Court of the state of California, 187 Pac. 1041. There is also an application for certiorari, but under the settled practice no adequate grounds therefor are shown.\n By the Act of August 10, 1913 (Stats, 1913, p. 252), the Legislature of California undertook to create the Sacramento & San Joaquin drainage district, including 1,725,553 acres along the general course of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and particularly an extensive area south of Stockton. The Reclamation Board, appointed as directed by the statute, levied a tax of $250,000 for general preliminary expenses incidental to the project and appointed assessors to apportion the same. Certain of plaintiff in error's lands lying south of Stockton were assessed at five cents per acre, and to annul this assessment it began the present proceeding. In support of the writ of error reliance is placed upon the contention that, as construed by the state courts, the act of 1913 denies plaintiff in error opportunity to show that its lands will receive no special or direct benefits from the proposed works, and therefore conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment. But we think that when the writ was sued out (May, 1920) this claim had already become too unsubstantial to support our jurisdiction as defined by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stats. 726. Since Houck v. Little River Drainage District (1915) \n239 U.S. 254\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 58, the doctrine has been definitely settled that in the absence of flagrant abuse or purely arbitrary action a state may establish drainage districts and tax lands therein for local improvements, and that none of such lands may escape liability solely because they will not receive direct benefits. The allegations of the original \n\n[256 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n complaint are wholly insufficient to raise the issue in respect of arbitrary legislative action presented by Myles Salt Co. v. Board of Commissioners, \n239 U.S. 478\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 204, L. R. A. 1918E, 190.\n The petition for certiorari is denied and the writ of error is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILLER v. AMERICAN BONDING CO(1921)\nNo. 59\nArgued: November 8, 1921Decided: December 12, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. James G. Glessner, of York, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Francis B. Bracken, of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Bonding Company was the surety in a bond given to the United States to secure the performance of a contract to construct a public building, at York, Pa., and the prompt payment of claims for labor and material supplied to the contractor in the prosecution of the work. The building was completed and a final settlement as between the contractor and the United States was had. No action on the bond was begun by the United States in its own behalf; but an action thereon in the name of the United States was seasonably brought by \n\n[257 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Caesar Francini for his use and benefit. He claimed that he had supplied some of the labor and material and had not been paid. In due time others making similar claims intervened in the action for the purpose of presenting their claims, having them adjudicated and realizing on the bond. C. E. Miller was one of the claimants who intervened.\n The bonding company interposed affidavits of defense to all the claims, and after issue was thus joined the action was set for trial at a stated session of the court, and all the parties were notified. At the appointed session a trial was had, before the court and a jury, in which all the claimants other than Miller participated. Although represented by counsel who was present when the trial was begun, Miller neither asked a continuance nor requested a separate trial, and yet 'without apparent reason or excuse' he refused and neglected to submit his claim for adjudication at that time. The jury returned a verdict for each of the other claimants, and a judgment giving effect to the verdict was entered, the aggregate of the claims included in the judgment being less than the amount of the bond. The surety sought a review in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court affirmed the judgment as to all the claims, but one, and as to it reversed the judgment, with a direction for a new trial. American Bonding Co. v. U. S., 233 Fed. 364, 147 C. C. A. 300. That claim was then compromised and settled, so the new trial was not had.\n Shortly after the trial and verdict Miller caused the case to be put on the trial list for a separate trial of his claim. The bonding company promptly challenged his right to do this, but consented that, if a new trial of the other claims should be ordered and had, his claim might be submitted with the others on the retrial. The court then directed that the case be left off the trial list pending the review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. That review, as we have seen, did not result in a new trial of the \n\n[257 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n other claims, or any of them. More than two years after the review Miller again caused the case to be put on the trial list, and the court, on the bonding company's motion, struck it from the list. The court did this on the ground that the case had been theretofore set for trial and tried, that on that trial Miller had been afforded and had rejected an opportunity to establish his claim, and that he was not entitled to another opportunity to establish it. U. S. v. Welles (D. C.) 256 Fed. 545. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, Miller v. American Bonding Co., 262 Fed. 103, and Miller sued out the present writ of error.\n Whether the court erred in denying Miller another opportunity to establish his claim, and thereby in effect dismissing it, is the question for decision. He particularly insists that he was entitled as of right to a separate trial, and was not required to participate with other claimants in a common trial.\n The bond was given, and the action was brought, under the act of August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended by Act February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811 (Comp. St.  6923). That act contemplates and provides for two kinds of action on such a bond-one brought by the United States in its own behalf; the other brought in its name for the use and benefit of a claimant who supplies the contractor with labor or material for which the contractor fails to pay. Where the United States sues in its own behalf, any one having a claim for labor or material used in the work is accorded a 'right to intervene and be made a party' and to have his claim 'adjudicated in such action and judgment rendered thereon,' subject to a priority which is accorded to the claim of the United States; and if the recovery on the bond be not sufficient to pay all the claims, the judgment must direct the payment of the full amount due the United States and the distribution 'pro rata among said interveners' of the remainder of the recovery. Only when the United States does not sue \n\n[257 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n within six months 'from the completion and final settlement of the contract' may an action in its name be brought by a private claimant for his use and benefit. Where such a claimant sues, 'only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made a party thereto'; and if the recovery on the bond be not sufficient 'to pay the amounts found due to all of said creditors, judgment shall be given to each creditor pro rata of the amount of the recovery.' In any suit notice is to be given informing all creditors of 'their right to intervene.'\n This summary of the act suffices to show that all claims under the bond are to be presented, adjudicated, and enforced in a single action in which every claimant may intervene and be heard as a party to it. Of course the purpose in this is to avoid the expense, confusion, and delay incident to a multiplicity of actions, to enable each claimant to be heard, not only in support of his own claim, but also in opposition to the claims of others in so far their allowance may tend to prevent the full payment of his claim, and generally to conserve the common security for the benefit of all who are netitled to share in it.\n The right of action given to those who have claims against the contractor is a creature of the act, and the mode of enforcement there prescribed cannot be disregarded. Texas Cement Co. v. McCord, \n233 \nU.S. 157, 162\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 550; United States v. Congress Construction Co., \n222 U.S. 199\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 44. We have held that the enforcement is to be in a proceeding at law, and not in equity. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, \n240 U.S. 214\n, 223. 36 Sup. Ct. 321. The provision that there shall be but one action, which shall be open to all claimants, and the provision dealing with the judgment to be entered, show that the action is to proceed as a single case. There is nothing in the act indicative of a purpose to accord to each claimant a separate trial as of right; and to do so would make the provision for a single \n\n[257 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n action of little avail. In actions at law the general practice is to try all the issues in a case at one time; and it is only in exceptional instances where there are special and persuasive reasons for departing from this practice that distinct causes of action asserted in the same case may be made the subjects of separate trials. Whether this reasonably may be done in any particular instance rests largely in the court's discretion. See Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon, \n188 \nU.S. 208, 210\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 294.\n We conclude that Miller was not entitled as of right to a separate trial, and that on this record it cannot be said that the court erred in refusing him a second opportunity to establish his claim, and in effect dismissing it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC R. CO. v. AULT(1921)\nNo. 252\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 554, 555]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert E. Wiley, of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Frank Pace, of Little Rock, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Arkansas provides that whenever a railroad company, or a receiver operating a railroad, shall discharge an employee, with or without cause, it shall pay him his full wages within seven days thereafter and that if payment is not duly made 'then as a penalty for such nonpayment the wages of such servant or employee shall continue from the date of the discharge or refusal to further employ, at the same rate until paid.' Kirby's Digest,  6649, as amended by Act of 1905, No. 210. Proceeding under this statute, in August, 1918, Ault brought suit before a justice of the peace against the \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 556]\n\u00a0\n Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, alleging that he had been employed by the company at the rate of $2.50 per day, that he had been discharged on July 29, 1918, and that $50 was then due him as wages but had not been paid. He recovered judgment by default. The company appealed to the Circuit Court and there moved, in January, 1919, to substitute as defendant the Director General of Railroads. This substitution the court refused to make; but it joined the Director General as defendant and entered judgment agaisnt both him and the company upon a verdict that Ault recover the sum of $50 as debt and $390 as penalty. That judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 140 Ark. 572, 216 S. W. 3.\n The President had taken possession and control of the Missouri Pacific Railroad on December 28, 1917, pursuant to the proclamation of December 26, 1917, 40 Stat. 1733, under the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St.  1974a).1 He was operating it through the Director General under the Federal Control Act (Act March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a- 3115 3\/4 p]) when Ault was employed, when he was discharged and when the judgment under review was entered. See Transportation Act 1920, Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456. The company had claimed seasonably that under the acts of Congress it could not be held liable either for the wages or the penalty and that, if the state and federal statutes should be construed as creating such liability, they were in that respect void as to it under the federal Constitution. The Director General did not contest liability for wages actually due, \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 557]\n\u00a0\n but claimed that under the legislation of Congress he was not liable for the penalty and that the state statute as applied to him was void under the federal Constitution. The claims of both defendants having been denied by the highest court of the state, they brought the case here by writ of error.\n First. The company is clearly not answerable in the present action if the ordinary principles of common law liability are to be applied. The Railraod Administration established by the President in December, 1917, did not exercise its control through supervision of the owner companies, but by means of a Director General through 'one control, one administration, one power for the accomplishment of the one purpose, the complete possession by governmental authority to replace for the period provided the private ownership theretofore existing.' Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 135, 148\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 502, 505 (63 L. Ed. 897). This authority was confirmed by the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, and the ensuing proclamation of March 29, 1918, 40 Stat. 1763. By the establishment of the Railroad Administration and subsequent orders of the Director General, the carrier companies were completely separated from the control and management of their systems. Managing officials were 'required to sever their relations with the particular companies and to become exclusive representatives of the United States Railraod Administration.' U. S. R. R. Adm. Bulletin No. 4, pp. 113, 114, 313. The railway employees were under its direction and were in no way controlled by their former employers. See Bulletin No. 4, p. 168,  5; page 198 et seq.; page 330 et seq. It is obvious, therefore, that no liability arising out of the operation of these systems was imposed by the common law upon the owner companies as their interest in and control over the systems were completely suspended.\n The contention that the company is liable for acts or \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 558]\n\u00a0\n omissions of the Director General in operating the Missouri Pacific Railroad rests wholly upon the following provision of section 10 of the Federal Control Act (section 3115 3\/4 j):2\n'That carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws or at common law, except in so far as may be inconsistent with the provisions of this act or any other act applicable to such federal control or with any order of the President. Actions at law or suits in equity may be brought by and agaisnt such carriers and judgments rendered as now provided by law; and in any action at law or suit in equity against the carrier no defense shall be made thereto upon the ground that the carrier is an instrumentality or agency of the federal government. ... But no process, mesne or final, shall be levied against any property under such federal control.'\n\n It is urged that, since section 10, in terms, continues the liability of 'carriers while under federal control' and permits suit against them, it should be construed as subjecting the companies to liability for acts or omissions of the Railroad Administration although they are deprived of all power over the properties and the personnel. And it is said that this construction would not result in hardship upon the companies since the just compensation provided by the act would include any loss from judgments \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 559]\n\u00a0\n of this sort. Such a radical departure from the established concepts of legal liability would at least approach the verge of constitutional power. It should not be made in the absence of compelling language. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 408\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527. There is none such here.\n The plain purpose of the above provision was to preserve to the general public the rights and remedies agaisnt common carriers which it enjoyed at the time the railroads were taken over by the President except in so far as such rights or remedies might interfere with the needs of federal operation. The provision applies equally to cases where suits against the carrier companies were pending in the courts on December 28, 1917, to cases where the cause of action arose before that date and the suit agaisnt the company was filed after it, and to cases where both cause of action and suit had arisen or might arise during federal operation. The government was to operate the carriers, but the usual immunity of the sovereign from legal liability was not to prevent the enforcement of liabilities ordinarily incident to the operation of carriers. The situation was analogous to that which would exist if there were a general receivership of each transportation system. Operation was to be continued as theretofore with the old personnel, subject to change by executive order. The courts were to go on entertaining suits and entering judgments under existing law, but the property in the hands of the President for war purposes was not to be disturbed. With that exception the substantial legal rights of persons having dealings with the carriers were not to be affected by the change of control.\n This purpose Congress accomplished by providing that 'carriers while under federal control' should remain subject to all then existing laws and liabilities and that they might sue and be sued as therefore. Here the term 'carriers' was used as it is understood in common \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 560]\n\u00a0\n speech; meaning the transportation systems as distinguished from the corporations owning or operating them. Congress had in section 1 (section 3115 1\/4 a) declared that such was its meaning. The President took over the physical properties, the transportation systems, and placed them under a single directing head; but he took them over as entities and they were always dealt with as such (Bull. No. 4, p. 113). Each system was required to file its own tariffs. General Order No. 7, Bull. 4, p. 151. Each was required to take an inventory of its materials and supplies. General Order No. 10, Id. p. 170. Each federal treasurer was to deal with the finances of a single system; his bank account was to be designated '(Name of Railroad), Federal Account.' General Order No. 37, Id. p. 313. Each of 165 systems was named individually in the order promulgating the wage awards of the Railroad Wage Commission. General Order No. 27, Id. pp. 198, 200. And throughout the orders and circulars there are many such expressions as 'two or more railroads or boat lines under federal control.' See General Order No. 11, Id. p. 170.3 It is this conception of a transportation system as an entity which dominates section 10 of the act. The systems are regarded much as ships are regarded in admiralty. They are dealt with as active responsible parties answerable for their own wrongs. But since levy or execution upon their property was precluded as inconsistent with the government's needs, the liability of the transportation \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 561]\n\u00a0\n system was to be enforced by allowing suit to be brought against whomever, as the party operating the same, was legally responsible under existing law, although it be the government.\n Thus, under section 10, if the cause of action arose prior to governmental control, suit might be instituted or continued to judgment against the company as though there had been no taking over by the government, save for the immunity of the physical property from levy and the power of the President to regulate suits in the public interest as by fixing the venue, or the time for trial. \n4\n If the cause of action arose while the government was operating the system, the 'carrier while under federal control' was nevertheless to be liable and suable. This means, as a matter of law, that the government or its agency for operation could be sued, for under the existing law the legal person in control of the carrier was responsible for its acts. See Gracie v. Palmer, 8 Wheat. 605, 632-633. The title by which suit should be brought-the person who should be named as defendant-was not designated in the act. In the absence of explicit direction, it was perhaps natural that those wishing to sue the carrier should have named the company as defendant when they sought to hold the government liable. It doubtless seemed, as suggested in McNulta v. Lochridge, \n141 \nU.S. 327, 331\n, 332 S., 12 Sup. Ct. 11, that suit should be brought agaisnt the transportation company 'by name 'in the hands of' or 'in the possession of' a receiver,' or Director General. All doubt as to how suit should be brought was cleared \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 562]\n\u00a0\n away by General Order No. 50 which required that it be against the Director General by name. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n As the Federal Control Act did not impose any liability upon the companies on any cause of action arising out of the operation of their systems of transportation by the government, the provision in Order No. 50 authorizing the substitution of the Director General as defendant in suits then pending within his power; the application of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company that it be dismissed from this action should have been granted; and the judgment against it should, therefore, be reversed. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[256 U.S. 554, 563]\n\u00a0\n Second. The contention that the Director General, being the carrier, is liable for the penalty imposed by the Arkansas statute is rested specifically upon the clause in section 10 to the effect that the carriers 'shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws or at common law,' and the provision in section 15 (section 3115 3\/4 o) that the 'lawful police regulations of the several states' shall continue unimpaired. By these provisions the United States submitted itself to the various laws, state and federal, which prescribed how the duty of a common carrier by railroad should be performed and what should be the remedy for failure to perform. By these laws the validity and extent of claims against the United States arising out of the operation of the railroad were to be determined. But there is nothing either in the purpose or the letter of these clauses to indicate that Congress intended to authorize suit against the government for a penalty, if it should fail to perform the legal obligations imposed. The government undertook as carrier to observe all existing laws; it undertook to compensate any person injured through a departure by its agents or servants from their duty under such law; but it did not undertake to punish itself for any departure by the imposition upon itself of fines and penalties or to permit any other sovereignty to punish it. Congress is \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 564]\n\u00a0\n not to be assumed to have adopted the method of fines paid out of public funds to insure obedience to the law on the part of the government's railway employees. The Director General adopted a much more effective and direct method:\n'Now that the railroads are in the possession and control of the government, it would be futile to impose fines for violations of said laws and orders upon the government, therefore it will become the duty of the Director General in the enforcement of said laws and orders to impose punishments for willful and inexcusable violations thereof upon the person or persons responsible therefor.' General Order No. 8, Id. p. 167.\n\n The purpose for which the government permitted itself to be sued was compensation, not punishment. In issuing General Order No. 50, the Director General was careful to confine the order to the limits set by the act, by concluding the first paragraph of the order:\n'Provided, however, that this order shall not apply to actions, suits, or proceedings for the recovery of fines, penalties, and forfeitures.'\n\n Wherever the law permitted compensatory damages they may be collected against the carrier while under federal control. Such damages may reasonably include interest and costs. See Hines v. Taylor (Fla.) 84 South. 381. But double damages, penalties and forfeitures, which do not merely compensate but punish, are not within the purview of the statute. See Hines v. Taylor, supra; Jackson-Tweed Lumber Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 113 S. C. 236, 101 S. E. 924. The amount recovered in the present case over and above the wages due and unpaid with interest is in the nature of a punishment. It is called a penalty in the state statute. The Supreme Court of Arkansas had held that it was not technically a penalty, declaring:\n'It is allowed for a double purpose, as a compensation for the delay, and as a punishment for the failure to pay. It is composed of all the elements \n\n[256 U.S. 554, 565]\n\u00a0\n and serves all the purposes of exemplary damages.' Leep v. Railway, 58 Ark. 407, 440, 441, 25 S. W. 75, 85 (23 L. R. A. 264, 41 Am. St. Rep. 109).\n\n But whether in a proceeding against the Director General it shall be deemed compensation or a penalty presents a question not of state, but of federal law. Whatever name be applied, the element of punishment clearly predominates and Congress has not given its consent that suits of this character be brought against the United States. The judgment against the Director General, so far as it provided for recovery of the penalty, was erroneous.\n The case is properly here on writ of error. The petition for writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the merits, is therefore denied.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The President, in time of war, is empowered, through the Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable.' 40 Stat. 645. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The provision in section 10 concerning suits is in substance the same as that contained in the following paragraph of the proclamation of the President of December 26, 1917:\n'Except with the prior written assent of said Director, no attachment by mesne process or on execution shall be levied on or agaisnt any of the property used by any of said transportation systems in the conduct of their business as common carriers; but suits may be brought by and against said carriers and judgments rendered as hitherto until and except so far as said Director may, by general or special orders, otherwise determine.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] By section 12 of the act (section 3115 3\/4 l) receipts from the operation of each carrier are the property of the United States and, unless otherwise directed by the President, they are to be kept in the custody of the same officers and accounted for in the same way as before federal control. Disbursements are to be made from this fund without appropriation in the manner provided by the accounting regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Under those regulations judgments for damages are chargeable to the operation of the railroad and are payable out of the general receipts. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Muir v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co.

Assistant Attorney General Davis, J. Robert Anderson, of Washington, D.

The claimant had been transporting them under an adjustment of compensation that expired on June 30, 1910. In contemplation of the usual quadrennial readjustment by weighing, the Postmaster General sent to the claimant the customary form of Distance Circulars to be filled out and to be accompanied by the latest working schedules of trains operated over the routes concerned. The circular contained this clause:\n'The Company named below agrees to accept and perform mail service upon the conditions prescribed by law and the regulations of the department applicable to Railroad Mail Service.'\n\n The claimant signed the circular protesting against certain regulations, and was answered on June 30, 1910, that the department would not enter into contract with any railroad company by which it might be excepted from the operation or effect of any postal laws or regulations and that it must be understood that from the beginning of the contract term named \n\n[256 U.S. 610, 612]\n\u00a0\n and during the continuance of the service the company would be 'subject, as in the past, to all the postal laws and regulations which are now or may become applicable during the term of the service.' In answer to a reply to this letter it was reiterated that it must be understood that the Company would be 'subject, as in the past, to the usual customs and practices in relation to railroad mail service as well as to the conditions stated in my letter' of June 30, 1910. The weighings took place and on September 15, 1910, by a notice approved by the Postmaster General on September 22, the claimant was informed that the compensation for route No. 153010, (the route chiefly concerned,) had been fixed from July 1, 1910, to June 30, 1914 '(unless otherwise ordered),' at certain sums, 'upon returns showing the amount and character of the service,' for the usual time (ninety working days). The notice added:\n'This adjustment is subject to future orders and to fines and deductions, and is based on a service of not less than six round trips per week.'\n\n This correspondence is relied upon by the claimant as a contract fixing its pay for four years.\n In 1906 the claimant had established a fast mail train from Parsons, Kansas, that connected with the Frisco System train No. 3, at Vinita, Oklahoma, with further connections that carried the mail to Houston, Galveston and San Antonio, Texas. It had guaranteed the maintenance of the service until July 1, 1910, and was maintaining it at the time of the readjustment in that year. Its return on the Distance Circular for route No. 153010 showed Vinita as a station where mails were put on and put off trains, and the adjustment showed allowances for mails from Parsons to Vinita and from Vinita to Texas. The claimant gave no notice that the fast train would be discontinued. Early in 1912, however, it was discontinued, the Postoffice Department protesting that it was a violation of contract, and being compelled thereby to \n\n[256 U.S. 610, 613]\n\u00a0\n make other provisions for the mails concerned. Thereafter, on November 22, 1912, the Department ordered the mails diverted to other lines to be weighed for twenty-one days beginning on November 26, so far as such mails could be definitely identified, the mail not to be weighed in case of doubt-that provision of course being favorable to the road. The result was an order of February 13, 1913, approved by the Postmaster on March 1, 1913, by which the compensation on route No. 153010 was diminished by $10,914.04 a year, from July 1, 1912, and that of two other routes increased by $6, 199.08. The claimant contending that the whole proceeding was illegal sues for the difference between the new and the old allowance for the two years when the new order was enforced.\n The Government justifies the Department's course under the arrangement that we have recited, the previously existing law and the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 389,  4, 37 Stat. 539, 554 (Comp. St.  7493).\n'When, after a weighing of the mails for the purpose of readjusting the compensation for their transportation on a railroad route, mails are diverted therefrom or thereto, the Postmaster General may, in his discretion, ascertain the effect of such diversion by a weighing of such mails for such number of successive working days as he may determine, and have the weights stated and verified to him as in other cases, and readjust the compensation on the routes affected accordingly: Provided, That no readjustment shall be made unless the diverted mails equal at least ten per centum of the average daily weight on any of the routes affected: Provided further, That readjustment made hereunder shall not take effect before July first, nineteen hundred and twelve, and shall be for diversons occurring after January first nineteen hundred and twelve.'\n\n The claimant contends that it had a contract that could not be affected by this statute and that the statute was not followed in what was done.\n The contention that the arrangement between the Department \n\n[256 U.S. 610, 614]\n\u00a0\n and the claimant was a contract that the statute could not affect is sufficiently answered by Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. United States, \n249 U.S. 385\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 348, and The Mail Divisor Cases, \n251 U.S. 326\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 162, coupled with the express notice that the railroad would be 'subject to all the postal laws and regulations which are now or may become applicable during the term of the service.' Moreover it is an extravagant interpretation of the adjustment to suppose that the railroad could discontinue an important item of the services upon which the compensation was computed, and still demand the same pay.\n The construction of the statute also seems to us to be tolerably plain upon the points mainly argued. The effect of the diversion of mails may be ascertained by 'a weighing of such mails' (that is, very plainly, the diverted ones) for such number of days as the Postmaster General may determine. This is not a recurrence to the expensive quadrennial weighing for ninety days but a limited investigation for a limited purpose. The result of the last general weighing, which is sufficient to afford a satisfactory basis for payment, is accepted by the statute as a near enough basis for the ten per cent. test that it creates; the object of the test being merely to show that the diversion has been substantial. The ratio fixed had no other importance than to indicate a case for readjustment and was not necessary even for that, as was shown by the repeal of the proviso in a few years. Act of May 18, 1916, c. 126,  5, 39 Stat. 159, 161.\n The statute itself contemplates a readjustment in respect of past services, since it was not approved until August 24, 1912, and allows a readjustment from the first of the previous July. As the change in the pay is made in respect of a change that has occurred in the service by which the current pay was fixed, the railroad suffers no injustice, and, as we have said, by the terms of its arrangement it took the risk of such a statute being passed. \n\n[256 U.S. 610, 615]\n\u00a0\n There is an ambiguity in the words 'ten per centum on any of the routes affected.' The railroad seems to have contended that they required the diverted mails to equal ten per cent. of the average daily weight on all of the routes affected. The Department construed them to mean that it was enough if the diversion amounted to the ten per cent. on any one of the routes. The first interpretation that occurs to a reader may be that the routes are considered separately and that no readjustment shall be made in respect of any route unless the diversion on the route equals ten per cent. But the routes mentioned are supposed to be all affected by the same diversion and therefore are considered collectively. If a readjustment is made as to one route it is reasonable to take into account the offsets on others arising from the same change. That being so there is a literal plausibility in the railroad's contention-but having in mind what we have suggested to be the only purpose of the requirement, we are disposed to accept the construction adopted by the Department and the Court of Claims, that the statute denies a readjustment only if the diverted mails do not equal ten per cent. of the average daily weight upon any, that is, upon some one of the routes. If the proviso had meant them to amount to ten per cent. upon all the routes, 'all' not 'any' is the word that naturally would have been used.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL BRAKE & ELECTRIC CO. v.

Afterwards, on August 19, 1918, the Brake & Electric Company presented and filed a motion and petition upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, rendered the decree which is now the subject of review.\n The petition alleges that the decree in the Pennsylvania suit was one presenting the same issues as were presented and considered in the Wisconsin suit; that the plaintiffs were the same, and the defendants were in privity; that in the Pennsylvania suit it was adjudged, in accordance with the mandate issued by direction of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit that patent No. 635,280 was issued without warrant, and that the bill of complaint as to that patent should accordingly be dismissed; that upon further proceedings had in the Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit and the District Court in Pennsylvania as to patent No. 621,234 the bill upon that patent was dismissed for want of prosecution. A transcript of the proceedings in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania was presented, and petitioner stated that it was advised that the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin had no power or authority without the assent of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to entertain the motion or application to set aside or modify the former decree of such District Court affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but that the Circuit Court of Appeals had such jurisdiction and power, and that because of the final adjudication in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania the suit in the District Court of the Eastern District of Wisconsin should be dismissed on the \n\n[254 U.S. 425, 429]\n\u00a0\n motion of the petitioner. The petition recited the proceedings in the District Court of Wisconsin, and the fact that that court was proceeding to take an accounting under the former decree. The prayer of the petition was that the Circuit Court of Appeals take jurisdiction of the petition, and inquire into and determine the status of the case, and the force and effect of the final judgment of the District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and hold the same to be a final adjudication, and that the petitioner was entitled to a final decree in the suit in Wisconsin dismissing the same for want of equity; that the District Court be directed to proceed and act accordingly, and the court was asked to issue such orders in the premises, and such writ or writs of certiorari or otherwise as might be necessary or proper, and such further and different orders, directions, writs, or relief as should seem proper or necessary.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to grant any relief upon the petition, holding that the decree of the Wisconsin court was final in its character, notwithstanding it was interlocutory in form, and that the decree in the Third Circuit could not be set up as res judicata between the parties. 258 Fed. 880, 169 C. C. A. 880. From that decree the writ of certiorari brings the case to this court.\n It thus appears that in a suit upon a patent, and one subsequently issued alleged to be for the same invention, Christensen had obtained a decree in the Wisconsin District Court sustaining the right to a patent monopoly and an accounting. From this decree appeal had been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, where the decree was affirmed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, where the accounting was in progress. Subsequently Christensen brought the suit in Pennsylvania upon the patent rights in controversy which resulted in a decree which, it is contended, \n\n[254 U.S. 425, 430]\n\u00a0\n is binding upon Christensen, and res judicata as to the invalidity of the patent.\n In such case the Brake & Electric Company, if it wished to avail itself of the Pennsylvania decree, had the right to apply by petition in the Appellate Court of the Seventh Circuit for leave to file a bill in the court of original jurisdiction in the nature of a bill of review, setting up the new matter as a bar to further proceedings. Such applications are addressed to the sound discretion of the appellate tribunal, and should be decided upon considerations addressed to the materiality of the new matter and diligence in its presentation. Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 805; In re Gamewell Co., 73 Fed. 908, 20 C. C. A. 111: Keith v. Alger, 124 Fed. 32, 59 C. C. A. 552; Society of Shakers v. Watson, 77 Fed. 512, 23 C. C. A. 263.\n The matter was considered in Re Potts, \n166 U.S. 263\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 520, where this court reversed a decree of the Circuit Court dismissing a bill upon a patent, holding that the patent was valid and had been infringed by the defendant, and remanding the cause to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. It was held that the Circuit Court had no authority to grant or entertain a petition filed without leave of this court for a rehearing for newly discovered evidence, and that mandamus was the proper remedy to set aside the order of the Circuit Court failing to execute the mandate of this court. The authorities were reviewed by Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court. Among other things he said:\n'In this respect, a motion for a new trial or a petition for a rehearing stands upon the same ground as a bill of review, as to which Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for this court, in Southard v. Russell, above cited, said: 'Nor will a bill of review lie in the case of newly discovered evidence after the publication, or decree below, where a decision has taken place on an appeal, unless the right is reserved in the decree of the appellate court, or permission be given on an application to \n\n[254 U.S. 425, 431]\n\u00a0\n that court directly for the purpose. This appears to be the practice of the Court of Chancery and House of Lords, in England; and we think it founded in principles essential to the proper administration of the law, and to a reasonable termination of litigation between the parties in chancery suits.' 16 How. 570, 571. So, in United States v. Knight, 1 Black, 488, 489, Chief Justice Taney said that, in a case brought before this court exercising general jurisdiction in chancery, 'the defeated party, upon the discovery of new evidence, may, after a final decree in this court, obtain leave here to file a bill of review in the court below to review the judgment which this court had rendered.'\n\n In Re Potts it was held that, unless application was made to this court within 20 days for leave to file a petition for a rehearing in the Circuit Court, the writ of mandamus would issue as prayed.\n In Potts & Co. v. Creager, 97 Fed. 78, 79, 38 C. C. A. 47, it appears from the statement of subsequent proceedings in the case that this court upon application granted leave to file a petition for rehearing in the Circuit Court.\n That leave to file a supplemental petition in the nature of a bill of review may be granted after the judgment of the appellate court, and after the going down of the mandate at the close of the term at which judgment was rendered, was held in Re Gamewell Co., 73 Fed. 908, 20 C. C. A. 111, in a carefully considered opinion rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, reciting the previous consideration of the question in cases in this court. We think these cases settle the proper practice in applications of this nature.\n This case is unlike the one before us in Hart Steel Co. v. Railroad Supply Co., \n244 U.S. 294\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 506, in which it was held that a decree in a patent infringement suit affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, while a like decree was pending but not yet heard before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, upon a \n\n[254 U.S. 425, 432]\n\u00a0\n motion seasonably made in the latter Court of Appeals, should have been held to be res judicata because of the legal identity of the subject matter and privity of the parties.\n In the instant case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, treating the application as an original petition to have the decree made in the Third Circuit pronounced res judicata, held that the former decree in the Seventh Circuit was final, and denied the prayer of the petition.\n In our view the proper practice in matters of this sort required the Circuit Court of Appeals to regard the petition, taking all its allegations together, and with its prayer for general relief, as an application for leave to file in the District Court a petition in the nature of a bill of review invoking a consideration of the effect of the judgment in the Third Circuit. Such consideration the Circuit Court of Appeals may well be directed to undertake in the exercise of its proper function in determining the rights of the parties, and for that purpose its judgment should be reversed, without passing in this court upon the merits of the petition. This procedure is sanctioned by former decisions of this court. Lutcher & Moore Co. v. Knight, \n217 U.S. 257\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 505; Cramp v. Curtiss Co., \n228 U.S. 646\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 722; Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 U.S. 583\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 750.\n A motion was made to dismiss the writ of certiorari upon the ground that this case is one in which an appeal might have been had. But we are of opinion that in view of the nature of the application, and the status of the case brought for infringement of the patents in question, the proceeding was not of that character in which an appeal would lie to this court. We held in McFadden v. United States, \n213 U.S. 288\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 490, that the line of division between cases appealable from the Circuit Court of Appeals and those made final in that court was determined by the \n\n[254 U.S. 425, 433]\n\u00a0\n source of original jurisdiction of the trial court, and not by the nature of the questions of law raised or decided.\n In our view the petition filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals was ancillary to the original jurisdiction invoked, and was still in its essence and nature a suit involving the validity of a patent, which is expressly made final in the Circuit Court of Appeals, subject to the right of this court to review by writ of certiorari.\n It follows that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings upon the petition filed by the National Brake & Electric Company in conformmity with the opinion of this court.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW ORLEANS LAND CO. v.

No. 30 of 1871, James W. Peake, of New York, instituted a second suit in the United States Circuit Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, May 30, 1891, against New Orleans, seeking sale of land which that city held as trustee to secure all such warrants. See Peake v. New Orleans (1891) \n139 U.S. 342\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 541. Neither the appellee nor any of its predecessors in interest was party to the proceeding. By direction of the court a duly appointed receiver sold the land, January 15, 1892, to Dr. Gaudet, who shortly thereafter transferred it to appellant, a Louisiana corporation, which took immediate possession.\n Setting up superior title to some of the land under patent from the state issued June 3, 1874, appellee, also a Louisiana corporation, brought suit against appellant in the state court December 8, 1909, and obtained a favorable judgment, afterwards affirmed by the Supreme Court. Leader Realty Co. v. New Orleans Land Co., 142 La. 169, 76 South. 599. Thereupon appellant began this proceeding to restrain enforcement of the judgment of the state court or interference with its possession, and alleged that the District Court's jurisdiction was invoked solely in aid of the decree for sale in Peake v. New Orleans. No diversity of citizenship existed, and, deeming the bill not ancillary, but original, the court below dismissed it for want of jurisdiction.\n'The rule is well settled that a sale of real estate under judicial proceedings concludes no one who is not in some form a party to such proceedings.'

New Orleans ( 1891) was not a proceeding in rem to which all persons having an interest in the land \n\n[255 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n were deemed parties with the right to intervene. Its only purpose was to secure sale and transfer of such right and title as the city held. Rights of third parties were not subject to adjudication therein. High on Receivers (4th Ed.)  199a. The subsequent action by the state court did not interfere with anything done by the federal court (Dupasseur v.

Ct. 399, and similar cases are not pertinent). Their purpose was to protect or enforce some right theretofore duly adjudicated, while here the defendant's claim in no way conflicts with any right arising under the former adjudication, and nothing is required in order to render that effectual.\n\n The decree below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT. & H.

Taylor, of Boston, Mass., for York & Whitney Co.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Neither party was wholly successful in the courts below. 230 Mass. 206, 119 N. E. 855 (May 24, 1918). Each has \n\n[256 U.S. 406, 407]\n\u00a0\n asked and obtained a writ of error and also a writ of certiorari. The latter properly bring the issues before us, and the former must be dismissed.\n The railroad company as terminal carrier sued York & Whitney Company, a commission merchant, to recover the balance claimed for freight and refrigeration on nine carloads of melons, vegetables, and fruit consigned to the latter, subject to lawful charges, and delivered at Boston during the years 1911 and 1912. They were shipped in interstate commerce upon straight bills of lading approved as to form by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but none of these came into the consignee's possession and it had no knowledge of their issuance or terms.\n When York & Whitney Company accepted the cars it paid all charges claimed. The merchandise was sold at once and the net proceeds remitted to the shippers. Later the railroad company discovered that it had collected less than lawful rates established under the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379), and thereupon demanded the balance alleged to be due by reason of such undercharges. Maintaining it had accepted the shipments upon the understanding that the charges were as reported, and had not agreed to pay more, York & Whitney Company refused the demand.\n Commission merchants often receive from strangers shipments of perishable articles for sale at market prices. Under a trade custom such things are promptly disposed of and the net proceeds remitted to the consignors. Successful conduct of the business requires prompt settlements. The court below low held that whether York & Whitney Company impliedly agreed to pay the rates imposed by law was a question of fact to be determined upon consideration of all the circumstances. It accordingly approved a judgment, entered upon a verdict, favorable to that company as to charges upon one carload \n\n[256 U.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n (No. 280), and in behalf of the railroad for those claimed on account of eight carloads (No. 281).\n We think the doctrine announced in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. v. Fink, \n250 U.S. 577\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 27 ( November 10, 1919) is controlling, and that the liability of York & Whitney company was a question of law. The transaction between the parties amounted to an assumption by the consignee to pay the only lawful rate it had the right to pay or the carrier the right to charge. The consignee could not escape the liability imposed by law through any contract with the carrier.\n The judgment of the court below in No. 280, so far as challenged, must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The judgment in No. 281, so far as challenged, is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK TRUST CO. v.

St.  6336 1\/2 b), and paid under duress on December 14, 1917. According to the complaint Purdy died leaving a will and codicil directing that all succession, inheritance and transfer taxes should be paid out of the residuary estate, which was bequeathed to the descendants of his brother. The value of the residuary estate was $427,414.96, subject to some administration expenses. The executors had been required to pay and had paid inheritance and succession taxes to New York ($32,988.97) and other States ($4,780.91) amounting in all to $37,769.88. The gross estate as defined in section 202 of the Act of Congress (Comp. St.  6336 1\/2 c) was $769,799.39; funeral expenses and expenses of administration, except the above taxes, $61,322.08; leaving a net value for the payment of legacies, except as reduced by the taxes of the United States, of $670,707.43. The plaintiffs were compelled to pay $ 23,910.77 to the United States, no deduction of any part of the above mentioned $37,769.88 being allowed. They allege that the Act of Congress is unconstitutional, and also that it was misconstrued in not allowing a deduction of state inheritance and succession taxes as charges within the meaning of section 203 (section 6336 1\/2 d). On demurrer the District Court dismissed the suit.\n By section 201 of the Act, 'a tax ... equal to the following percentages of the value of the net estate, to be \n\n[256 U.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n determined as provided in section two hundred and three, is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act.' with percentages rising from one per centum of the amount of the net estate not in excess of $50,000 to ten per centum of the amount in excess of $5,000,000. Section 202 gives the mode of determining the value of the gross estate. Then, by section 203 it is enacted:\n'That for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined-(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the gross estate-(1) Such amounts for funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, losses incurred during the settlement of the estate arising from fires, storms, shipwreck, or other casualty, and from theft, when such losses are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, support during the settlement of the estate of those dependent upon the decedent, and such other charges against the estate, as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered; and ( 2) an exemption of $50,000.'\n\n The tax is to be due in one year after the decedent's death. Section 204 (section 6336 1\/2 e). Within thirty days after qualifying the executor is to give written notice to the collector and later to make return of the gross estate, deductions allowed, net estate and the tax payable thereon. Section 205 (section 6336 1\/2 f). The executor is to pay the tax. Section 207 (section 6336 1\/2 h). The tax is a lien for ten years on the gross estate except such part as is paid out for allowed charges, section 209 ( section 6336 1\/2j), and if not paid within sixty days after it is due is to be collected by a suit to subject the decedent's property to be sold, section 208 (section 6336 1\/2 i). In case of collection from some person other than the executor, the same section provides for contribution from or marshalling of persons subject to equal or prior liability 'it being the purpose and intent of this title that so far as is practicable and unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent the tax \n\n[256 U.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n shall be paid out of the estate before its distribution.' These provisions are assailed by the plaintiffs in error as an unconstitutional interference with the rights of the States to regulate descent and distribution, as unequal and as a direct tax not apportioned as the Constitution requires.\n The statement of the constitutional objections urged imports on its face a distinction that, if correct, evidently hitherto has escaped this Court. See United States v. Field, Feb. 28, 1921, \n255 U.S. 257\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 256. It is admitted, as since Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747, it has to be, that the United States has power to tax legacies, but it is said that this tax is cast upon a transfer while it is being effectuated by the State itself and therefore is an intrusion upon its processes, whereas a legacy tax is not imposed until the process is complete. An analogy is sought in the difference between the attempt of a State to tax commerce among the States and its right after the goods have become mingled with the general stock in the State. A consideration of the parallel is enough to detect the fallacy. A tax that was directed solely against goods imported into the State and that was determined by the fact of importation would be no better after the goods were at rest in the State than before. It would be as much as interference with commerce in one case as in the other. I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, \n208 U.S. 113\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 247; Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n. Conversely if a tax on the property distributed by the laws of a State, determined by the fact that distribution has been accomplished, is valid, a tax determined by the fact that distribution is about to begin is no greater interference and is equally good.\n Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747, dealt, it is true, with a legacy tax. But the tax was met with the same objection; that it usurped or interfered with the exercise of state powers, and the answer to the objection was based upon general considerations and treated the 'power to transmit \n\n[256 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n or the transmission or receipt of property by death' as all standing on the same footing. \n178 \nU.S. 57, 59\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 747. After the elaborate discussion that the subject received in that case we think it unnecessary to dwell upon matters that in principle were disposed of there. The same may be said of the argument that the tax is direct and therefore is void for want of apportionment. It is argued that when the tax is on the privilege of receiving the tax is indirect because it may be avoided, whereas here the tax is inevitable and therefore direct. But that matter also is disposed of by Knowlton v. Moore, not by an attempt to make some scientific distinction, which would be at least difficult, but on an interpretion of language by its traditional use-on the practical and historical ground that this kind of tax always has been regarded as the antithesis of a direct tax; 'has ever been treated as a duty or excise, because of the particular occasion which gives rise to its levy.' \n178 U.S. 81\n-83, 20 Sup. Ct. 747. Upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\n The inequalities charged upon the statute, if there is an intestacy, are all inequalities in the amounts that beneficiaries might receive in case of estates of different values, of different proportions between real and personal estate, and of different numbers of recipients; or if there is a will affect legatees. As to the inequalities in case of a will they must be taken to be contemplated by the testator. He knows the law and the consequences of the disposition that he makes. As to intestate successors the tax is not imposed upon them but precedes them and the fact that they may receive less or different sums because of the statute does not concern the United States.\n There remains only the construction of the Act. The argument against its constitutionality is based upon a premise that is unfavorable to the contention of the plaintiffs in error upon this point. For if the tax attaches to the estate before distribution-if it is a tax on the right \n\n[256 U.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n to transmit, or on the transmission at its beginning, obviously it attaches to the whole estate except so far as the statute sets a limit. 'Charges against the estate' as pointed out by the Court below are only charges that affect the estate as a whole, and therefore do not include taxes on the right of individual beneficiaries. This reasoning excludes not only the New York succession tax but those paid to other States, which can stand no better than that paid in New York. What amount New York may take as the basis of taxation and questions of priority between the United States and the State are not open in this case.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEWBERRY v.

St. 195), the federal Corrupt Practices Act, which provides:\n'No candidate for Representative in Congress or for Senator of the United States shall give, contribute, expend, use, or promise, or cause to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised, in procuring his nomination and election any sum, in the aggregate, in excess of the amount which he may lawfully give, contribute, expend, or promise under the laws of the state in which he resides: Provided, that no candidate for Representative in Congress shall give, contribute, expend, use, or promise any sum, in the aggregate, exceeding five thousand dollars in any campaign for his nomination and election; and no candidate for Senator of the United States shall give, contribute, expend, use, or promise any sum, in the aggregate, exceeding ten thousand dollars in any campaign for his nomination and election:\n\n'Provided further, that money expended by any such candidate to meet and discharge any assessment, fee, or charge made or levied upon candidates by the laws of the state in which he resides, or for his necessary personal expenses, incurred for himself alone, for travel and subsistence, stationery \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 244]\n\u00a0\n and postage, writing or printing (other than in newspapers), and distributing letters, circulars, and posters, and for telegraph and telephone service, shall not be regarded as an expenditure within the meaning of this section, and shall not be considered any part of the sum herein fixed as the limit of expense and need not be shown in the statements herein required to be filed.' Comp. St.  195(7).\n\n Act No. 109, Sec. I, Michigan Legislature, 1913, prohibits expenditure by or on behalf of a candidate, to be paid by him, in securing his nomination, of any sum exceeding 25 per centum of one year's compensation; and puts like limitation upon expenditures to obtain election after nomination. Section I is copied below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Taken with the state enactment, the federal statute in effect declares a candidate for the United States Senate punishable by fine and imprisonment, if (except for certain \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 245]\n\u00a0\n specified purposes) he give, contribute, expend, use, promise or cause to be given, contributed, expended, used or promised in procuring his nomination and election more than $3,750-one-half of one year's salary. Under the construction of the act urged by the government and adopted by the court below it is not necessary that the inhibited sum be paid, promised or expended by the candidate himself, or be devoted to any secret or immoral purpose. For example, its open and avowed contribution and use by supporters upon suggestion by him or with his approval and cooperation in order to promote public discussion and debate touching vital questions or to pay necessary expenses of speakers, etc., is enough. And upon such interpretation the conviction below was asked and obtained.\n The indictment charges: That Truman H Newberry became a candidate for the Republican nomination for United States Senator from Michigan at the primary election held August 27, 1918; that by reason of selection and nomination therein he became a candidate at the general election, November 5, 1918; that he and 134 others (who are named) at divers times from December 1, 1917, to November 5, 1918, unlawfully and feloniously did conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together to commit the offense on his part of wilfully violating the Act of Congress approved June 25, 1910, as amended, by giving, contributing, expending, and using and by causing to be given, contributed, expended and used, in produring his nomination and election at said primary and general elections, a greater sum than the lawsof Michigan permitted and above ten thousand dollars, to wit, $100,000, and on thepart of the other defendants of aiding, counseling, inducing, and procuring Newberry as such candidate to give, contribute, expend, and use or cause to be given, contributed, expended and used said large and excessive sum in order to procure his nomination \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 246]\n\u00a0\n and election. Plaintiffs in error were convicted under count one, set out in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[256 U.S. 232, 247]\n\u00a0\n The court below overruled a duly interposed demurrer which challenged the constitutionality of section 8; and by so doing we think fell into error.\n Manifestly, this section applies not only to final elections for choosing Senators but also to primaries and conventions of political parties for selection of candidates. Michigan and many other states undertake to control these primaries by statutes and give recognition to their results. And the ultimate question for solution here is whether under the grant of power to regulate 'the manner of holding elections' Congress may fix the maximum sum which a candidate therein may spend, or advise or cause to be contributed and spent by others to procure his nomination.\n Section 4, article 1, of the Constitution provides:\n'The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 248]\n\u00a0\n by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.'\n\n Here is the source of Congressional power over the elections specified. It has been so declared by this court-Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n; United States v. Gradwell \n243 \nU.S. 476, 481\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 407-and the early discussions clearly show that this was then the accepted opinion. The Federalist, LVIII, LIX, LX; Elliot's Debates, vol. II, 50, 73, 311; volume III, 86, 183, 344, 375; volume IV, 75, 78, 211. \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 249]\n\u00a0\n We find no support in reason or authority for the argument that because the offices were created by the Constitution, Congress has some indefinite, undefined power over elections for Senators and Representatives not derived from section 4.\n'The government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the Constitution, and the powers actually granted, must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication.' Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 ( 4 L. Ed. 97).\n\n Clear constitutional provisions also negative any possible inference of such authority because of the supposed anomaly 'if one government had the unrestricted power to control matters affecting the choice of the officers of another.' Mr. Iredell (afterwards of this court) in the North Carolina Convention of 1788, pointed out that the states may-must indeed- exert some unrestricted control over the federal government:\n'The very existence of the general government depends on that of the state governments. The state Legislatures are to choose the senators. Without a Senate there can be no Congress. The state Legislatures are also to direct the manner of choosing the President. Unless, therefore, there are state Legislatures to direct that manner, no President can be chosen. The same observation may be made as to the House of Representatives, since, as they are to be chosen by the electors of the most numerous branch of each state Legislature. If there are no state Legislatures, there are no persons to choose the House of Representatives. Thus it is evident that the very existence of the general government depends on that of the state Legislatures.' Elliot's Debates, vol. IV, p. 78.\n\n See also The Federalist, XLIV.\n The federal features of our government are so clear and have been so often declared that no valuable discussion can proceed upon the opposite assumption.\n Undoubtedly elections within the original intendment \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 250]\n\u00a0\n of section 4 were those wherein Senators should be chosen by Legislatures and Representatives by voters possessing 'the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state Legislature.' Article 1 ,  2 and 3. The Seventeenth Amendment, which directs that Senators be chosen by the people, neither announced nor requires a new meaning of election and the word now has the same general significance as it did when the Constitution came into existence-final choice of an officer by the duly qualified electors. Hawke v. Smith, \n253 U.S. 221\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 495. Primaries were then unknown. Moreover, they are in no sense elections for an office but merely methods by which party adherents agree upon candidates whom they intend to offer and support for ultimate choice by all qualified electors. General provisions touching elections in Constitutions or statutes are not necessarily applicable to primaries-the two things are radically different. And this view has been declared by many state courts. People v. Cavanaugh, 112 Cal. 674, 44 Pac. 1057; State v. Erickson, 119 Minn. 152, 137 N. W. 385; State v. Taylor, 220 Mo. 618, 119 S. W. 373; State v. Woodruff, 68 N. J. Law, 89, 52 Atl. 294; Commonwealth v. Wells, 110 Pa. 463, 1 Atl. 310; Ledgerwood v. Pitts, 122 Tenn. 570, 125 S. W. 1036\n\n\n Sundry provisions of the Constitution indicate plainly enough what its framers meant by elections and the 'manner of holding' them:\n'The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states.' Article 1,  2, cl. 1.\n\n'No person shall be a Representative ... who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of the state in which he shall be chosen.' Article 1,  2, cl. 2.\n\n'When vacancies happen in the representation from any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.' Article 1,  2, cl. 4.\n\n'Immediately after they [the Senators] shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes.' Article 1,  3, cl. 2.\n\n'No person \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 251]\n\u00a0\n shall be a Senator ... who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.' Article 1,  3, cl. 3.\n\n'Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members.' Article 1,  5, cl. 1.\n\n'No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office,' etc. Article 1,  6, cl. 2.\n\n'The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows.' Article 2,  1, cl. 1.\n\n'The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected.' Article 2,  1, cl. 6.\n\n And provisions in the Seventeenth Amendment are of like effect.\n The plain words of the Seventeenthe Amendment and those portions of the original Constitution directly affected by it, should be kept in mind. Article 1,  31:\n'The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes. ... And if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.'\n\n Seventeenth Amendment:\n'The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state Legislatures. When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 252]\n\u00a0\n issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the Legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointment until the people fill the vacancies by election as the Legislature may direct. This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.'\n\n As finally submitted and adopted the amendment does not undertake to modify article 1,  4, the source of congressional power to regulate the times, places and manner of holding elections. That section remains 'intact and applicable both to the election of Representatives and Senators.' Cong. Rec. vol. 46, p. 848. When first reported, January 11, 1911, by Senator Borah for the Judiciary Committee, the proposed Seventeenth Amendment contained a clause providing:\n'The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators shall be as prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof'\n\n -the avowed purpose being thereby to modify section 4, art. 1. by depriving Congress of power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators. (A copy of the oridinal resolution as presented to the Senate is in the margin.)3 \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 253]\n\u00a0\n Upon recommendation of a minority of the Judiciary Committee this clause was eliminated and reference to section 4, art. 1, omitted from the resolution. After prolonged debate in the 61st and 62d Congresses the amendment in its present form was submitted for ratification. See Sen. Rep. 961, 61st Cong. 3d Sess; Sen. Rep. 35, 62d Cong., 1st Sess.; Cong. Rec. vol. 46, pp. 847, 851, et seq.; volume 47, passim, and pp. 1924, 1925, 6366.\n Apparently because deemed unimportant, no counsel on either side referred to 'An act providing a temporary method of conducting the nomination and election of United States Senators,' approved June 4, 1914 ( chapter 103, 38 Stat. 384). To show its irrelevancy and prevent misapprehension, the act is copied in the margin. \n4\n Section \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 254]\n\u00a0\n 2, which contains the only reference to nomination of candidates for Senator, expired by express limitation June 4, 1917, more than a year prior to the conduct here challenged. The act has no criminal provisions, makes no reference to the earlier statute upon which this prosecution is founded and sheds no light on the power of Congress to regulate primaries and conventions. Its terms indicate intention that the machinery for designating party candidates shall remain under state control. But in no view can an attempt to exercise power be treated as conclusive evidence that Congress possesses such power. Otherwise serious discussion of constitutional limitations must cease. Moreover, the criminal statute now relied upon antedates the Seventeenth Amendment and must be tested by powers possessed at time of its enactment. An after-acquired power can not ex proprio vigore validate a statute void when enacted. See Sutherland, Stat. Constr. (2d Ed.) vol. 1,  107.\n A concession that the Seventeenth Amendment might \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 255]\n\u00a0\n be applicable in this controversy if assisted by appropriate legislation would be unimportant, since there is none. Section 2, Act of June 4, 1914, had expired by express limitation many months before Newberry became a candidate, and counsel very properly disregarded it.\n Because deemed appropriate in order effectively to regulate the manner of holding general elections, this court has upheld federal statutes providing for supervisors and prohibiting interference with them, declaring criminal failure by election officers to perform duties imposed by the state and denouncing conspiracies to prevent voters from freely casting their ballots or having them counted. Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n; Ex parte Clarke, \n100 U.S. 399\n; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 U.S. 651\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 152; In re Coy, \n127 U.S. 731\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1263; United States v. Mosley, \n238 U.S. 383\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 904. These enactments had direct and immediate reference to elections by the people, and decisions sustaining them do not control the present controversy. Congress clearly exercised its power to regulate the manner of holding an election when it directed that voting must be by written or printed ballot or voting machines. 30 Stat. 836, c. 154 (Comp. St.  24).\n Section 4, art. 1, was bitterly attacked in the state conventions of 1787-1789, because of its alleged possible use to create preferred classes and finally to destroy the states. In defense, the danger incident to absolute control of elections by the states and the express limitations upon the power were dwelt upon. Mr. Hamilton asserted:\n'The truth is that there is no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended, but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect, or be elected. But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government. Its authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the times, the places, and the manner of elections. The qualifications of the persons who may choose, or be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are defined and fixed \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 256]\n\u00a0\n in the Constitution, and are unalterable by the Legislature.' The Federalist, LIX, LI.\n\n The history of the times indicates beyond reasonable doubt that, if the Constitution makers had claimed for this section the latitude we are now asked to sanction, it would not have been ratified. See Story on the Const.  814 et seq.\n Out immediate concern is with the clause which grants power by law to regulate the 'manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives' (Const. art. 1,  4)-not broadly to regulate them. As an incident to the grant there is, of course, power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying it into effect. Article 1,  8. Although the Seventeenth Amendment now requires Senators to be chosen by the people, reference to the original plan of selection by the Legislatures may aid in interpretation.\n Who should participate in the specified elections was clearly indicated-members of state Legislatures and those having 'the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state Legislature.' Who should be eligible for election was also stated:\n'No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the Unites States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.' Article 1,  2, cl. 2.\n\n'No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained, to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.' Article 1,  3, cl. 3.\n\n Two Senators were allotted to each state and the method was prescribed for determining the number of Representatives. Subject to these important limitations, Congress was empowered by law to regulate the times, places and manner of holding the elections, except as to the places of choosing Senators. 'These words are used without any veiled or obscure significance,' but in their natural and usual sense. \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 257]\n\u00a0\n If it be practically true that under present conditions a designated party candidate is necessary for an election-a preliminary thereto- nevertheless his selection is in no real sense part of the manner of holding the election. This does not depend upon the scheme by which candidates are put forward. Whether the candidate be offered through primary, or convention, or petition, or request of a few, or as the result of his own unsupported ambition does not directly affect the manner of holding the election. Birth must precede but it is no part of either funeral or apotheosis.\n Many things are prerequisites to elections or may affect their outcome-voters, education, means of transportation, health, public discussion, immigration, private animosities, even the face and figure of the candidate; but authority to regulate the manner of holding them gives no right to control and of these. It is settled, e. g., that the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce does not reach whatever is essential thereto. Without agriculture, manufacture, mining, etc., commerce could not exist but this fact does not suffice to subject them to the control of Congress. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 U.S. 1\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 6.\n Elections of Senators by state Legislatures presupposed selection of their members by the people; but it would hardly be argued that therefore Congress could regulate such selection. In the Constitutional Convention of 1787 when replying to the suggestion that state Legislatures should have uncontrolled power over elections of members of Congress, Mr. Madison said:\n'It seems as improper in principle, though it might be less inconvenient in practice, to give to the state Legislatures this great authority over the election of the representatives of the people in the general Legislature as it would be to give to the latter a like power over the election of their representatives in the state Legislatures.' Supplement to Elliot's Debates, vol. V, p. 402. \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 258]\n\u00a0\n We cannot conclude that authority to control party primaries or conventions for designating candidates was bestowed on Congress by the grant of power to regulate the manner of holding elections. The fair intendment of the words does not extend so far; the framers of the Constitution did not ascribe to them any such meaning. Nor is this control necessary in order to effectuate the power expressly granted. On the other hand, its exercise would interfere with purely domestic affairs of the state and infringe upon liberties reserved to the people.\n\n It should not be forgotten that, exercising inherent police power, the state may suppress whatever evils may be incident to primary or convention. As 'each house shall be the judge of the elections, qualifications and returns of its own members,' and as Congress may by law regulate the times, places and manner of holding elections, the national government is not without power to protect itself against corruption, fraud or other malign influences.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA concurs in this opinion as applied to the statute under consideration which was enacted prior to the Seventeenth Amendment; but he reserves the question of the power of Congress under that amendment.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE, dissenting from the opinion, but concurring with a modification in the judgment of reversal.\n The conviction and sentence under review were based on an indictment charging a conspiracy to commit violation \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 259]\n\u00a0\n of the act of Congress known as the Corrupt Practices Act as made applicable to state laws dealing with state nominating primaries for and the ensuing state elections of United States Senators and Representatives in Congress. The case is here by direct appeal because of the contention that primaries of that character are not subject to the regulating power of Congress, and as an incident there is involved the contention, that even if the act of Congress was constitutional it had been prejudicially misconstrued. Sustaining the first of these contentions and therefore deciding the act to be unconstitutional, the court reverses and finally disposes of the case. Although I am unable to concur in the conclusion as to the want of power of Congress and in the judgment of reversal as rendered, I am nevertheless of opinion that there should be a judgment of reversal without prejudice to a new trial because of the grave misapprehension and grievous misapplication of the statute upon which the conviction and sentence below were based. I state the reasons which control me as to both these subjects.\n By an amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act of 1910 Congress, in 1911, dealt with state primaries for the nomination of Senators and Representatives in Congress and with the election after nomination of such candidates (Act of June 25, 1910, c. 392, 36 Stat. 822; Act of August 19, 1911, c. 33,  8, 37 Stat. 25, 28). At that time there existed in the state of Michigan a law regulating state nominating primaries which included candidates for state offices as well as for the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States. These primaries were held in the month of August in each year preceding the November general election. By that law the result of the primaries determined the right to have a person's name placed as a candidate on the ballot at the general election, and in the case of United States Senators \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 260]\n\u00a0\n provision was made for the return of the result of the primary to the state Legislature before the time when the duty of that body to elect a Senator would arise.\n The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution providing for the election of United States Senators by popular vote was promulgated in May, 1913. In June, 1914, Congress by legislation carrying out the amendment provided that thereafter Senators should be elected by popular vote, and, where state laws to that effect existed, made them applicable. But, evidently to give time for the states to enact the necessary legislation substituting for election by the Legislature the method of election established by the amendment, it was provided that where no law for primaries by popular vote as to Senators existed that subject should be controlled by the state law regulating primaries for the nomination of Representative at Large, if provided for, and if not, by the provisions controlling as to primaries for general state officers, the operation of these latter provisions being expressly limited to a term of three years ( Act of June 4, 1914, c. 103, 38 Stat. 384). Within the time thus fixed and before the election which was held of this case, the state of Michigan, in order to conform its laws to the amendment, modified them so as to provide for the election of Senators by popular vote, and made the general nominating state primary law applicable to that condition (Act No. 156, Mich. Acts of 1915), and by virtue of the amendment, the act of Congress, and the state law just stated, the primary with which we are concerned in this case was held in August, 1918.\n The plaintiff in error, Newberry, was a candidate for the nomination of the Republican party as United States Senator and having been nominated at such primary became a candidate at the ensuing November election, and was returned as elected. Subsequently the indictment under which the conviction below was had was \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 261]\n\u00a0\n presented charging him and others in six counts with a conspiracy to commit violations of provisions of the Corrupt Practices Act relating to state nominating primaries as well as to the resulting general election. It is not at this moment necessary to describe the nature of these accusations further, since it is not questioned that the indictment charged a conspiracy to commit crimes within the intendment tendment of the Corrupt Practices Act and hence involved the question of the constitutional power of Congress which the court now adversely decides and the basis for which I now come to consider.\n As the nominating primary was held after the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment, the power must have been sanctioned by that amendment, but for the purpose of clarity I consider the question of the power, first from the provisions of the Constitution as they existed before the amendment, and second in contemplation of the light thrown upon the subject by the force of the amendment.\n The provisions of scetions 2 and 3 of article I of the Constitution fixing the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate and providing for the election of Representatives by vote of the people of the several states and of Senators by the state Legislatures, were undoubtedly reservoirs of vital federal power constituting the generative sources of the provisions of section 4, clause 1, of the same article creating the means for vivifying the bodies previously ordained (Senate and House), that is, providing:\n'The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.'\n\n As without this grant no state power on the subject was possessed, it follows that the state power to create primaries as to United States Senators depended upon \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 262]\n\u00a0\n the grant for its existence. It also follows that as the conferring of the power on the states and the reservation of the authority in Congress to regulate being absolutely coterminous, except as to the place of choosing Senators which is not here relevant, it results that nothing is possible of being done under the former which is not subjected to the limitation imposed by the latter. And this is illustrated by the legislation of Congress and the decisions of this court upholding the same. See 'Act to regulate the times and manner of holding elections for Senators in Congress,' approved July 25, 1866, 14 Stat. 243; Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 144; Act of July 14, 1870, 16 Stat. 254; Act of June 10, 1872, 17 Stat. 347; Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n; Ex parte Clarke, \n100 U.S. 399\n; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 U.S. 651\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 152; United States v. Mosely, \n238 U.S. 383\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 904.\n But it is said that, as the power which is challenged here is the right of a state to provide for and regulate a state primary for nominating United States Senators free from the control of Congress, and not the election of such Senators, therefore as the nominating primary is one thing and the election another and different thing, the power of the state as to the primary is not governed by the right of Congress to regulate the times and manner of electing Senators. But the proposition is a suicidal one, since it at one and the same time retains in the state the only power it could possibly have as delegated by the clause in question and refuses to give effect to the regulating control which the clause confers on Congress as to that very power. And mark, this is emphasized by the consideration that there is no denial here that the States possess the power over the federal subject resulting from the provision of the Constitution, but a holding that Congress may not exert as to such power to regulate authority which the terms of the identical clause of the Constitution confer upon it. \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 263]\n\u00a0\n But, putting these contradictions aside let me test the contention from other and distinct points of view: (1) In last analysis the contention must rest upon the proposition that there is such absolute want of relation between the power of government to regulate the right of the citizen to seek a nomination for a public office and its authority to regulate the election after nomination, that a paramount government authority having the right to regulate the latter is without any power as to the former. The influence of who is nominated for elective office upon the result of the election to fill that office is so known of all men that the proposition may be left to destroy itself by its own statement.\n\n\n (2)\n Moreover the proposition, impliedly at least, excludes from view the fact that the powers conferred upon Congress by the Constitution carry with them the right 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers' (article I,  8, cl. 18), and in doing so virtually disregards the previous legislative history and the decisions of this court sanctioning the same, to which we have referred, since that practice and those decisions unmistakably recognize that the power under the clause in question extends to all the prerequisite and appropriate incidents necessary to the discharge of the authority given.\n\n\n (3)\n From a somewhat different point of view the same result is even more imperatively required. Thus, as has been seen, the election was had under the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, providing for the election of Senators by popular vote instead of by the state legislatures. In the resolution providing for the passage of that amendment through Congress, as first reported by Senator Borah on behalf of the judiciary committee, after making the changes necessary to substitute a provision causing Senators to be elected by popular vote instead of by the legislatures of the several States, the \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 264]\n\u00a0\n provision of section 4 of article I reserving to Congress the power 'to make or alter,' except as to places, the regulations adopted by the several states as to the 'times, places and manner' of electing Senators, was omitted, thus leaving all power on the subject in the States, free from any regulating control of Congress. (S. Rep. 961, 61st Cong. 3d Sess.)\n There was division, however, concerning the matter, manifested by a proposition to amend the resolution, as reported, so as to retain the omitted provision, thus preserving the power of Congress as originally conferred. Cong. Rec. vol. 46, part 1, p. 847. The legislative situation thus created was aptly stated by Senator Borah, referring to the report of the committee and to the proposition (submitted by Senator Sutherland of Utah) to amend that report and the resolution accompanying it. He said:\n'In reference to the amendment which has been suggested by the Senator from Utah (Mr. Sutherland), it was considered at some length before the committee. The proposition is a simple one. As the joint resolution now stands, the times, places and manner of electing United States Senators is left entirely to the state. The state may determine the rules and regulations, and the times, places and manner of holding elections for United States Senators.\n\n'If the amendment as offered by the Senator from Utah should prevail, then the matter would be left as it now is, subject to the supervision and control of Congress.'5\n\n After much consideration the amendment offered by Senator Sutherland was carried. \n6\n But the reported resolution, as thus amended, did not pass during that Congress. In the first session of the following Congress, however, the Sixty-Second Congress, a resolution identical in \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 265]\n\u00a0\n terms with the one which had been reported in the Senate at the previous session was introduced in the House and passed the same. \n7\n In the Senate the House resolution was favorably reported from the committee by Senator Borah,8 accompanied, however, by a minority report by Senator Sutherland,9 offering as a substitute a resolution preserving the complete power of Congress, as had been provided for in the Senate in the previous Congress, and an amendment to the same effect offered by Senator Bristow was subsequently adopted,10 and as thus amended the resolution was ultimately submitted for ratification, and, as we have seen, was ratified and promulgated. 38 Stat. 2049.\n When the plain purpose of the amendment is thus seen, and it is borne in mind that at the time it was pending, the amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act dealing with state primaries for nominating United States Senators which is now before us was in the process of consideration in Congress, and when it is further remembered that after the passage of the amendment, Congress enacted legislation so that the amendment might be applied to state senatorial primaries, there would seem to be an end to all doubt as to the power of Congress.\n It is not disputable that originally instructions to representatives in state Legislatures by party conventions or by other unofficial bodies, as to the persons to be elected as United States Senators were resorted to as a means of indirectly controlling that subject and thus, in a sense, restricting the constitutional provision as to the mode of electing Senators. The potentiality of instructions of that character to accomplish that result is \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 266]\n\u00a0\n amply shown by the development of our constitutional institutions as regards the Electoral College, where it has come to pass that the unofficial nomination of party has rendered the discharge of its duties by the Electoral College a mere matter of form. That in some measure at least a tendency to that result came about under the constitutional direction that Senators should be elected by the people would appear not doubtful. The situation on this subject is illustrated by a statement in a treatise by Haynes on Election of Senators, 1906, p. 132, as follows:\n'Notwithstanding our rigid Constitution's decree that the senators from the several states shall be elected by 'the legislatures thereof,' this act of the Legislatures may be deprived of nearly all of its vitality. The election of President offers an illustration of the filching of actual power away from the electors in whom it is vested by law. When James Russell Lowell, a Republican elector for Massachusetts in 1876, was urged to exercise his independence and vote for Tilden, he declined, saying that, 'whatever the first intent of the Constitution was, usage had made the presidential electors strictly the instruments of the party which chose them.' The Constitution remains unchanged, yet presidential electors recognize that they have been stripped of all discretion. It appears that under certain conditions the election of Senators by state Legislatures has been and can be made an equally perfunctory affair.'\n\n The growth of the tendency to make the indirect result thus stated more effective evidently was the genesis of the statutory primary to nominate Senators. See statement concerning an amendment to the Constitution of Nebraska on that subject as early as 1875, in the same treatise (page 141).\n The large number of states which at this day have by law established senatorial primaries shows the develop ment \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 267]\n\u00a0\n of the movement which originated so long ago under the circumstances just stated. They serve to indicate the tenacity of the conviction that the relation of the primary to the election is to intimate that the influence of the former is largely determinative of the latter. I have appended in the margin a statement from a publication on the subject,11 showing how well founded this conviction is and how it has come to pass that in some cases at least the result of the primary has been in substance to render the subsequent election merely perfunctory. Under these conditions I find it impossible to say that the admitted power of Congress to control and regulate the election of Senators does not embrace, as \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 268]\n\u00a0\n appropriate to that power, the authority to regulate the primary held under state authority.\n\n\n (4)\n It is true that the plenary reservation in Congress of the power to control the states in the exercise of the authority to deal with the times, places, and manner of electing Senators and Representatives, as originally expressed in the Constitution, caused much perturbation in the conventions of the several states which were called upon to consider ratification, resulting from the fear that such power to regulate might be extended to and embrace the regulation of the election of the members of the state Legislatures who were to exercise the power to elect Senators. It is further true that articles in the Federalist and other papers published at the time served to dispel the fear by directing attention to the fact that the regulating power of Congress only extended to the times, places and manner of electing Senators and did not include an authority, even by implication, to deal with the election of the state Legislatures, which was a power reserved to the states. But this only served to emphasize the distinction between the state and federal power and affords no ground at this late day for saying that the reserved state power has absorbed and renders impossible of exercise the authority of Congress to regulate the federal power concerning the election of United States Senators, submitted, to the extent provided, to the authority of the states upon the express condition that such authority should be subordinate to and controlled by congressional regulation.\n Can any other conclusion be upheld except upon the theory that the phantoms of attenuated and unfounded doubts concerning the meaning of the Constitution, which have long perished, may now be revived for the purpose of depriving Congress of the right to exert a power essential to its existence, and this in the face of the fact that the only basis for the doubts which arose in \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 269]\n\u00a0\n the beginning (the election of Senators by the state Legislatures) has been completely removed by the Seventeenth Amendment?\n I do not stop to refer to the state cases concerning the distinction between state legislative power to deal with elections and its authority to control primaries, as I cannot discover the slightest ground upon which they could be apposite, since here an inherent federal right and the provision of the Constitution in dealing with it are the subjects for consideration.\n Moreover, in passing, I observe that as this case concerns a state primary law imposing obligatory results, and the act of Congress dealing with the same, it is obvious that the effect of individual action is wholly beside the issue.\n The consequence to result from a denial to Congress of the right to regulate is so aptly illustrated by the case in hand that in leaving the question I refer to it. Thus, it is stated, and not denied, that in the state primary in question, one of the candidates, as permitted by the state law, propounded himself at the primary election as the candidate for the nomination for Senator of both the Republican and the Democratic parties. If the candidacy had been successful as to both, the subsequent election would have been reduced to the merest form.\n In view, then, of the plain text of the Constitution, of the power exerted under it from the beginning, of the action of Congress in its legislation, and of the amendment to the Constitution, as well as of the legislative action of substantially the larger portion of the states, I can see no reason for now denying the power of Congress to regulate a subject which from its very nature inheres in and is concerned with the election of Senators of the United States, as provided by the Constitution.\n The indictment remains to be considered. It contained six counts. For the moment, it suffices to say that the \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 270]\n\u00a0\n first four all dealt with a common subject, that is, a conspiracy between Newberry and others named to contribute and expend, for the purposes of the state primary and general election, more money than allowed by the Corrupt Practices Act. The fifth count charged a conspiracy on the part of the defendants to commit a great number, to wit, 1,000, offenses against the United States, each to consist of giving money and things of value to a person to vote for Newberry at said election, and a great number, to wit, 1,000, other offenses against the United States, each to consist of giving money and things of value to a person to withhold his vote from Henry Ford at said general election. The sixth count charged a conspiracy to defraud by use of the mails.\n At the trial before the submission of the case to the jury, the court put the fifth count entirely out of the case by instructing the jury to disregard it, as there was no evidence whatever to sustain it. The bribery charge, therefore, disappeared. The second, third and fourth counts, dealing, as I have said, with one general subject, were found by the court to be all in substance countained in the first count. They were therefore, by direction of the court, either eliminated or consolidated with the first count. Thus, as contained in that count the matters charged in the first four counts were submitted to the jury, as was also the sixth count; but the latter we need not further consider, as upon it there was a verdict of not guilty.\n The case therefore reduces itself solely to the matters covered in the first count. That count charged a conspiracy on the part of the defendants, 135 in number, including Newberry, to commit an offense against the United States, that is, the offense on the part of Newberry of violating the Corrupt Practices Act by giving, contributing, expending and using and by causing to be given, contributed, expended and used, in procuring \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 271]\n\u00a0\n his nomination and election as such Senator at said primary and general elections, a sum in excess of the amount which he might lawfully give, contribute, expend or use, and cause to be given, contributed, expended or used for such purpose under the laws of Michigan, and in excess of $10,000, to wit, the sum of $100,000; and on the part of the other defendants of aiding, counseling, inducing, and procuring Newberry as such candidate to give, contribute, expend and use, or cause to be given, contributed, expended or used said large and excessive sum, in order to procure his nomination and election.\n Conspiracy to contribute and expend in excess of the amount permitted by the statute was, then, the sole issue, wholly disassociated from and disconnected with any corrupt or wrongful use of the amount charged to have been illegally contributed and expended. As putting out of view the constitutional question already considered, the errors assigned are based solely upon asserted misconstructions of the statute by the court in its charge to the jury, we bring the statute at once into view. It provides, so far as relevant to the case before us:\n'No candidate for ... Senator of the United States shall give, contribute, expend, use, or promise, or cause to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised, in procuring his nomination and election, any sum, in the aggregate, in excess of the amount which he may lawfully give, contribute, expend, or promise under the laws of the state in which he resides: Provided, that ... no candidate for United States Senator shall give, contribute, expend, use, or promise any sum, in the aggregate, exceeding ten thousand dollars in any campaign for his nomination and election. ...'\n\n Coming to deal with the statute, the court, after pointing out in the most explicit terms that the limitation on the amount which might be lawfully contributed and expended or caused to be contributed and expended in \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 272]\n\u00a0\n the case at hand was $3,750 (that being the limitation imposed by the laws of Michigan adopted by the statute of the United States just quoted), then proceeded, over objections duly reserved, to instruct as to the significance of the statute, involved in the prohibitions (a) against giving, contributing, expending, or using, and (b) against causing to be given, contributed, expended, or used, money in excess of that permitted by the statute, saying on these subjects as follows:\n\n\n (a)\n 'It is important, therefore, that you should understand the meaning of the language employed in this Corrupt Practices Act, and that you should understand and comprehend the effect and scope of the act, and the meaning of the language there employed, and the effect and scope and extent of the prohibition against the expenditure and use of money therein contained.\n'The words 'give, contribute, expend or use,' as employed in this statute have their usual and ordinary significance, and mean furnish, pay out, disburse, employ, or make use of. The term 'to cause to be expended, or used,' as it is employed in this statute, means to occasion, to effect, to bring about, to produce the expenditure and use of the money.\n\n'The prohibition contained in this statute against the expenditure and use of money by the candidate is not limited or confined to the expenditure and use of his own money. The prohibition is directed against the use and expenditure of excessive sums of money by the candidate from whatever source or from whomsoever those moneys may be derived.'\n\n\n (b)\n 'The phrase which constitutes the prohibition against the candidate 'causing to be given, contributed, expended or used excessive sums of money,' is not limited and not confined to expenditures and use of money made directly and personally by himself. This prohibition extends to the expenditure and use of excessive sums of \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 273]\n\u00a0\n money in which the candidate actively participates, or assists, or advises, or directs, or induces, or procures. The prohibition extends not only to the expenditure and use of excessive sums of money by the candidate directly and personally, but to such use and expenditure through his agency, or procurement or assistance.\n'To constitute a violation of this statute knowledge of the expenditure and use of excessive sums of money on the part of the candidate is not sufficient; neither is it sufficient to constitute a violation of this statute that the candidate merely acquiesces in such expenditures and use. But it is sufficient to constitute a violation of this statute if the candidate actively participates in doing the things which occasion such expenditures and use of money and so actively participates with knowledge that the money is being expended and used.'\n\n Having thus fixed the meaning of the prohibitions of the statute, the court came to apply them as thus defined to the particular case before it, saying:\n\n\n (c)\n 'To apply these rules to this case: If you are satisfied from the evidence that the defendant, Truman H. Newberry at or about the time that he became a candidate for United States Senator was informed and knew that his campaign for the nomination and election would require the expenditure and use of more money than is permitted by law and with such knowledge became a candidate, and thereafter by advice, by conduct, by his acts, by his direction, by his counsel, or by his procurement he actively participated and took part in the expenditure and use of an excessive sum of money, of an unlawful sum of money, you will be warranted in finding that he did violate this statute known as the Corrupt Practices Act.'\n Whether the instructions marked (a) and (b), if unexplained, were, in view of the ambiguity lurking in many of the expressions used therein, prejudicially \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 274]\n\u00a0\n erroneous, I do not think necessary to consider, since I see no escape from the conclusion that the instruction marked (c), which made application of the view of the statute stated in the previous passages (a) and (b), were in clear conflict with the text of the statute and were necessarily of a seriously prejudicial nature, since in substance they announced the doctrine that, under the statute, although a candidate for the office of Senator might not have contributed a cent to the campaign or caused others to do so, he nevertheless was guilty if he became a candidate or continued as such ater acquiring knowlege that more than $3, 750 had been contributed and was being expended in the campaign. The error in the instruction plainly resulted from a failure to distinguish between the subject with which the statute dealt-contributions and expenditures made or caused to be made by the candidate-and campaign contributions and expenditures penditures not so made or caused to be made, and therefore not within the statute.\n There can be no doubt when the limitations as to expenditure which the statute imposed are considered in the light of its context and its genesis, that its prohibitions on that subject were intended, not to restrict the right of the citizen to contribute to a campaign, but to prohibit the candidate from contributing and expending or causing to be contributed and expended, to secure his nomination and election a larger amount than the sum limited as provided in the statute. To treat the candidacy, as did the charge of the court, as being necessarily the cause, without more, of the contribution of the citizen to the campaign, was therefore to confound things which were wholly different, to the frustration of the very object and purpose of the statute. To illustrate: Under the instruction given, in every case where to the knowledge of the candidate a sum in excess of the amount limited by the statute was contributed by citizens to the \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 275]\n\u00a0\n campaign, the candidate, if he failed to withdraw, would be subject to criminal prosecution and punishment. So also, contributions by citizens to the expenses of the campaign, if only knowledge could be brought home to them that the aggregate of such contributions would exceed the limit of the statute, would bring them, as illustrated by this case, within the conspiracy statute and accordingly subject to prosecution. Under this view the greater the public service, and the higher the character, of the candidate, giving rise to a correspondingly complete and self-sacrificing support by the electorate to his candidacy, the more inevitably would criminality and infamous punishment result both to the candidate and to the citizen who contributed.\n As it follows from the considerations which I have stated that the judgment below was, in my opinion, clearly wrong and therefore should be reversed, it is not necessary that I should go further and point out how cogently under the case presented the illustrations just previously made apply to it. For the reasons stated, although I dissent from the ruling of the court as to the unconstitutionality of the act of Congress, I nevertheless think its judgment of reversal should be adopted, qualified, however, so as to reserve the right to a new trial.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, concurring in part.\n I concur in the judgment reversing the conviction of plaintiffs in error, but upon grounds fundamentally different from those adopted by the majority: my view being that there is no constitutional infirmity in the act of Congress that underlies the indictment, but that there was an error in the submission of the case to the jury that calls for a new trial.\n The constitutional question is so important that it deserves treatment at length. \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 276]\n\u00a0\n The federal Corrupt Practices Act (Act of June 25, 1910, c. 392, 36 Stat. 822, amended by Act of August 19, 1911, c. 33, 37 Stat. 25, 28) limits the amount of money that may be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised, or caused to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised by a candidate for Representative in Congress or for Senator of the United States in procuring his nomination and election, to a sum not in excess of the amount he may lawfully give, contribute, expend, or promise under the laws of the state of his residence, with a proviso that in the case of a candidate for Representative the amount shall not exceed $ 5,000, and in the case of a candidate for Senator shall not exceed $10,000, in any campaign for nomination and election; and a further proviso that any assessment, fee, or charge made or levied upon candidates by the laws of the state, or moneys expended for the candidate's necessary personal expenses for travel and subsistence, stationery and postage, writing or printing (other than in newspapers), and distributing letters, circulars, and posters, and for telegraph and telephone service, shall not be regarded as an expenditure or considered as a part of the sum fixed as the limit of expense. Section 10 of the act (36 Stat. 824), renumbered as section 11 by the amendment (37 Stat. 26; Comp. St.  198), prescribes fine or imprisonment for a willful violation of any of its provisions. The act and amendment were passed before the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment, providing for the election of Senators by direct vote of the people (declared adopted May 31, 1913-38 Stat. 2049); but it is clear- indeed undisputed -that, for present purposes, they are to receive the same construction and effect as if enacted after adoption of the amendment.\n The present case arose out of a campaign for nomination and election of a Senator in the state of Michigan, where a statute (Act No. 109,  1, Mich, Pub. Acts 1913) limits the amount of money that may be paid, and of \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 277]\n\u00a0\n expenses that may be authorized or incurred by or on behalf of any candidate to be paid by him in order to secure his nomination to any public office in the state, to 25 per centum of one year's salary of the office, and imposes a similar limit upon expenditures by or on behalf of any candidate who has received the nomination. By section 19 of the same statute 'public office' is made to apply to any national office filled by the voters of the state, as well as to the office of presidential elector and United States Senator. The acts of Congress, in connection with the statute of the state, limit the amount that a candidate for Senator of the United States may give, contribute, expend, use, or promise, or cause to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised, in procuring his nomination and election, to $3,750 in the aggregate, aside from those expenditures that are specifically permitted without limit.\n Plaintiffs in error were indicted and convicted in the United States District Court for a conspiracy (section 37, Criminal Code) to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, the offense, on the part of Truman H. Newberry, of willfully violating the acts of Congress above referred to by giving, contributing, expending, and using, and by causing to be given, contributed, expended, and used, in procuring his nomination and election as Senator of the United States at the primary and general elections in the year 1918, a sum in excess of the amount thus limited, to wit, the sum of $100,000, and on the part of the other defendants of aiding, counseling, inducing, and procuring (section 332, Criminal Code; Comp. St.  10506) said Truman H. Newberry so to give, contribute, expend, and use, and cause to be given, contributed, expended, and used said large sums of money in excess of the amounts permitted, etc.; no part of which money was to be expended for any of the purposes specifically permitted without limit; numerous overt acts being alleged to have been done by one \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 278]\n\u00a0\n or more parties defendant to effect the object of the conspiracy.\n The averments of the indictment and the evidence at the trial related especially to expenditures contemplated to be made, and in fact made, to bring about Mr. Newberry's selection at a nominating or primary election held in August, 1918, with only minor expenditures made after that date and in contemplation of the general election which was held in the following November. The case is brought to this court by direct writ of error, upon the fundamental contention that the acts of Congress, in so far as they assume to regulate primary elections and limit the expenditures of money that may be made or caused to be made by a candidate therein, are in excess of the power conferred upon Congress to regulate the 'manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives' by section 4 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. This question was raised, but not decided, in United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 487\n, 488 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 407; Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 278\n, 279 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 495.\n For reasons to be stated below, I consider is erroneous to treat the question as dependent upon the words of the cited section alone. I will, however, first deal with that section, viewing it in connection with other provisions immediately associated with it and here quoted:\n'Article I. Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n'Section 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. ...' \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 279]\n\u00a0\n (Section 3 is superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, which provides:)\n\n'Article XVII. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, ... The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures . ...'\n\n'Section 4. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. ...\n\n'Section 5. Each House shall be the Judge\n\n'Section 5. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members. ...'\n\n It is contended that Congress has no power to regulate the amount of money that may be expended by a candidate to secure his being named in the primary election; that the power 'to regulate the manner of holding elections,' etc., relates solely to the general elections where Senators or Representatives are finally chosen. Why should 'the manner of holding elections' be so narrowly construed? An election is the choosing of a person by vote to fill a public office. In the nature of things it is a complex process, involving some examination of the qualifications of those from whom the choice is to be made and of those by whom it is to be made; some opportunity for the electors to consider and canvass the claims of the eligibles; and some method of narrowing the choice by eliminating candidates until one finally secures a majority, or at least a plurality, of the votes. For the process of elimination, instead of tentative elections participated in by all the electors, nominations by parties or groups of citizens have obtained in the United States from an early period. Latterly the processes of nomina tion \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 280]\n\u00a0\n have been regulated by law in many of the states, through the establishment of official primary elections. But in the essential sense, a sense that fairly comports with the object and purpose of a Constitution such as ours, which deals in broad outline with matters of substance and is remarkable for succinct and pithy modes of expression, all of the various processes above indicated fall fairly within the definition of 'the manner of holding elections.' This is not giving to the word 'elections' a significance different from that which it bore when the Constitution was adopted, but is simply recognizing a content that of necessity always inhered in it. The nature of that instrument required, as Chief Justice Marshall pointed out in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (4 L. Ed. 579):\n'That only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves.'\n\n It is said that section 4 of article I does not confer a general power to regulate elections, but only to regulate 'the manner of holding' them. But this can mean nothing less than the entire mode of procedure-the essence, not merely the form, of conducting the elections. The only specific grant of power over the subject contained in the Constitution is contained in that section; and the power is conferred primarily upon the Legislatures of the several states, but subject to revision and modification by Congress. If the preliminary processes of such an election are to be treated as something so separate from the final choice that they are not within the power of Congress under this provision, they are for the same reason not with within the power of the states, and, if there is no other grant of power, they must perforce remain wholly unregulated. For if this section of the Constitution is to be strictly construed with respect to the power granted to Congress thereunder, it must be construed with equal \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 281]\n\u00a0\n strictness with respect to the power conferred upon the states; if the authority to regulate the 'manner of holding elections' does not carry with it exvi termini authority to regulate the preliminary election held for the purpose of proposing candidates, then the states can no more exercise authority over this than Congress can; much less an authority exclusive of that of Congress. For the election of Senators and Representatives in Congress is a federal function; whatever the states do in the matter they do under authority derived from the Constitution of the United States. The reservation contained in the Tenth Amendment cannot properly operate upon this subject in favor of the state governments; they could not reserve power over a matter that had no previous existence; hence if the power was not delegated to the United States it must be deemed to have been reserved to the people, and would require a constitutional amendment to bring it into play-a deplorable result of strict construction.\n But if I am wrong in this, and the power to regulate primary elections could be deemed to have been reserved by the states to the exclusion of Congress, the result would be to leave the general government destitute of the means to insure its own preservation without governmental aid from the states, which they might either grant or withhold according to their own will. This would render the government of the United States something less than supreme in the exercise of its own appropriate powers; a doctrine supposed to have been laid at rest forever by the decisions of this court in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 et seq., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 381, 387, 414; and many other decisions in the time of Chief Justice Marshall and since.\n But why should the primary election (or nominating convention) and the final election be treated as things so separate and apart as not to be both included in section 4 of \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 282]\n\u00a0\n article I? The former has no reason for existence, no function to perform, except as a preparation for the latter; and the latter has been found by experience in many states impossible of orderly and successful accomplishment without the former.\n Why should this provision of the Constitution-so vital to the very structure of the government-be so narrowly construed? It is said primaries were unknown when the Constitution was adopted. So were the steam railway and the electric telegraph. But the authority of Congress to regulate commerce among the several states was extended over these instrumentalities, because it was recognized that the manner of conducting the commerce was not essential. And this court was prompt to recognize that a transportation of merchandise, incidentally interrupted for a temporary purpose, or proceeding under successive bills of lading or means of transport, some operating wholly intrastate, was none the less interstate commerce, if such commerce was the practical and essential result of all that was done. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 565; Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm., \n219 \nU.S. 498, 526\n, 527 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 288; Ohio R. R. Comm. v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 108\n, 110 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 635; United States v. Union Stock Yard, \n226 \nU.S. 286, 304\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 83; Texas & N. O. R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111, 124\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 229.\n Why is it more difficult to recognize the integral relation of the several steps in the process of election?\n Congress, by the so-called Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870 (chapter 114,  20, 16 Stat. 140, 145), and the supplement approved February 28, 1871 (chapter 99,  1, 2, 3, 4, 16 Stat. 433, 434), prescribed a variety of regulations relating to elections of members of the House of Representatives, including provisions for safeguarding the registration of voters. These were carried into the Revised Statutes as sections 2011, 2016, 2021, 2022, 5522. They were attacked \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 283]\n\u00a0\n as unconstitutional in Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n, and were sustained as an exertion of the authority of Congress to pass laws for regulating and superintending such elections and for securing their purity-without suggestion that the registration of voters was not, for practical purposes, a part of the election itself and subject to regulation as such. Yet, in point of causation, identification of voters is related to the election no more closely than is the naming of candidates.\n It is said that if 'the manner of holding elections' had been understood in a sense to include the nominating procedure, ratification of the Constitution by the state conventions could not have been secured. I do not see how this can be confidently asserted, in view of the fact that, by the very hypothesis, the conventions ratified a specific provision for regulating the only manner of holding elections with which they were familiar-dealt with the entire subject without limitation. Mr. Justice Story, in rehearsing the objections, and the reasoning by which they were met, with citations from the debates and from the Federalist, refers to no objection that would be more cogent, supposing the regulation were extended to nominating procedure, than it would be if the regulation were confined to the ultimate election. Story, Const.,  814-827. The sufficient answer to all objections was found in Hamilton's 'plain proposition, that every government ought to contain in itself the means of its own preservation.' Federalist, No. 89.\n What was said, in No. 60 of the Federalist, about the authority of the national government being restricted to the regulation of the times, the places, and the manner of elections, was in answer to a criticism that the national power over the subject 'might be employed in such a manner as to promote the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others,' as by discriminating 'between the different departments of industry, or between \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 284]\n\u00a0\n the different kinds of property, or between the different degrees of property,' or by a leaning 'in favor of the landed interest, or the moneyed interest, or the mercantile interest, or the manufacturing interest,' and it was to support his contention that there was 'no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended, but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect, or be elected,' which formed no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government, that Hamilton proceeded to say that its authority would be 'expressly restricted to the regulation of the times, the places, and the manner of elections.' This authority would be as much restricted, in the sense there intended, if 'the manner of elections' were construed to include all the processes of election from first to last. The restriction arose from the express qualifications prescribed for members of House and Senate, and for those who were to choose them, subject to which all regulation of preliminary, as well as of final, steps in the election necessarily would have to proceed.\n In support of a narrow construction of the power of Congress to regulate 'the manner of elections' of its membership, it is said there is a check against corruption and kindred evils affecting the nominating procedure, in the authority of each house to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members; the suggestion being that if-to take a clear case-it appeared that one chosen to the Senate had secured his election through bribery and corruption at the nominating primary, he might be refused admittance. Obviously, this amounts to a concession that the primary and the definitive election, whose legal separateness is insisted upon, are essentially but parts of a single process; else how could the conduct of a candidate with reference to the primary have legitimate bearing upon the question of his election as Senator? But the suggestion involves a fundamental \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 285]\n\u00a0\n error of reasoning. The power to judge of the elections and qualifications of its members, inhering in each House by virtue of section 5 of article I, is an important power, essential in our system to the proper organization of an elective body of representatives. But it is a power to judge, to determine upon reasonable consideration of pertinent matters of fact according to established principles and rules of law; not to pass an arbitrary edict of exclusion. And I am unable to see how, in right reason, it can be held that one of the houses of Congress, in the just exercise of its power, may exclude an elected member for securing by bribery his nomination at the primary, if the regulation by law of his conduct at the primary is beyond the constitutional power of Congress itself. Moreover, the power of each house, even if it might rightfully be applied to exclude a member in the case suggested, is not an adequate check upon bribery, corruption, and other irregularities in the primary elections. It can impose no penal consequences upon the offender; when affirmatively exercised it leaves the constituency for the time without proper representation; it may exclude one improperly elected, but furnishes no rule for the future by which the selection of a fit representative may be assured; and it is exerted at the will of but a single house, not by Congress as a law-making body.\n But if I am wrong thus far-if the word 'elections' in article I, section 4, of the Constitution must be narrowly confined to the single and definitive step described as an election at the time that instrument was adopted-nevertheless it seems to me too clear for discussion that primary elections and nominating conventions are so closely related to the final election, and their proper regulation so essential to effective regulation of the latter, so vital to representative government, that power to regulate them is within the general authority of Congress. It is matter of common knowledge that the great mass of \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 286]\n\u00a0\n the American electorate is grouped into political parties, to one or the other of which voters adhere with tenacity, due to their divergent views on questions of public policy, their interest, their environment, and various other influences, sentimental and historical. So strong with the great majority of voters are party associations, so potent the party slogan, so effective the party organization, that the likelihood of a candidate succeeding in an election without a party nomination is practically negligible. As a result, every voter comes to the polls on the day of the general election confined in his choice to those few candidates who have received party nominations, and constrained to consider their eligibility, in point of personal fitness, as affected by their party associations and their obligation to pursue more or less definite lines of policy, with which the voter may or may not agree. As a practical matter, the ultimate choice of the mass of voters is predetermined when the nominations have been made. Hence, the authority of Congress to regulate the primary elections and nominating conventions arises, of necessity, not from any indefinite or implied grant of power, but from one clearly expressed in the Constitution itself (article I,  8, cl. 18):\n'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'\n\n This is the power preservative of all others, and essential for adding vitality to the framework of the government. Among the primary powers to be carried into effect is the power to legislate through a Congress consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives chosen by the people-in short, the power to maintain a law-making body representative in its character. Another is the specific power to regulate the 'manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives,' conferred by section 4 of the first article; and if this does not in \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 287]\n\u00a0\n literal terms extend to nominating proceedings intimately related to the election itself, it certainly does not in terms or by implication exclude federal control of those proceedings. From a grant to the states of power to regulate the principal matter, expressly made subject to revision and alteration by the Congress, it is impossible to imply a grant to the states of regulatory authority over accessory matters exclusive of the Congress. And it is obvious that if clause 18 adds nothing to the content of the other express powers, when these are literally interpreted, it has no efficacy whatever and must be treated as surplusage. It has not, heretofore, been so regarded. The subject was exhaustively treated by Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court in the great case already referred to, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 411-424, where he pointed out, pp. 419, 420 (4 L. Ed. 579):\n'1st. The clause is placed among the powers of Congress, not among the limitations on those powers. 2d. Its terms purport to enlarge, not to diminish the powers vested in the government. It purports to be an additional power, not a restriction on those already granted.'\n\n According to the conclusive reasoning adopted in that case, whatever meaning may be attributed to section 4 of article I, there is added by clause 18 of section 8 everything necessary or proper for carrying it into execution-which means, into practical and complete effect.\n The passage of the act under consideration amounts to a determination by the lawmaking body that the regulation of primary elections and nominating conventions is necessary if the Senate and House of Representatives are to be, in a full and proper sense, representative of the people. Not only is this true of those cases referred to in the report of the Senate Committee (Senate Rept. No. 78, 62d Cong. 1st Sess. p. 2), where the parties are so unequally divided that a nomination by the majority party is equivalent to election; but it is true in every case \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 288]\n\u00a0\n to the extent that the nominating processes virtually eliminate from consideration by the electors all eligible candidates except the few-two or three, perhaps-who succeed in receiving party nominations. Sinister influences exerted upon the primaries inevitably have their effect upon the ultimate election-are employed for no other reason. To safeguard the final elections while leaving the proceedings for proposing candidates unregulated, is to postpone regulation until it is comparatively futile. And Congress might well conclude that, if the nominating procedure were to be left open to fraud, bribery, and corruption, or subject to the more insidious, but (in the opinion of Congress) nevertheless harmful, influences resulting from an unlimited expenditure of money in paid propaganda and other purchased campaign activities, representative government would be endangered.\n The question of the authority of Congress to determine that laws regulating primary elections are 'necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the other powers specified, admits of but one answer-the same given by Chief Justice Marshall in the memorable case last cited (4 Wheat. 421):\n'We think the sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national Legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.'\n\n This principle has been consistently adhered to and liberally applied from that day until this. Among a multitude of illustrative cases that might be cited, some \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 289]\n\u00a0\n recent notable, but not exceptional, ones may be instanced: Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44, holding that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states brings within its authority the relations between common carriers by rail and their employees engaged in such commerce; Houston & Texas Ry. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 350\n, 355 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 833, holding that the same power authorizes Congress to regulate rates of transportation in the internal commerce of a state, to the extent of preventing injurious discrimination against the movement of traffic from state to state; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 353\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024, holding that the power over interstate commerce extends to regulating the wages of the employees of common carriers engaged therein; Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 377, et seq., 38 Sup. Ct. 159, L. R. A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856, sustaining an act imposing involuntary military duty upon the citizen as 'necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the power to declare war, raise and support armies, and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 445, upholding the authority of Congress to prohibit and punish the fraudulent making of spurious interstate bills of lading even in the absence of any actual or contemplated movement of commerce from state to state; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 155\n, 163 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 106, sustaining war-time prohibition of the sale of distilled spirits for beverage purposes as a measure necessary and proper for carrying into execution the war power; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 282\n, 299 S.-301, 40 Sup. Ct. 141, sustaining an act prohibiting the manufacture and sale of nonintoxicating beer as 'necessary and proper' to render effective a prohibition against intoxicants; First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 \nU.S. 416, 419\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169, sustaining an act conferring upon national banks powers not inherently federal, but deemed appropriate to enable such banks to compete with state banks having \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 290]\n\u00a0\n like powers; and Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 U.S. 180\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 243 (decided February 28, last), sustaining an act establishing federal land banks and joint stock land banks having broad powers, not national in their character, but deemed by Congress to be reasonably appropriate for performing certain limited fiscal functions in aid of the national treasury.\n It would be tragic if that provision of the Constitution which has proved the sure defense of every outpost of national power should fail to safeguard the very foundation of the citadel.\n But its function in preserving our representative government has long been recognized. In Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 657\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 152 ( 28 L. Ed. 274), where the question was as to the constitutionality of sections 5508 and 5520, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St.  10183)-the question having arisen upon an indictment for a conspiracy to intimidate a citizen of African descent in the exercise of his right to vote for a member of Congress-the court, by Mr. Justice Miller, said:\n'That a government whose essential character is republican, whose executive head and legislative body are both elective, whose most numerous and powerful branch of the Legislature is elected by the people directly [now true of both branches], has no power by appropriate laws to secure this election from the influence of violence, of corruption, and of fraud, is a proposition so startling as to arrest attention and demand the gravest consideration. If this government is anything more than a mere aggregation of delegated agents of other states and governments, each of which is superior to the general government, it must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from violence and corruption. If it has not this power it is left helpless before the two great natural and historical enemies of all republics, open violence and insidious corruption. The proposition that it has no such power is supported by the old argument, often heard, often repeated, and in this court never assented to, that \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 291]\n\u00a0\n when a question of the power of Congress arises the advocate of the power must be able to place his finger on words which expressly grant it. ... It destroys at one blow, in construing the Constitution of the United States, the doctrine universally applied to all instruments of writing, that what is implied is as much a part of the instrument as what is expressed. This principle, in its application to the Constitution of the United States, more than to almost any other writing, is a necessity, by reason of the inherent inability to put into words all derivative powers-a difficulty which the instrument itself recognizes by conferring on Congress the authority to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution the powers expressly granted and all other powers vested in the government or any branch of it by the Constitution. Article I,  8, cl. 18.'\n\n I conclude that it is free from doubt that the Congress has power under the Constitution to regulate the conduct of primary elections and nominating conventions held for choosing candidates to be voted for in general elections for Representatives and Senators in Congress, and that the provisions of the Act of August 19, 1911 (37 Stat. 26-28), in that behalf are valid.\n Since the majority of the court hold that the act is invalid, it would serve no useful purpose to spend time in discussing those assignments of error that relate to the conduct of the trial. It may be said, however, that, in my opinion, the trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendants for want of evidence of the alleged conspiracy; nor in instructing the jury that the prohibition of the statute against the expenditure and use of money by a candidate beyond the specified limit is not confined to his own money, but extends to the expenditure or use of excessive sums of money by him, from whatever source and from whomsoever derived; nor in instructing them that in order to warrant a ver dict \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 292]\n\u00a0\n of guilty upon an indictment for conspiracy it was not necessary that the government should show that defendants knew that some statute forbade the acts they were contemplating, but only to show an agreement to do acts constituting a violation of the statute; their knowledge of the law being presumed.\n I find prejudicial error, however, in that part of the charge which assumed to define the extent to which a candidate must participate in expenditures beyond the amount limited in order that he may be held to have violated the prohibition-an instruction vitally important because it was largely upon overt acts supposed to have been done in carrying out the alleged conspiracy that the government relied to prove the making of the conspiracy and its character, and because, unless the purposes of defendants involved a violation of the Corrupt Practices Act, they were not guilty of a conspiracy to commit an 'offense against the United States,' within the meaning of section 37, Criminal Code.\n The instruction upon this topic, excepted to and assigned for error, was as follows:\n'The phrase which constitutes the prohibition against the candidate 'causing to be given, contributed, expended or used' excessive sums of money, is not limited and not confined to expenditures and use of money made directly and personally by himself. This prohibition extends to the expenditure and use of excessive sums of money in which the candidate actively participates, or assists, or advises, or directs, or induces, or procures. The prohibition extends not only to the expenditure and use of excessive sums of money by the candidate directly and personally, but to such use and expenditure through his agency, or procurement, or assistance. To constitute a violation of this statute knowledge of the expenditure and use of excessive sums of money on the part of the candidate is not sufficient; neither is it sufficient to constitute a violation of this \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 293]\n\u00a0\n statute that the candidate merely acquiesces in such expenditures and use. But it is sufficient to constitute a violation of this statute if the candidate actively participates in doing the things which occasion such expenditures and use of money and so actively participates with knowledge that the money is being expended and used. To apply these rules to this case: If you are satisfied from the evidence that the defendant, Truman H. Newberry, at or about the time that he became a candidate for United States Senator was informed and knew that his campaign for the nomination and election would require the expenditure and use of more money than is permitted by law and with such knowledge became a candidate, and thereafter by advice, by conduct, by his acts, by his direction, by his counsel, or by his procurement he actively participated and took part in the expenditure and use of an excessive sum of money, of an unlawful sum of money, you will be warranted in finding that he did violate this statute known as the Corrupt Practices Act.'\n\n However this may be regarded when considered in the abstract, the difficulty with it, when viewed in connection with the evidence in the case to which the jury was called upon to apply it, is that it permitted and perhaps encouraged the jury to find the defendants guilty of a conspiracy to violate the Corrupt Practices Act, if they merely contemplated a campaign requiring the expenditure of money beyond the statutory limit, even though Mr. Newberry, the candidate, had not, and it was not contemplated that he should have, any part in causing or procuring such expenditure beyond his mere standing voluntarily as a candidate and participating in the campaign with knowledge that moneys contributed and expended by others without his participation were to be expended.\n The language of the Corrupt Practices Act (37 Stat. 28) is:\n'No candidate ... shall give, contribute, ex pend, \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 294]\n\u00a0\n use, or promise, or cause to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised,' etc.\n\n A reading of the entire act makes it plain that Congress did not intend to limit spontaneous contributions of money by others than a candidate, nor expenditures of such money except as he should participate therein. Of course, it does not mean that he must be alone in expending or causing to be expended the excessive sums of money; if he does it through an agent or agents, or through associates who stand in the position of agents, no doubt he is guilty; qui facit per alium facit per se; but unless he is an offender as a principal there is no offense. Section 332, Criminal Code, declares:\n'Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is a principal.'\n\n Clearly this makes any one who abets a candidate in expending or causing to be expended excessive sums a principal offender; but it cannot change the definition of the offense itself as contained in the Corrupt Practices Act, so as to make a candidate a principal offender unless he directly commits the offense denounced. Spontaneous expenditures by others being without the scope of the prohibition, neither he nor anybody else can be held criminally responsible for merely abetting such expenditures.\n It follows that one's entry upon a candidacy for nomination and election as a Senator with knowledge that such candidacy will come to naught unless supported by expenditure of money beyond the specified limit, is not within the inhibition of the act unless it is contemplated that the candidate shall have a part in procuring the excessive expenditures beyond the effect of his mere candidacy in evoking spontaneous contributions and expenditures by his supporters; and that his remaining in the field and participating in the ordinary activities of the campaign with knowledge that such activities furnish in \n\n[256 U.S. 232, 295]\n\u00a0\n a general sense the 'occasion' for the expenditure is not to be regarded as a 'causing' by the candidate of such expenditure within the meaning of the statute.\n The state of the evidence made it important that, in connection with that portion of the charge above quoted, the jury should be cautioned that unless it was a part of defendants' plan that Mr. Newberry should actually participate in giving, contributing, expending, using, or promising, or causing to be given, contributed, expended, used, or promised moneys in excess of the limited amount-either himself or through others as his agents-his mere participation in the activities of the campaign, even with knowledge that moneys spontaneously contributed and expended by others, without his agency, procurement, or assistance, were to be or were being expended, would not of itself amount to his causing such excessive expenditure. The effect of the instruction that was given may well have been to convey to the jury the view that Mr. Newberry's conduct in becoming and remaining a candidate with knowledge that spontaneous contributions and expenditures of money by his supporters would exceed the statutory limit, and his active participation in the campaign were necessarily equivalent to an active participation by him in causing the expenditure and use of an excessive sum of money, and that a combination among defendants having for its object Mr. Newberry's participation in a campaign where money in excess of the prescribed limit was to be expended, even without his participation in the contribution or expenditure of such money, amounted to a conspiracy on their part to commit an offense against the act.\n For error in the instructions in this particular the judgment should be reversed, with directions for a new trial.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act 109, Michigan Legislature, 1913:\n'Section I. No sums of money shall be paid, and no expenses authorized or incurred by or on behalf of any candidate to be paid by him in order to secure or aid in securing his nomination to any public office or position in this state, in excess of twenty-five per cent. of one year's compensation or salary of the office for which he is candidate: Provided, that a sum not exceeding fifty per cent. of one year's salary may be expended by the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor; or where the office is that of member of either branch of the Legislature of the state, the twenty-five per cent. shall be computed on the salary fixed for the term of two years: Provided further, that no candidate shall be restricted to less than one hundred dollars in his campaign for such nomination.

In the Southern states, victory in such a primary, on the Democratic side, is practically the equivalent of an election, as there is but one effective party in that section of the country. The direct nomination of senators is generally accomplished under voluntary party regulations, as in Alabama, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Virginia. In other cases, however, this method of choice has been placed under legal protection, as in Florida (1901), Mississippi (1902), Louisiana (1906), and Texas (1907). Some Northern states have also adopted this method of direct nomination. Among Northern states, Wisconsin led the way in 1903, followed by Oregon in 1904, Montana in 1905, Iowa, Washington, Nebraska, North Dakota in 1907, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Ohio, and Oklahoma in 1908. ... In some of the states, as in Oregon, candidates for the Legislature are afforded an opportunity to pledge themselves to vote for the party candidate receiving the highest vote in the regular election.

U S(1921)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 5, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. E. Russell, of New York City, and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Claimant brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover compensation as inspector of customs at the port of Baltimore from February 20, 1913, to May 20, 1916, in the sum of $4,740, being at the rate of $4 per day for the period covered. He alleged that he was summarily removed from the service of the United States without charges of any kind being preferred against him, and without an opportunity to be heard, in violation of section 6 of an Act of Congress approved August 24, 1912, 37 Stats. 555 ( Comp. St.  3287). He afterwards amended his petition, so as to claim $4 per day to the day of rendering judgment, September 30, 1917, being the sum of $6,732. The Court of Claims rendered judgment for the United States. 53 Ct. Cl. 463.\n The Court of Claims made a finding of fact from which it appears that Nicholas was appointed an inspector of customs at the port of Baltimore on January 28, 1902, at a compensation of $4 per day; that he continued to discharge the duties of such inspectorship until February 20, 1913, when he was summarily discharged by the collector of customs at the port of Baltimore pursuant to instructions issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; that he was in the classified civil service of the United States; that charges had been preferred against him by a committee appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to examine into and report the conduct of the customs business at Baltimore; that Nicholas had no notice of the charges, was not furnished with a copy thereof, nor was he allowed \n\n[257 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n a reasonable time to personally answer the same in writing. The court further found that there was no evidence of the willingness and ability of the claimant to perform the duties of the office of inspector of customs from the date of his removal on February 20, 1913; that it did not appear that he made any report in person, or writing, to the office of the collector at Baltimore. As a conclusion of law the court found the claimant not entitled to recover.\n An appeal was taken to this court from the judgment of the Court of Claims. Upon motion the Court of Claims was directed to set aside its judgment, reopen the case, and make additional findings of fact. In obedience to a mandate of this court the Court of Claims set aside its judgment, took additional proof, made new findings, and again concluded that the claimant was not entitled to a recovery. 55 Ct. Cl. 188. That judgment is here for review.\n From the amended findings of fact it appears that Nicholas entered the customs service in 1899 as an inspector; that the committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to examine into and report the conduct of the customs service at Baltimore, made a report from which they concluded that owing to the conduct of Nicholas, and from personal observation, they were of the opinion that the service would be benefited by his removal therefrom. On February 5, 1913, the Secretary of the Treasury approved this recommendation, and instructed the Collector of Customs at Baltimore to remove the claimant on account of his use of intoxicating liquors, and the unsatisfactory and perfunctory manner in which he performed his work. On February 20, 1913, he was removed from the service. At the time of his dismissal he was in the classified civil service, and had no notice of any charges against him. On August 24, 1912, Congress passed and act authorizing the President to reorganize the \n\n[257 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n customs service. 37 Stat. c. 355, p. 434 (Comp. St.  5327). This reorganization was reported to Congress March 3, 1913. Thirty-three inspectors of customs were provided for the district of Maryland, including the state of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the city of Alexandria, Va., which offices were filled since March 13, 1913, by persons appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury; claimant made no appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury at the time of his removal from office; he was willing and physically able to resume the duties of the office, and capable of discharging the same, but did not apply for reinstatement at any time, nor notify the Secretary of the Treasury of his desire therefor, or for a revocation of the order for his dismissal.\n It appears that the petition was filed in the Court of Claims more than three years after the claimant had been removed from office. It alleged that, being able and willing to discharge the duties of the office, plaintiff was entitled to compensation because of his illegal removal by failure to comply with the provisions of the Act of August 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 555:\n'Sec. 6. That no person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of said service and for reasons given in writing, and the person whose removal is sought shall have notice of the same and of any charges preferred against him, and be furnished with a copy thereof, and also be allowed a reasonable time for personally answering the same in writing; and affidavits in support thereof; but no examination of witnesses nor any trial or hearing shall be required except in the discretion of the officer making the removal; and copies of charges, notice of hearing, answers, reasons for removal, and of the order of removal shall be made a part of the records of the proper department or office, as shall also the reasons for reduction in rank or compensation; and \n\n[257 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n copies of the same shall be furnished to the person affected upon request, and the Civil Service Commission also shall, upon request, be furnished copies of the same.'\n\n The purpose of this statute, as its terms plainly show, is to require that one in the classified civil service of the United States have an opportunity to know of the charges against him before removal with an opportunity to answer them, and, if awarded a trial, to have one before the officer empowered to act in the matter. The question presented is whether the plaintiff may recover his salary when removed without compliance with the statute, where he delays taking any steps to test the legality of his removal, or asking for an opportunity to be heard, for the length of time herein shown.\n We agree with the Court of Claims that a person illegally dismissed from office is not thereby exonerated from obligation to take steps for his own protection and may not for an unreasonable length of time acquiesce in the order of removal, which it was within the power of the Secretary to make, and then recover for the salary attached to the position. In cases of unreasonable delay he may be held to have abandoned title to the office and any right to recover its emoluments. The claimant relies upon the Wickersham Case, \n201 U.S. 390\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 469. In that case this court held that one entitled to the protection of a rule, or statute, requiring notice to be given him could not legally be separated from the service by suspension without compliance with the rule or statute, and was entitled to compensation during the period of his wrongful suspension. In that case the record disclosed that Wickersham was suspended on November 1, 1897, and that on November 5, 1897, he protested against his suspension, and on December 28, 1897, demanded his salary. The case did not present and there was no occasion to decide the question of the effect of delay and acquiescence upon the right to recover compensation. It appeared that Wickersham \n\n[257 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n was diligent in asserting his rights, as well as ready and willing to discharge the duties of the government employment in which he was engaged.\n It must be remembered that we are dealing with the discharge of public duties which it is important shall be carried on regardless of the personnel of those who discharge them. While one inducted into office or public employment is entitled to the privileges or emoluments thereof, until legally separated therefrom, he is not absolved from the duty of diligence upon his part in the assertion of his right to the office, or to the compensation attached thereto. Public policy requires that the government shall be seasonably advised of the attitude of its officers and employees attempted to be displaced when they assert illegal removal or suspension as a basis for the recovery of the office or its emoluments. This is necessary in order that proper action may be taken in the public interest, as well as that which is required to vindicate the rights of one wrongfully removed from the public service. This principle was recognized in United States ex rel. Arant v. Lane, \n249 U.S. 367\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 293. That case was one in mandamus to compel the restoration of an officer, who alleged that he was wrongfully removed without notice or an opportunity to be heard, and it was held that a delay of 20 months barred by laches his right to the writ. The reasoning of the opinion, and the comments as to the character of public employment and the conduct required of one who would assert his rights when wrongfully deprived of them, are apposite here. The findings in this case disclose that plaintiff took no steps to question the order dismissing him from the service, nor to ask for a copy of the charges upon which he was removed. He did nothing for his vindication until he brought this suit 3 years after his removal from the office, to recover compensation. We hold, therefore, as did the Court of Claims, that such a lack of diligence evidenced an \n\n[257 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n abandonment of his title to the office, and of his right to recover the emoluments thereof.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNICKEL v. COLE(1921)\nNo. 268\nArgued: March 24, 1921Decided: April 25, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 222, 223]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward F. Treadwell, of San Francisco, Cal., and Azro E. Cheney, of Reno, Nev., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Leonard B. Fowler, of Carson City, Nev., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first of these suits was brought by the Controller of Nevada to collect a transfer tax alleged to be due under a statute of Nevada approved on March 26, 1913, to take effect thirty days from that date. Nevada Stats. of 1913, c. 266, p. 411. The second suit was brought to quiet title to the shares of stock in respect of which the tax was assessed-to establish that there was no lien upon or claim against them for the tax. The two cases were \n\n[256 U.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n heard together in the state courts and here upon the same facts. The Supreme Court of Nevada held that the tax was due and decided in favor of the State. The parties on the other side had set up and claimed immunity under the Constitution of the United States, especially the Fourteenth Amendment, and brought the cases here by writ of error. By way of caution they also filed a petition for certiorari which has not yet been passed upon by this Court.\n The facts are these: Henry Miller, a resident of California, was the owner of 119,875.75 shares of the stock of Miller & Lux, Incorporated, a Nevada corporation. Miller & Lux, Incorporated, owned the stock of the Pacific Live Stock Company, a California corporation, and the latter owned real estate and personal property in Nevada appraised at $1,431,236.86. On April 17, 1913, after the above mentioned statute had been passed but before it went into operation, Miller in California made a will, and at the same time a deed of trust conveying his stock to the plaintiffs in error, in trust for himself for life and after his death upon limitations similar to those in his will-any payment under the will to be in satisfaction of the provisions both in the will and in the deed. The deed contained no power of revocation. The stock was endorsed and delivered to the trustees and thereafter was retained by them. Miller died on October 14, 1916. The statute imposes a tax upon the transfer of all property which shall pass in trust or otherwise by will or by statutes of inheritance or by deed or gift made without valuable and adequate consideration in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor, or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death.\n The plaintiffs in error admit that if the statute had been in operation at the time of the transfer the tax would have been due, so that it is not necessary to go into further particulars about the act. But they say that the \n\n[256 U.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n interest of the remaindermen after the death of Miller vested upon the execution of the deed and that therefore the statute did not apply to them, and could not do so consistently with the Constitution of the United States.\n We shall not discuss the postulate of the argument for the plaintiffs in error-the notion that a tax upon transfers imposed by a statute passed after the transfers had taken place would be void. In this case the statute was passed before the date of the deed of trust and therefore undeniably could have been drawn so as to tax the transaction. Reading as it did it possibly might have been construed as doing so, notwithstanding the postponement of the date for its going into operation, and so construed would have been good as against constitutional objections.\n But the plaintiffs in error say that what we pronounce possible is not what the Supreme Court of Nevada did. The Supreme Court of Nevada seems to have conceded that if the interest of those who took upon Miller's death was vested when the deed was delivered the statute did not and perhaps could not apply. They reached the result by holding that the execution of the deed and will was one transaction and gave no vested right until Miller's death. Thereupon the plaintiffs in error say that the above limitation to the statute being admitted the State Court could not avoid the supposed constitutional difficulty by assuming a view of the instrument that is deemed to be plainly untenable as held by the Chief Justice dissenting, and contrary to the law of California where the parties lived and the transfer was made. Nickel v. State, 179 Cal. 126, 175 Pac. 641. But the answer to this is that when as here there can be no pretence that the Court adopted its view in order to evade a constitutional issue, and the case has been decided upon grounds that have no relation to any federal question, this Court accepts the decision whether right or wrong.

And when, as here, the statute unquestionably might have made the tax applicable to this transfer, we do not inquire very curiously into the reasoning by which the statute is held to justify the tax. 'As there was state power to tax ... the question whether or not the ... interest [of the plaintiffs in error] under the circumstances was correctly subjected to the tax was a purely state question.' Moffitt v. Kelly, \n218 \nU.S. 400, 405\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 79, 81 (54 L. Ed. 1086, 30 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1179).

The amount was assessed under a statute of the state as a penalty for undue delay in making delivery of an intrastate shipment made March 27, 1918. At that time the railroad was in the possession and control of the government, and was being operated by the Director General under the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp.

Atty Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the Court of Claims, which was argued and submitted at the same time with No. 10, just decided. Judgment was rendered against Norris. 55 Ct. Cl. 208. The case was brought to this court on appeal, and was remanded to the Court of Claims for further findings.\n It appears that Norris was a customs employee at the port of Baltimore. On July 2, 1907, he was made a customs inspector at the compensation of $4 per day. On February 20, 1913, he was advised by the collector of customs that his services as inspector would be dispensed with and his position vacated at the close of business on that day. On December 22, 1913, he addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury, in which he stated that he had been dismissed from the service on the previous February 20th; that no reason was assigned for the dismissal, nor charges furnished him, nor opportunity given him to be heard as provided by section 6 of the Act of August 24, 1912. 37 Stat. 555 ( Comp. St.  3287). He stated that, therefore, his dismissal seemed contrary to law, and asked for reinstatement, and an examination of his case on the merits as prescribed in that act. The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on January 12, 1914, replied in substance that, as it appeared that he had been removed without being furnished a copy of the charges, the Department was willing to request the Civil Service Commission to issue a certificate for his reinstatement, and give him a written copy of the charges which led to his separation from the service. In reply to this letter the claimant wrote the Secretary of the Treasury, renewing his request for reinstatement. On February 10, 1914, Norris' rein \n\n[257 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n statement was requested, in order that he might be furnished with a copy of the charges and allowed to answer them. On the same day the Assistant Secretary wrote the collector at Baltimore, inclosing a letter reinstating the plaintiff, and adding that, upon Norris subscribing to the oath of office, he would be suspended pending an investigation of the charges. On February 12, 1914, the Treasury Department requested the Civil Service Commission to issue the necessary certificate for the reinstatement of Norris as inspector of customs, in order that he might be given the opportunity to answer the charges against him. on February 20, 1914, by direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, Norris was reinstated, and appointed an Inspector of Customs, in order that he might be given an opportunity to answer the charges which resulted in his removal. Plaintiff executed the oath of office on March 5, 1914. He was suspended from duty and pay; charges were preferred against him. On March 9, 1914, Norris answered the charges. On April 25, 1914, the Treasury Department, by the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, advised that the Department was of the opinion that the charges and the evidence against the plaintiff were not sufficient to have warranted his dismissal, stating, however, that inasmuch as there was no vacancy at that time in the force of customs inspectors, plaintiff's services could not be utilized; that the position of inspector was created in order that he might take the oath of office so that the charges against him could be tried; that his services would therefore necessarily be dispensed with; the order would be effective upon receipt of the letter by the collector of customs at the port of Baltimore, and the position abolished; that plaintiff was eligible for reinstatement within one year, provided his services could be utilized and he should be properly recommended for an existing vacancy. On May 27, 1914, a letter was written by the president of the National Asso \n\n[257 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n ciation of Customs Inspectors, asking for the reinstatement of Norris. On June 6, 1914, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury responded that there was no position of inspector vacant at Baltimore; that Norris was entitled to reinstatement, and, should a vacancy occur, he would be given consideration. On February 18, 1915, the plaintiff wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking for reinstatement to the position of inspector of customs.\n In the additional findings it appears that after the plaintiff was dismissed he remained a few months in Baltimore, and then went to a farm in Virginia; that he occasionally visited in Baltimore, and that no facts appear to show that he was not ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of the office up to and including May 16, 1916, and at the time of the taking of his deposition in August, 1919\n\n\n The question is, upon these findings, and the additional findings: Is the claimant entitled to recover the compensation which is sought by his petition in this case? It appears that, during the period of 11 months after his suspension without compliance with the statute, plaintiff took no steps to vindicate his right to the office, nor to recover the compensation incident to the same.\n We need not repeat the discussion in the Nicholas Case, \n257 U.S. 71\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 7, No. 10, just decided, of the principles which we deem controlling in cases of this character. The question here is: Did Norris use reasonable diligence, in view of the obligation placed upon him, notwithstanding his wrongful removal, to assert his right to the compensation attached to the office? It is true that it has been found that he was ready, willing, and able to discharge its duties, but no fact is found explaining his failure to assert his right to the office, or its emoluments, for the period of 11 months and a little over. He did not, as did Wickersham (U. S. v. Wickersham, 201 \n\n[257 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 390, 26 Sup. Ct. 469), promptly demand a restoration to the office, nor make any claim to its emoluments because the power of removal had been exercised without giving him the opportunity for a hearing which the statute affords. Each case must be decided upon its own facts, and we are of opinion that the findings here do not disclose that exercise of reasonable diligence on Norris' part which the law imposes upon him as a duty if he would recover compensation for services in an office which the government might fill with another, or otherwise adjust its service so as to dispense with the service of the plaintiff. Public policy requires reasonable diligence upon the plaintiff's part, which we think the findings in this record do not disclose.\n It is contended that claimant is entitled to recover after his reinstatement, although the office, which the findings show was created for the purpose of affording Norris a hearing, was immediately abolished. If the office was legally abolished it follows, of course, that the courts cannot afford him relief. The power of the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the number of inspectors to be employed cannot be reasonably questioned. Nor can the power of removal be doubted. It is included in the power to appoint; the statute not otherwise providing. Burnap v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 512, 515\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 374. The objection urged upon our attention is that the order was made by an Assistant Secretary. We have no doubt of the authority of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury to take this action. Section 245 of the Revised Statutes ( Comp. St.  379) provides:\n'The Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury shall examine letters, contracts, and warrants prepared for the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury, and perform such other duties in the office of the Secretary of the Treasury as may be prescribed by the Secretary or by law.'\n\n Section 161 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  235) gives to the \n\n[257 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n heads of the Departments the right to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the government of their respective departments, the conduct of its officers and clerks, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of the records, papers and property appertaining to it. Moreover the action of the Assistant Secretary in this case was reduced to writing and became a part of the archives of the Department. It does not appear to have been modified, nor in any way changed, by the Secretary. There is nothing in the record to show that the action of the Assistant Secretary did not have the full sanction and approval of the Secretary. Under such circumstances the act of the Assistant Secretary must be presumed to be within the scope of the authority which the Secretary conferred upon his assistant. McCollum v. United States, 17 Ct. Cl. 92.\n We are of opinion that, after the order restoring Norris for the purpose of a hearing by creating a place for him, and abolishing the office after the hearing, there can be no recovery. It follows that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTH DAKOTA v.

State of Minnesota, No. 15, Original, to consolidate that case with this, if counsel are so advised, to the end that the possibility may be considered of alleviating flood conditions in Lake Traverse and along the Bois de Sioux river by other means than the injunction prayed for in that case and to permit South Dakota to take testimony at the hearing now ordered in this case. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTH PAC S S CO. v. SOLEY(1921)\nNo. 63\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 216, 217]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ernest Clewe and Frank W. Aitken, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appeallant.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Christopher M. Bradley, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here solely upon the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the suit. The bill was filed in the District Court by the North Pacific Steamship Company against the Industrial Accident Commission of California, William T. Soley, and H. I Mulcrevy, County Clerk of the City and County of San Francisco. The bill alleged that the complainant was engaged in the business of transportation in interstate commerce between various points on the Pacific coast, and operated the steamer Breakwater; that on or about the 12th of June, 1916, the said steamer, then in the navigable waters of the United States loading cargo, had in its \n\n[257 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n employ the respondent, Soley, as a stevedore, and that said Soley was injured by falling down a hatchway of the steamer; that on the 27th day of November, 1916, Soley filed an application with the Industrial Accident Commission for damages under the Compensation Act of California (St. Cal. 1913, p. 279); that, after a hearing the Commission made the following award:\n'1. Cash in hand the sum of two hundred eighty-one dollars and twenty- five cents ($281.25), this amount being the sum of weekly payments of said disability indemnity accrued up to and including the 18th day of December, 1916, less, however, the sum of thirty dollars ($30.00) to be deducted therefrom and paid to Herbert N. Ellis as his attorney's fees, as attorney for the applicant herein.\n\n'2. the further sum of eleven dollars and twenty five cents ($11.25) per week payable weekly in advance beginning with the 19th day of December, 1916, until the termination of said disability or the further order of this Commission, the total of payment however not to exceed two hundred and forty weeks.\n\n'3. Cash in hand the sum of five hundred fifteen dollars and thirty- five cents ($515.35) for medical and hospital services rendered as follows.\n\n Agnew Sanitarium $149.85 Dr. E. H. Crabtree 152.00 Dr. Maynard C. Harding 203.50 Dr. L. C. Kinney, for X-ray 10.00\"\n\n The bill averred that by virtue of the award the complainant had been ordered to pay Soley $3,015.35.\n The bill further alleged that at the time of his injury Soley was engaged in the performance of a maritime contract aboard a vessel in the navigable waters of the United States engaged in interstate commerce; that his remedy was exclusively within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction \n\n[257 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n of the courts of the United States; that under section 26 of the Compensation Act a certified copy of the findings and award may be filed with the clerk of the Superior Court, and, that upon filing the copy of the findings and the award, execution may be issued upon the judgment; that Soley had filed certified copies of the findings and the award with the clerk of the Superior Court, and unless restrained by injunction, would cause execution to be issued thereon for the purpose of making the amount of the award out of the property of the complainant. The bill prayed an injunction against any steps for the enforcement of the award.\n Respondent, Soley, appeared and answered, and, among other things, set up:\n'Defendant denies that the value of the matter in controversy herein exclusive of interest and costs exceeds the sum of three thousand dollars; and alleges that the weekly indemnity of eleven and 25\/100 dollars awarded to defendant from complainant under the terms of said award and judgment was contingent upon the continuance of defendant's total disability, as appears at the foot of page 4 of complainant's bill, and that at the time of the filing of complainant's bill herein defendant's said total disability had terminated and all of complainant's subsequent liability under the terms of said award of the Industrial Accident Commission of the State of California had ceased; that the total liability of complainant under said judgment sought herein to be enjoined does not and will not exceed exclusive of interest and costs the sum of thirteen hundred eighty-one and 60\/100 dollars ($1,381.60).'\n\n In order that the District Court have jurisdiction of the cause it was necessary that the amount in controversy exceed exclusive of interest and costs the sum or value of $3,000. Judicial Code,  24 (Comp. St.  991 ). Section 37 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1019) provides:\n'That if in any suit commenced in the District \n\n[257 U.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n Court ... it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said District Court, at any time after such suit has been brought, ... that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said District Court , ... the ... court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit ... and shall make such order as to costs as may be just.'\n\n Section 37, with the substitution of District Court for Circuit Court, is a re-enactment of the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, 472.\n The objection that jurisdiction to entertain the suit did not exist is one which may be taken by answer. Anderson v. Watt, \n138 U.S. 694\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 449. Indeed, under section 37 it is the duty of the court when it shall appear to its satisfaction that the suit does not really and substantially involve the necessary amount to give it jurisdiction, to dismiss the same, and this the court may do whether the parties raise the question or not. In the present case the issue was raised by answer, and, therefore, it became necessary for the court to determine the question of jurisdiction upon the facts presented, and when brought directly here, it is the duty of this Court to review the decision upon the testimony as one presenting a jurisdictional question. Wetmore v. Rymer, \n169 U.S. 115\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 293; Gilbert v. David, \n235 U.S. 561\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 164.\n The award upon which the suit was brought provided for the payment of $ 11.25 per week in advance beginning on September 19, 1916, until the termination of Soley's disability or the further order of the Commission, the total period of payment not to exceed 240 weeks. Upon the hearing upon the question of jurisdiction a copy of the findings and award of the Commission was put in evidence. Soley was called, and testified among other things, that after his doctor told him that he was cured he went back to work on or about December 10, 1917, and had been working ever since, and had made no claim upon \n\n[257 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n his employer since that time. An order of the Commission, filed August 25, 1919, was introduced in evidence, from which the Commission found that the disability suffered by Solely terminated on the 10th day of December, 1917; that the disability indemnity payable to him up to and including December 10, 1917, amounted to $855, which together with the medical expenses theretofore awarded amounted to $515.35, making a total of $1,307.35, the total liability of the company to Soley by reason of his injury. It was also stipulated between the parties that the award in favor of Soley, a copy of which was in evidence, had been filed in the office of the clerk of the city and county of San Francisco, that a writ of execution had issued against the complainant on November 12, 1917, to satisfy said judgment to the extent of the amount which had accrued under such findings and award, which was less than $1,500; that said writ was returned unsatisfied; that the application of Soley for the termination of the award was made on August 20, 1919\n\n\n A witness was called who testified that at the time of the injury to Soley the steamer Breakwater was engaged in interstate commerce between ports on the Pacific coast.\n Upon these facts the District Court found that the jurisdictional amount was not involved. In our judgment it did not err in reaching that conclusion. The award provided for weekly payments until the termination of the disability or until the further order of the Commission. The testimony showed that Solely had been pronounced cured by his physician, and had returned to work on December 10, 1917, eight days before the action was brought. The order of the Commission, terminating the disability indemnity, found that the disability suffered by reason of the injury had terminated on December 10, 1917, and that the total liability of the defendant was $1,307.35. Under \n\n[257 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n these circumstances the court reached the conclusion that the jurisdictional amount was not involved. This conclusion, being sustained by the evidence, it was the duty of the court to proceed no further with the case.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOGLESBY GROCERY CO. v.

U S(1921)\nNo. 134\nArgued: January 13, 1921Decided: March 7, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. William R. Harr and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action brought by appellant is for the recovery of certain balances amounting to the sum of $4,288.01, being the difference between the amounts paid at certain rates for transportation of the effects of army officers changing stations and those which it is alleged were legally chargeable.\n The Court of Claims adjudged that appellant was not \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n entitled to recover and dismissed its petition. The cost of printing the record in the case was awarded to the United States.\n There were findings of fact which show that the rates were presented for payment to the proper accounting officers of the government in the regular way and payments were made by the disbursing officers of the government on vouchers certified to be correct and presented by appellant. The charges so presented and paid were at rates for such transportation over land-grant roads fixed in certain agreements known as the 'land-grant equalization agreements' by which, to quote from the findings:\n'The carriers agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not material to be noted, to accept for transportation all property moved by the Quartermaster Corps, United States Army, and for which the United States is lawfully entitled to reduced rates over land-grant roads, the lowest net rates lawfully available, as derived through deductions account of landgrant distance from a lawful rate filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission from point of origin to destination at time of movement.'\n\n That is, such freight was accepted by the carriers without prepayment of the charges therefor upon the basis of the commercial or tariff rates with appropriate deductions on account of land-grant distance as provided in the Railroad Land-Grant Acts. It is manifest, therefore, that the commercial rates were higher than the land-grant rates, and this action is to recover the difference between them and the land-grant rates presented for payment, as we have said, by appellant, and paid by the transportation officers of the government.\n After stating the action to be 'for the recovery of various amounts aggregating $4,288.01, in addition to those paid on account of 176 items of freight transportation furnished to and paid for by the United States,' the \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n court, by Mr. Justice Downey, said the action--\n'is for a sum as to each item of transportation in addition to that already claimed and paid as claimed for the same items and is not for any other or different or additional service nor for omitted items.'\n\n And further:\n'The case therefore involves not only the question of the applicability of land-grant rates to this class of freight transportation, a question already decided adversely by this court, but it involves further questions as to the right, under the circumstances of the case, to now recover amounts not then claimed.'\n\n The decision referred to is Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. United States, 50 Ct. Cl. 412, and the ground of its ruling was that the freight transported was not the property of the United States, it being the effects of army officers, and therefore was not entitled to land-grant deductions, but was subject to the commercial tariff. Necessarily, therefore, the pending case must turn on other questions for the property transported was the property of army officers, and subject, therefore, independently of other considerations, to the commercial rates. Appellant in the present case was paid sums less than those rates, and there is left for consideration only its present right to recover the difference between them and the land-grant rates; the latter being those that were paid.\n The government, however, is not inclined to that limitation of the issue, and attacks the ruling of which it is the consequence, and repeats the contention decided against it in that case, and again insists that the property transported was government property and entitled to land-grant rates and all else is irrelevant. To this appellant replies that the government did not appeal from the decision and must be considered as having accepted it. The effect is rather large to attribute to mere nonaction, but we need not make further comment upon it \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n because we think the decision of the Court of Claims was correct. The personal baggage of an officer is not property of the United States and as such entitled to transportation at land-grant rates, and we are brought to the grounds of recovery urged by appellant.\n There are reasons for and against them. The assertion is of a right of action and recovery against apparently a concession during a long course of years to an explicit and contrary assertion by the government. Appellant attempts to explain the concession or, let us say, its nonaction, as the compulsion of circumstances, and of a belief of the futility of action, and now urges that it never intended to relinquish but always intended to assert its right. The record, however, has much against this explanation, or that cannot be accommodated to it, if we may ascribe to appellant the usual impulses and interest that influence men.\n It 'and its predecessor company, whose properties, franchises, and accounts it acquired, charged upon its books' the transportation charges at land-grant rates and not at regular commercial rates, so rendered its bills to the government, and received payment without protest or the assertion of a greater compensation. And there was prompting to protest and such assertion. In 1904, according to a finding, 'the Union Pacific stated a claim against the United States at regular tariff rates for transportation of household goods and professional books of an officer of the army over the railroad bridge at Quincy, Ill.' The claim was disallowed, and thereafter the Union Pacific stated its accounts at land- grant rates. It also found that in 1891 and in 1904 there was conversation between the Comptroller of the Treasury and counsel in regard to the rulings of the Comptroller, though not, the Court of Claims says, to a claim then pending before the officer. Appellant, however, was not stirred to either opposition or protest by the incident \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 346]\n\u00a0\n with the Union Pacific or the conversation with the Comptroller, but continued to render its accounts at landgrant rates, and accepted payment without opposition or action until the decision of the Court of Claims in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. v. United States, supra.\n Counsel seem to make a merit of this uncomplaining and unresisting acquiescence and observe that the government by it obtained the advantage of the plea of the statute of limitations. The fact is significant. It is inconsistent with the reservation of a right and an intention to subsequently make a judicial assertion of it. Creditors are not usually so indulgent and the appellant had remedies at hand. The courts were open to it, certainly protest was open to it. Its explanation for this nonaction is not satisfactory. 'It is advised and believes,' is its allegation, and now its contention, that 'its auditors and agents were led and constrained to render its bills and vouchers ... at tariff rates with land-grant deductions because the shipments were for the Quartermaster's Department and upon government bills of lading which in terms are only applicable to 'government property' and 'public property', and also [because] the Comptroller of the Treasury (whose decisions are by law made final and controlling upon the Executive Departments of the government) had held that such transportation, upon government bills of lading, when within the amount authorized to be transported by departmental regulations at the expense of the government, was quasi public property and entitled as such to land-grant rates,' and that it did not intend to waive its right to payment in full or to sue, 'if so advised' for the balances due 'so far as the same were not barred by the statute of limitations.'\n The italics are counsel's and we repeat them as they give emphasis to counsel's conviction of the justification \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 347]\n\u00a0\n of the excuse. We do not share it. The mere mechanism of the bills of lading or their false designations of the property transported could not have imposed on anybody, certainly not on 'the auditors and agents' of a railroad company, and the decisions of the Comptroller were as much open to dispute then as now and resort to suit an inevitable prompting, and yet, we have seen, the statute of limitations was permitted to interpose its bar. The excuse of appellant is hard to credit. Its 'auditors and agents' were not ignorant of affairs, nor unpracticed in the controversies of business, and the means of their settlement. The auditors and agents of railroad companies are not usually complaisant to denials of the rights of the companies they represent. We do not say this in criticism, for such is their duty, the necessary condition of their places.\n We are forced, therefore, to conclude that appellant's nonaction was deliberate, based upon a consideration of its advantages, with no thought of ultimate assertion against the decision of the government until stirred to acquisitiveness by the decision in the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Case, a decision which we may say in passing, was declared by the Court of Claims to have been improvidently given. B. & O. R. R. Co. v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 468.\n The case therefore falls within the rulings of United States v. Bostwick, \n94 U.S. 53\n; Baird v. United States, \n96 U.S. 430\n; Railroad Co. v. United States, \n103 U.S. 703\n; Central Pacific Ry. v. United States, \n164 U.S. 93\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 35. And they have supplemental force in United States v. Edmondston, \n181 U.S. 500\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 718; Utermehle v. Norment, \n197 U.S. 40\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 291, 3 Ann. Cas. 520.\n These views lead to an affirmance of the judgment upon the record as it now stands. It should be said, however, that they are based on the concessions of appellant to the action of the accounting officers, and the \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 348]\n\u00a0\n Court of Claims makes this a point in its decision. The court said that from the 'longcontinued uniform course of action by' appellant 'for a long period of years,' 'it had no intention of claiming anything more in the certified vouchers and paid.' And as to these transactions than that claimed added:\n'All the facts justify this conclusion, for a course of conduct is more potent than assertions of belief unacted on. But if such a conclusion were otherwise subject to question it appears from the evidence that the plaintiff's [appellant] charge upon its books was only of the amount claimed in its vouchers, and that when that amount was paid 'the transaction was behind us.' The quoted language is the language of plaintiff's auditor.'\n\n In explanation of this, it may be said, and in contradiction of its implication, appellant requested findings by the court that the transaction of the appellant and its predecessor company 'was regarded by the auditing department of the company as closed, so far as they were concerned, but as subject to subsequent adjustment or suit in court if subsequently found to be incorrect,' and further that the government considered the accounts between 'the carriers as in the nature of running accounts, subject to correction as the occasion arises, in the light of the law and the facts.' And it is contended that the evidence supports such conclusion. This is disputed by the government, and it is doubtful. The government concedes that a motion to remand the case for additional findings has foundation in the record, but contends 'that the requests are without merit and that the case is fully covered by the facts found,' and adds:\n'Of course, in so far as the motion tends to request the Court of Claims to change findings made it is futile, as the findings are conclusive.'\n\n The government further urges that the proposed amendment to finding VI is covered by findings VI \n\n[255 U.S. 339, 349]\n\u00a0\n and IX, and is only a request 'to change a negative to a positive finding,' that the amendment to finding X is 'rather an argument that certain conclusions should follow from facts found,' and that 'its conclusion, from the facts found, is that both parties regarded the settlements as final, not as tentative.' The amendment to finding XI is, the government says, 'a request to find evidence' which is contrary to the rules, and besides the evidence is immaterial.\n We concur with the government that the request for findings is an effort to change negative to positive findings. The reasoning of the court expresses implicitly, if not explicitly, a view contrary to that expressed in the request. In other words, the court regarded the settlements of appellant with the government as final, and not as tentative.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOWNBEY v. MORGAN(1921)\nNo. 99\nArgued: November 18, 1920Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.[ Ownbey v. Morgan \n256 U.S. 94\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[256 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Willard Saulsbury, of Wilmington, Del., and Harlan F. Stone, of New York City, for defendants in error. \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error brings under review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Delaware, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court in a proceeding brought by defendants in error by foreign attachment against the property of plaintiff in error pursuant to the statutes of that state.\n Proceedings were commenced in the Superior Court \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n December 23, 1915, by the filing of an affidavit entitled in the cause, made by one Joyce, a credible person, and setting forth that defendant Ownbey resided out of the state and was justly indebted to plaintiffs in a sum exceeding $50. Thereupon a writ of foreign attachment was issued to the sheriff of New Castle county, which plaintiffs caused to be indorsed with a memorandum to the effect that special bail was required in the sum of $200,000, and under which the sheriff attached 33,324 1\/3 shares of stock (par value $5 each) held and owned by defendant in the Wootten Land & Fuel Company, a Delaware corporation, and made a proper return. Plaintiffs filed a declaration demanding recovery of $200,000, counting upon a combination of the common money counts in assumpsit. Whether such pleading was required or even permitted by the statutes is questionable; but this is not material for present purposes. Not long afterwards, defendant, by attorneys, without giving security, went through the form of entering a general appearance, and filed pleas of non assumpsit, the statute of limitations, and payment. Plaintiff's attorneys moved to strike out the appearance and pleas on the ground that special bail or security as required by the statute in suits instituted by attachment had not been given. To this motion defendant filed a written response setting up that the Wootten Land & Fuel Company, although a Delaware corporation, was engaged in coal mining and all its other activities and business in the states of Colorado and New Mexico, where it had large and valuable property; that defendant was a resident of Colorado, and the stock in said company attached in this case constituted substantially all his property; that the company was in the hands of a receiver, and because of this the market value of the shares attached was temporarily destroyed, so that they were unavailable for use in obtaining the required bail or security to procure the discharge of the \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n shares from attachment, and that it was impossible for defendant to secure bail or security in the sum of $200,000, or any adequate sum, for the release of the shares so attached; that defendant had a good defense, in that there was no indebtedness upon any account or in any sum due from him to plaintiffs; that by the true construction of the Delaware statutes the entry of bail or security for the discharge of the property attached was not a necessary prerequisite to the entry of defendant's appearance, and such appearance might be made without disturbing the seizure of property under the writ or its security for any judgment finally entered; and that if the statutes could not be so construed as to permit appearance and defense in a case begun by foreign attachment without the entry of bail or security for the discharge of the property seized, they were unconstitutional under the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that (a) they abridged the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; (b) deprived defendants in cases brought under them of property without due process of law; and (c) denied to such defendants the equal protection of the laws.\n Upon motion of plaintiffs this response and the attempted appearance and pleas of defendant were struck out upon the ground that special bail or security as required by the statute had not been given by defendant or any person for him; the court in banc holding that in a foreign attachment suit against an individual there could be no appearance without entering 'special bail,' that the requirement to that effect was not arbitrary or unreasonable, and the statute was not unconstitutional. Morgan v. Ownbey, 29 Del. (6 Boyce) 379, 398-406, 100 Atl. 411.\n Thereupon judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant for want of appearance was ordered, collectible only from the property attached, the amount to be ascertained by inquisition at bar. The inquisition afterwards proceeded, and resulted in the finding of damages \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n to the amount of $200,168.57, for which final judgment was entered.\n Defendant repeatedly asked that the proceedings be opened and he be permitted to appear and disprove or avoid plaintiff's debt or claim, saying that shortly after the issuance of the writ of attachment, and as soon as advised thereof, he had proceeded to Delaware, retained counsel, and used every possible effort to secure bail in the sum of $200,000, offering the attached stock as collateral security to indemnify a surety, but because the property of the Wootten Company was in the hands of a receiver he had found it impossible to obtain any surety; and that he was not at present nor was he at the time of the issuance of the writ of foreign attachment indebted to plaintiffs in any sum whatever, but had a just and legal defense to the whole of the alleged cause of action. These applications were denied, upon opinions of the court in banc (29 Del. [6 Boyce] 417, 434-436, 100 Atl, 411), and the Superior Court ordered the shares of stock in question sold in order to satisfy the debt, interest, and costs.\n The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment (7 Boyce, 297, 105 Atl. 838, 849), and the case comes here upon the contention that the statutes of Delaware, as thus construed and applied, are repugnant to the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The statutes are found in the Delaware Revised Code of 1915, and the provisions bearing upon the controversy are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[256 U.S. 94, 102]\n\u00a0\n The principal contention is based upon the 'due process of law' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is said the essential element of due process-the right to appear and be heard in defense of the action-is lacking. But the statute in plain terms gives to defendant the \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n opportunity to appear and make his defense, conditioned only upon his giving security to the value of the property attached. Hence the question reduces itself to whether this condition is an arbitrary and unreasonable requirement, so inconsistent with established modes of administering justice that it amounts to a denial of due process. And this must be determined not alone with reference \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 104]\n\u00a0\n to a case of peculiar hardship arising out of exceptional circumstances, but with respect to the general effect and operation of the system of procedure established by the statutes.\n The act concerning foreign attachments has been upon the statute books of Delaware since early colonial days. Like the attachment acts of other states, it traces its origin to the custom of London, under which a creditor might attach money or goods of the defendant either in plaintiff's own hands or in the custody of a third person, by proceedings in the mayor's court or in the sheriff's court. The subject is treated at large in Bohun's Privilegia Londini (3d Ed. 1723) p. 253 et seq. See also Bac. Abr. (Bouv. Ed.), tit. Customs of London (H); Com. Dig. (4th Ed.) tit. Attachment, Foreign (A); Pulling, Laws & Customs of London (2d Ed.) 187 et seq.; Serg. Attach. Appendix, p. 205 et seq. As is said in Drake on Attachment,  3:\n'This custom, notwithstanding its local and limited character, was doubtless known to our ancestors, when they sought a new home on the Western continent, and its essential principle, brought hither by them, has, in varied forms, become incorporated into the legal systems of all our states. ... Our circumstances as a nation have tended peculiarly to give importance to a remedy of this character. The division of our extended domain into many different states, each limitedly sovereign within its territory, inhabited by a people enjoying unrestrained privilege of transit from place to place in each state, and from state to state, taken in connection with the universal and unexampled expansion of credit, and the prevalent abolishment of imprisonment for debt, would naturally, and of necessity, lead to the establishment, and, as experience has demonstrated, the enlargement and extension, of remedies acting upon the property of debtors.'\n\n By the custom a defendant could not appear or raise \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 105]\n\u00a0\n an issue about the debt claimed without entering special bail, or else surrendering his body. Andrews v. Clerke, Carth. 25, 26. Hence it naturally came about that the American colonies and states, in adopting foreign attachment as a remedy for collecting debts due from nonresident or absconding debtors, in many instances made it a part of the procedure that if defendant desired to enter an appearance and contest plaintiff's demand he must first give substantial security, usually in the form of special bail. Besides Delaware, this was true of New Jersey (Pat. L. p. 296,  7; Id., p. 298,  16 ; Watson v. Noblett, 65 N. J. Law, 506, 508, 47 Atl. 438); Pennsylvania (McClenachan v. McCarty, 1 Dall, 375, 378); Maryland (Campbell v. Morris, 3 Har. & McH. 535, 552, 553); Virginia (Tiernans v. Schley, 2 Leigh, 25, 29); North Carolina (Britt v. Patterson, 31 N. C. 197, 200; Alexander v. Taylor, 62 N. C. 36, 38); South Carolina (Acock v. Linn, Harp. 368, 369, 370; Fife v. Clarke, 3 McCord, 347, 352; Callender v. Duncan, 2 Bailey, 454); Tennessee (Boyd v. Buckingham, 10 Humph. 434, 437); and Ohio (1 Chase's Stat. 462,  15, cited by counsel in Voorhees v. Bank of United States, 10 Pet. 449, 453).\n As to the legislation in Delaware, where the system is authoritatively deduced from the Custom of London (Reybold v. Parker, 6 Houst, 544, 555; Revnolds v. Howell, 1 Marv. 52, 59; Fowler v. Dickson, 24 Del. [1 Boyce] 113, 119, 74 Atl. 601), not stopping to trace early colonial laws mentioned in Reybold v. Parker, supra (6 Houst. 553), we find that an act providing for proceedings by attachment against nonresident as well as against absconding debtors was passed by the Assembly of the Delaware Counties and the Province of Pennsylvania March 24, 1770 (Del. Laws 1753-1777, pp. 165, 174); was supplemented by acts of the Legislature of the state of Delaware of January 31, 1817 (Del. Laws 1817, p. 232, c. 133), and January 27, 1823 (Del. Laws 1822-1824, p. 261, c. 162), and found \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 106]\n\u00a0\n its way, without change material to the present purpose, into Delaware Revised Code of 1852, as chapter 104. By section 3 (Code,  2266) a defendant desiring to enter appearance was required to put in special bail to the value of the property attached.\n In 1856 it was held by the Superior Court that the act did not extend to foreign corporations; and this because a corporation could not put in special bail or be surrendered to bail when it appeared, and, in the absence of provision for the security to be given, it must be held that the statute did not contemplate or include the case of such a corporation. Vogle v. New Granada Canal Co., 1 Houst. 294, 299. To remedy this, a supplement was enacted March 2, 1857 (11 Del. Laws, 482, c. 424), providing that the writ might be issued against a foreign corporation and like proceedings be had thereon as in other cases, except that the attachment should be dissolved only by defendant bringing into court the sum of money specified as the plaintiff's demand in the affidavit on which the writ was issued, or giving security for the payment of any judgment recovered; but that an appearance might be entered for defendant without bringing in the money or giving the security mentioned, in which case the writ should continue to bind the property attached. An amendment passed March 17, 1875 (15 Del. Laws, 305, 306, cc. 181, 182), eliminated the express provision for appearance without dissolving the attachment, and amended the provision as to the form of security to be given, leaving the section to stand as it appears in Rev. Code Del. 1915,  4143 (section 26), quoted in the margin, supra. Notwithstanding this amendment, it seems to be thought that in attachment against a foreign corporation the entry of security is still not a prerequisite to appearance, and necessary only if it be desired to discharge the garnishees and the property attached (2 Woolley, Del. Prac.  1293), and in favor of plaintiff in error we shall so assume. \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 107]\n\u00a0\n Meantime, the provision requiring a nonresident individual to enter special bail as a condition of making appearance remained as before until March 6, 1877, when the Legislature substituted a provision requiring security to be given to the satisfaction of the plaintiff or of the court to the value of the property attached and costs, conditioned that befendant answer the plaintiff's demand and satisfy any judgment recovered, to the extent of the value of the property attached. 15 Del. Laws, 612, c. 473. In this form it is found in Rev. Code Del. 1915,  4123 (section 6), quoted in the margin, supra.\n It will be seen that from the beginning the giving of security, either in the form of special bail or a substituted undertaking for the payment of the judgment, has been made a condition precedent to the entering of appearance and making defense upon the merits by a nonresident individual defendant whose property was taken under foreign attachment. In the present case the court in banc called attention to the hardship occasionally arising from this, and suggested that the Legislature provide a remedy. Morgan v. Ownbey, 29 Del. (6 Boyce) 435, 100 Atl. 411. There followed an amendatory act of March 23, 1917 (29 Del. Laws, 844, c. 258), permitting an appearance and defense without the giving of special security, but leaving the lien upon the property attached to remain as security pro tanto, which was made to apply, subject to conditions, to all suits instituted (as this one was) after January 1, 1915. Whether plaintiff in error was at liberty to avail himself of this statute we are not advised; and for present purposes it will be disregarded.\n The courts of Delaware at all times have laid emphasis upon the difference between the original character of a suit by foreign attachment, treating it as an ex parte proceeding quasi in rem, looking to a judgment of condemnation against the property attached and having the incidental object of compelling defendant's appearance, \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 108]\n\u00a0\n on the one hand, and the action in personam, with its appropriate incidents, that resulted from an appearance by defendant accompanied by the giving of security, on the other. Wells v. Shreve's Administrator ( 1861) 2 Houst. 329, 369-370; Frankel v. Satterfield (1890) 9 Houst. 201, 209, 19 Atl. 898; Nat. Bank of W. & B. v. Furtick (1895) 2 Marv. 35, 51, 42 Atl. 479, 44 L. R. A. 115, 69 Am. St. Rep. 99. Recognizing the fundamental character of this distinction, and regarding the foreign attachment in Delaware as wholly statutory, the courts have not felt at liberty, in the absence of legislation, to give to the proceeding a hybrid character by permitting an appearance without security other than the property attached, leaving this to answer pro tanto the plaintiff's demand.\n The requirement of special bail as a condition of appearance was long familiar in bailable actions at common law and in admiralty proceedings. In requiring such bail from a nonresident defendant whose goods had been seized and who desired to be heard to contest the plaintiff's demand, Delaware did but follow familiar precedents and analogies, besides conforming to the custom. It is not contended that the substitution, by the 1877 amendment, of a bond conditioned for payment of the judgment to the extent of the value of the property attached, in lieu of the special bail formerly required on entering appearance, made a substantial difference rendering the new requirement any more obnoxious to the due process clause than the earlier. It is the imposing of any condition whatever upon the right to be heard that is complained of.\n Hence the question is whether the state in thus adopting a time- honored method of procedure and preserving as a part of it a time-honored requirement of security, and in adhering logically to the ancient distinction between a proceeding quasi in rem and an action in personam, to the extent of refraining, until the amendment of 1917, from enacting legislation recognizing the peculiar appeal \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 109]\n\u00a0\n of a defendant who may have no resources or credit aside from the property attached, must be regarded as having deprived such a defendant of his property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. In our opinion, the question must be answered in the negative.\n In Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Imp. Co., 18 How. 272, 276, 280, which arose under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the court, by Mr. Justice Curtis, declared (18 How. 276, 277):\n'The Constitution contains no description of those processes which it was intended to allow or forbid. It does not even declare what principles are to be applied to ascertain whether it be due process . ... To what principles, then, are we to resort to ascertain whether this process, enacted by Congress, is due process? To this the answer must be twofold. We must examine the Constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions. If not found to be so, we must look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country.'\n\n In Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 722-724 24 L. Ed. 565, it was shown that the process of foreign attachment has its fundamental basis in the exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty of each state over persons and property within its borders; and although emphasis was there laid upon the authority and duty of a state to protect its own citizens in their claims against nonresident owners of property situate within the state, it is clear that, by virtue of the 'privileges and immunities' clause of section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution, each state is at liberty, if not under a duty, to accord the same privilege of protection to creditors \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 110]\n\u00a0\n who are citizens of other states that it accords to its own citizens. Blake v. McClung, \n172 U.S. 239\n, 248 et seq., 19 Sup. Ct. 165.\n The record before us shows no judgment entered against plaintiff in error in personam, but only one for carrying into effect a lien imposed upon his interest in property within the jurisdiction of the state for the purpose of satisfying a demand made against him as a nonresident debtor, and established to the satisfaction of the court. And an analysis of his contentions shows that the real complaint was and is, not that there was any departure, arbitrary or otherise, from the due and orderly course of procedure provided by the statutes of Delaware long before the case arose, but rather that the courts of the state declined to recognize the peculiar hardship of his case as sufficient ground for relaxing in his behalf the established legal procedure. His appeal in effect was to the summary and equitable jurisdiction of a court of law so to control its own process and proceedings as not to produce hardship. This is a recognized extraordinary jurisdiction of common-law courts, distinguishable from their ordinary or formal jurisdiction. It has been much developed since the separation of the American colonies from England. But where the proceedings have been regular, it is exercised as a matter of grace or discretion, not as of right, and is characterized by the imposition of terms on the party to whom concession is made. Smith's Action at Law (4th Ed. 1851) pp. 22-27; Stewart's Blackstone (1854) vol. 3, pp. 334-338. A liberal exercise of this summary and equitable jurisdiction, in the interest of substantial justice and in relaxation of the rigors of strict legal practice, is to be commended; but it cannot be said to be essential to due process of law, in the constitutional sense.\n The due process clause does not impose upon the states a duty to establish ideal systems for the administration of justice, with every modern improvement and with \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 111]\n\u00a0\n provision against every possible hardship that may befall. It restrains state action, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, within bounds that are consistent with the fundamentals of individual liberty and private property, including the right to be heard where liberty or property is at stake in judicial proceedings. But a property owner who absents himself from the territorial jurisdiction of a state, leaving his property within it, must be deemed ex necessitate to consent that the state may subject such property to judicial process to answer demands made against him in his absence, according to any practicable method that reasonably may be adopted. A procedure customarily employed, long before the Revolution, in the commercial metropolis of England, and generally adopted by the states as suited to their circumstances and needs, cannot be deemed inconsistent with due process of law, even if it be taken with its ancient incident of requiring security from a defendant who after seizure of his property comes within the jurisdiction and seeks to interpose a defense. The condition imposed has a reasonable relation to the conversion of a proceeding quasi in rem into an action in personam; ordinarily it is not difficult to comply with-a man who has property usually has friends and credit-and hence in its normal operation it must be regarded as a permissible condition; and it cannot be deemed so arbitrary as to render the procedure inconsistent with due process of law when applied to a defendant who, through exceptional misfortune, is unable to furnish the necessary security; certainly not where such defendant, as is the case now presented, so far as the record shows, has acquired the property right and absented himself from the state after the practice was established, and hence with notice that his property situate there would be subject to disposition under foreign attachment by the very method that afterwards was pursued, and that he would have no right to \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 112]\n\u00a0\n enter appearance and make defense except upon giving security.\n However desirable it is that the old forms of procedure be improved with the progress of time, it cannot rightly be said that the Fourteenth Amendment furnishes a universal and self-executing remedy. Its function is negative, to affirmative, and it carries no mandate for particular measures of reform. For instance, it does not constrain the states to accept particular modern doctrines of equity, or adopt a combined system of law and equity procedure, or dispense with all necessity for form and method in pleading, or give untrammeled liberty to make amendments. Neither does it, as we think, require a state to relieve the hardship of an ancient and familiar method of procedure by dispensing with the exaction of special security from an appearing defendant in foreign attachment.\n We conclude that the statutes under consideration were not in conflict with the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Under the equal protection clause it is contended that there is unwarranted discrimination in debarring an individual from appearing and making defense without first giving special security, while a foreign corporation may appear and answer without giving any security, except for the lien of the process upon the property attached. But, as we have seen, the difference in treatment was resorted to because from their nature corporations could not put special bail or be surrendered thereunder. This was a reasonable ground for separating defendants into two classes- individuals and corporations; and it was natural that in subsequent legislation the classes should be separately treated, as was done. There is here no denial of the equal protection of the laws, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The objection that the acts abridge the privileges and \n\n[256 U.S. 94, 113]\n\u00a0\n immunities of citizens of the United States, within the meaning of the same amendment, is not pressed, and plainly is untenable. As has been pointed our repeatedly, the privileges and immunities referred to in the amendment are only such as owe their existence to the federal government, its national character, its Constitution, or its laws.

CO. v. PIGOTT(1921)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Frank Feuille, of Ancon, Canal Zone, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Theodore C. Hinckley, of Panama, Republic of Panama, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in the District Court of the Canal Zone for the Division of Cristobal to recover from the Panama Railroad Company for personal injuries suffered by the minor, Pigott, in the City of Colon, Republic \n\n[254 U.S. 552, 553]\n\u00a0\n of Panama. Pigott recovered a judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 256 Fed. 837, 168 C. C. A. 183. The case is brought to this Court under the Panama Canal Act, August 24, 1912, c. 390,  9; 37 Stat. 560, 566 (Comp. St.  10045). The facts may be stated in a few words. The minor, a boy of seven, was run over when attempting to cross the railroad track on a street in Colon. There was evidence that the crossing was much used and that especially in the afternoon, the time of the accident, there usually were many children about; there were however, neither gates nor a watchman at the place. A hedge higher than the child somewhat obstructed the view. The engine was backing a box car and did not have the lookout required by the company's rules. There was evidence also that it gave no warning by bell or whistle. In short by the criteria of the common law the plaintiff had a right to go to the jury with his case.\n The fundamental argument for the plaintiff in error is that the law of Panama was not applied in determining the principles of liability or in fixing the rule of damages. It is contended that if, as there was evidence to prove, due care had been used in the selection of servants by the railroad, the company was not answerable for their negligence, and that in any event there could be no recovery for pain. Both of these contentions are simply attempts to reargue what was decided in Panama Railroad Co. v. Toppin, \n252 U.S. 308\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 319. The plaintiff in error certainly did not get less than it was entitled to when, in view of contradictory testimony from lawyers on the two sides, the Court left the law of Panama to the jury. The Court was warranted in also leaving to the jury the question whether proper care required the company to have a flagman or gate at the crossing and the other safeguards that we have mentioned. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Ives, \n144 U.S. 408\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 679. In view of the extreme youth of the plaintiff we cannot say that the Court erred in allowing the jury \n\n[254 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n to attribute his misfortune to the defendant's conduct alone, whatever difficulties there might be in the case of an older person; and we perceive no other ground for not allowing the verdict and the decision of the two Courts below to stand.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAYNE v.

The trial court dismissed the bill, and the Court of Appeals reversed that decree and directed that an injunction issue. Central Pac. Ry. Co. v. Lane, 46 App. D. C. 374, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 1002. An appeal under section 250, par. 6, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227) brings the case here. \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n The allegations of the bill were admitted by a motion to dismiss, upon which the defendants announced their purpose to stand; and the case as thus made is as follows:\n By the Act of July 25, 1866, c. 242, 14 Stat. 239, a grant of public lands in California and Oregon was made 'for the purpose of aiding in the construction' of a line of railroad from a point in Sacramento Valley to Portland, 'and to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war and public stores' over such line. The part of the grant in California was made to the California and Oregon Railroad Company, its successors and assigns, and the part in Oregon to another company. The grant was in present terms-'there be, and hereby is, granted'- and was of 'every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers,' within designated limits on each side of the line. With this was coupled a provision that--\n'When any of said alternate section or parts of sections shall be found to have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of, other lands, designated as aforesaid, shall be selected by said companies in lieu thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate sections designated by odd numbers as aforesaid, nearest to and not more than ten miles beyond the limits of said first-named alternate sections.'\n\n The line of the road was to be definitely located by filing a map with the Secretary of the Interior; and the work of construction was to be completed in sections of twenty miles within a time named, which was extended to July 1, 1880, by an amendment of June 25, 1868. 15 Stat. 80, c. 80. The completion of each section was to be ascertained and reported by commissioners appointed by the President, whereupon patents for the lands coterminous therewith were to be issued. The railroad was to be and remain 'a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free of all toll or other charges' for the transportation of \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n its property or troops. An assent to the act on the part of each grantee was to be filed within one year after its passage.\n The California and Oregon Railroad Company duly assented to the act, definitely located its part of the line by filing the required map, and constructed, completed and equipped that part of the railroad within the extended time. The completion was duly reported by the commissioners and was recognized by the President. In addition, that company and its successors have complied with the act in all other respects. The Central Pacific Railway Company, the plaintiff, became the legal successor of that company in 1899, and holds its rights, title and interest under the grant. The part of the road in Oregon also was completed, but that is not of present concern.\n In the process of adjusting the grant it has developed that many of the designated sections in the place limits were lost to the grant by reason of other disposals, homestead settlements and pre-emption claims antedating the definite location of the line of the road, thereby making it necessary to resort to the indemnity limits to satisfy the grant. The present ascertained losses amount to thousands of acres, and it is certain that further substantial losses will develop as the adjustment proceeds. As yet it is impossible to determine even approximately the total losses, because a material part of the grant is still unsurveyed; and this makes it uncertain whether all can be made good from the lands available for indemnity.\n The lands in question were selected by means of an indemnity list filed in the local land office February 24, 1910, and the selection was in lieu of losses specified in the list which were actual and entitled the plaintiff to indemnity. The lands selected are in the indemnity limits and admittedly nonmineral, and at the time of selection were such as could be selected to supply the losses specified. The list was accompanied by the requisite sustaining proofs \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n and conformed in all respects to the regulations embodying the directions of the Secretary of the Interior upon the subject. The plaintiff paid the fees collectible thereon, and the local land officers approved the list and promptly forwarded it and the accompanying proofs to the General Land Office with the usual certificates and indorsements. It remained pending in that office until January 16, 1915, when the Commissioner ordered its cancellation solely on the ground that in the meantime the selected lands had been included in a temporary executive withdrawal for a water power site under the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (Comp. St.  4523-4525). The plaintiff appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, and he affirmed the Commissioner's action. A reconsideration was sought and denied, and the plaintiff then brought this suit.\n It is not questioned that, had the selection been reached for consideration before the withdrawal, it would have been the duty of the Commissioner and the Secretary to approve it and pass the lands to patent; nor that, if the withdrawal be not an obstacle, it still is their duty to do so. But it is insisted that so long as the selection was without the Secretary's actual approval it gave no right as against the government, and that the withdrawal made while it was as yet unapproved became a legal obstacle to its approval. In this there is an obvious misconception of the office and effect of the selection, and the misconception is particularly shown in the brief for the appellants, where the selection is treated as only a preliminary land application or filing. Counsel there say:\n'What is the effect then of the mere filing of an indemnity selection? Its only effect, we submit, is to give the selector a preference right to the land as against one tendering a filing thereafter.'\n\n Rightly speaking, the selection is not to be likened to the initial step of one who wishes to obtain the title to public land by future compliance with the law, but rather \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n to the concluding step of one who by full compliance has earned the right to receive the title. Referring to a similar grant and the relative obligations of the government and the grantee, it was said in Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 679\n, 680 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 907, 911 ( 58 L. Ed. 1527):\n'The act did not follow the building of the road, but preceded it. Instead of giving a gratuitous reward for something already done, the act made a proposal to the company to the effect that if the latter would locate, construct and put into operation a designated line of railroad, patents would be issued to the company confirming in it the right and title to the public lands falling within the descriptive terms of the grant. The purpose was to bring about the construction of the road, with the resulting advantages to the government and the public, and to that end provision was made for compensating the company, if it should do the work, by patenting to it the lands indicated. The company was at liberty to accept or reject the proposal. It accepted in the mode contemplated by the act, and thereby the parties were brought into such contractual relations that the terms of the proposal became obligatory on both. Menotti v. Dillon, \n167 U.S. 703\n, 721. And when, by constructing the road and putting it in operation, the company performed its part of the contract, it became entitled to performance by the government. In other words, it earned the right to the lands described.'\n\n And, speaking specially of the right to indemnity lands under such a grant, it was said in United States v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 565, 570\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 326, 327 (56 L. Ed. 553):\n'What a railroad is to be indemnified for may be fixed as of the moment of the grant, but what it may elect when its right to indemnity is determined depends on the state of the lands selected at the moment of choice. Of course the railroad is limited in choosing by the terms of the indemnity grant, but the so-called grant is rather to be described as a power. Ordinarily no color of title is gained until the power is exercised. When it is exercised in satisfaction of \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 236]\n\u00a0\n a meritorious claim which the government created upon valuable consideration and which it must be taken to have intended to satisfy ( so far as it may be satisfied within the territorial limits laid down ), it seems to us that lands within those limits should not be excluded simply because in a different event they would have been subject to a paramount claim.'\n\n The ultimate obligation of the government in respect of the indemnity lands is on the same plane as that respecting the lands in place. The only difference is in the mode of identification. Those in place are identified by filing the map of definite location, and the indemnity lands by selections made in lieu of losses in the place limits. St. Paul & Sioux City R. R. Co. v. Winona & St. Peter R. R. Co., \n112 U.S. 720\n, 731-733, 5 Sup. Ct. 334; Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Bell, \n183 \nU.S. 675, 687\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 232. The selections are to be made by the grantee, not be the Secretary of the Interior. True, the act provides that they shall be made under the Secretary's direction, but this merely applies to them the general rule, announced in Rev. Stat.  441, 453, 2478 (Comp. St.  681, 699, 5120), that the administrative execution of all public land laws is to be under his 'supervision' and 'direction.' Catholic Bishop of Nesqually v. Gibbson, \n158 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 779. Its purpose is to make sure that, in accord with that power of supervision and direction, he is to see to it that the right of selection is not abused, that claims arising out of prior settlement and the like are not disturbed, that no indemnity is given except for actual losses of the class intended, and that the lands selected are such as are subject to selection. But of course it does not clothe him with any discretion to enlarge or curtail the rights of the grantee, nor to substitute his judgment for the will of Congress as manifested in the granting act. Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 \nU.S. 456, 461\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 122; Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 635; Williams v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 514, 524\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 457; Daniels v. Wagner, \n237 U.S. 547\n, 557-561, 35 Sup. Ct. 740, L. R. A. 1916A, 1116, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 40; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. McComas, \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 237]\n\u00a0\n \n250 U.S. 387\n, 392-393, 39 SUP. Ct. 546, 63 L. ED. 1049. THE CASES CIted aS making for a different conclusion respecting the Secretary's discretion were examined, and that view of them rejected in Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n269 \nU.S. 380, 388\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 300, and Daniels v. Wagner, \n237 U.S. 547\n, 557-561, 35 Sup. Ct. 740, L. R. A. 1916A, 1116, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 40. In the Weyerhaeuser Case it was held that the authority conferred on the Secretary respecting the selection of indemnity lands 'involved not only the power but implied the duty to determine the lawfulness of the selections as of the time when the exertion of the authority was invoked by the lawful filling of the list of selections.'\n As before shown, this indemnity selection was made in full compliance with the directions promulgated by the Secretary, was of lands subject to selection, and was based on actual losses in the place limits adequate to sustain it. The railroad then had been constructed and equipped as required by the granting act, and nothing remained to be done by the grantee or its successor to fulfill the conditions of the grant and perfect the right to a patent. The rule applicable in such a situation is that--\n'A person who complies with all the requisites necessary to entitle him to a patent in a particular lot or tract is to be regarded as the equitable owner thereof.' Wirth v. Branson, \n98 U.S. 118\n, 121 (25 L. Ed. 86), Benson Mining Co. v. Alta Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 428, 432\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 877.\n\n This rule has been applied and enforced where the Secretary through an error of law declined to approve and give effect to lawful selections and certified the lands for the use of another claimant, the court saying that the Secretary could not thus deprive the selecting company of 'rights which became vested by its selection of those lands.' St. Paul & Sioux City R. R. Co. v. Winona & St. Peter R. R. Co., \n112 U.S. 720\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 334.\n The act under which the subsequent power site withdrawal was made is confined to 'public lands,' a term uniformly regarded as not including lands to which rights have attached and become vested through full compliance \n\n[255 U.S. 228, 238]\n\u00a0\n with an applicable land law. Newhall v. Sanger, \n92 U.S. 761\n, 763; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 391\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 650; United States v. Hemmer, \n241 \nU.S. 379, 385\n, 386 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 659. Besides, to apply the act to the lands in question, lawfully earned and selected as they were, would work such an interference with private rights as plainly to require that it be construed as not including them. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; Lytle v. Arkansas, 9 How. 314, 333, 335; Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 718\n, 719 S.; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 400\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854.\n We are asked to say that this is a suit against the United States, and therefore not maintainable without its consent, but we think the suit is one to restrain the appellants from canceling a valid indemnity selection through a mistaken conception of their authority, and thereby casting a cloud on the plaintiff's title. Ballinger v. Frost, \n216 U.S. 240\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 338; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 619\n, 620 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 340; Lane v. Watts, \n234 \nU.S. 525, 540\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 965\n\n\n Our conclusion is that in giving effect to the withdrawal as against the prior selection, which admittedly was valid when made, the appellants departed from a plain official duty, and that to avoid the resulting injury to the plaintiff, for which no other remedy is available, an injunction should issue, directing a disposal of the selection on its merits unaffected by the withdrawal. Such an injunction, we think, is better suited to the occasion than that indicated by Court of Appeals. In other respects the decree of that court is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAYNE v.

A hearing on the bill and answer resulted in a decree for the state, which the Court of Appeals affirmed ( Lane v. State of New Mexico, 258 Fed. 980, 49 App. D. C. 80), and the defendants appealed to this court. \n\n[255 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n There was no controversy or difference in the Land Department about any question of fact, but only in respect of the time as of which the officers were authorized and required to determine the validity of the selection.\n Congress granted to New Mexico for the support of common schools designated sections of land in each township, subject to specified exceptions, with a provision enabling and entitling the state to select other lands in lieu of those excepted, and with a further provision whereby, in the event any of the designated sections after passing under the grant should be included within a public reservation, the state was to be entitled to waive its right to them and select instead other land of equal acreage. See California v. Deseret Water, etc., Co., \n243 U.S. 415\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 394. All lieu lands were to be selected 'under the direction and subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.' Act June 21, 1898, c. 489,  1, 8, 30 Stat. 484; Act March 16, 1908, c. 88, 35 Stat. 44 (Comp.

St.  4860, 4861).\n Some of the tracts in place after passing under the grant were included within a public reservation called the Alamo National Forest. Afterwards, on March 9, 1915, the state filed in the local land office a selection list waiving its rights to one of these tracts and selecting in its stead other land of like area lawfully subject to selection. The list conformed to the directions given by the Secretary of the Interior and was accompanied by the requisite proofs and the proper fees. Notice of the selection was duly posted and published, proof of publication was submitted and the publisher's charge was paid. In other words, the waiver and selection were regularly presented and all was done by the state that needed to be done by it to perfect the selection. The notice did not bring forth any protest or objection, and in due course the local land officers forwarded the list and supporting proofs and papers to the General \n\n[255 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n Land Office, with a certificate stating that there was no adverse filing, entry or claim to the land selected and that the list had been accepted and approved by them. The list remained pending in that office until May 16, 1916, when the Commissioner directed that the selection be canceled solely on the ground that in the meantime, on April 3, 1916, the base tract-the one right to which was waived-had been eliminated from the reservation by a change in its boundaries. The state appealed to the Secretary of the Interior and he affirmed the Commissioner's action. Both officers proceeded on the theory that the validity of the selection was to be tested by the conditions existing when they came to examine it and not by those existing when the state made it-in other words, they conceived that although the selection was lawful when made they could and should disapprove it and direct its cancellation by reason of the elimination of the base tract from the reservation a year later.\n The courts below rejected that view and held that those officers were required to give effect to the conditions existing when the selection was made and that, if it was valid then, they were not at liberty to disapprove or cancel it by reason of the subsequent change in the status of the base tract. In our opinion the courts were right. The provision under which the selection was made was one inviting and proposing an exchange of lands. By it Congress said in substance to the state: If you will waive or surrender your titled tract in the reservation, you may select and take in lieu of it a tract of like area from the unappropriated nonmineral public lands outside the reservation. Acceptance of such a proposal and compliance with its terms confer a vested right in the selected land which the land officers cannot lawfully cancel or disregard. In this respect the provision under which the state proceeded does not differ from other land laws which offer a conveyance of the title to those who accept and fully comply with their terms. \n\n[255 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n In the brief for the officers it is frankly and rightly conceded to be well settled that 'a claimant to public land who has done all that is required under the law to perfect his claim acquires rights against the government and that his right to a legal title is to be determined as of that time,' and also that this rule 'is based upon the theory that by virtue of his compliance with the requirements he has an equitable title to the land; that in equity it is his and the government holds it in trust for him.' See Lytle v. Arkansas, 9 How. 314, 333; Stark v. Starr, 6 Wall. 402, 417, 418; Ard v. Brandon, \n156 \nU.S. 537, 543\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 406; Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 U.S. 228\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 314, 65 L. Ed. --. But it is said that, as the selection is 'subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior,' no right can become vested, nor equitable title be acquired, thereunder, unless and until his approval is had, and therefore that the rule just stated is not applicable here. To this we cannot assent. The words relied upon are not peculiar to this land grant, but are found in many others. Their purpose is to cast upon the Secretary the duty of ascertaining whether the selector is acting within the law, in respect of both the land relinquished and the land selected, and of approving or rejecting the selection accordingly. The power conferred is 'judicial in its nature' and not only involves the authority, but implies the duty, 'to determine the lawfulness of the selections as of the time when the exertion of the authority was invoked by the lawful filing of the list of selections.' Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 388\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 300; Daniels v. Wagner, \n237 U.S. 547\n, 557 et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 740, L. R. A. 1916A, 1116, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 40; Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., supra. This view of it has been enforced where the Secretary, misconceiving his authority and the rithts of the selector, erroneously declined to approve and canceled selections lawfully made. St. Paul & Sioux City R. R. Co. v. Winona & St. Peter R. R. Co., \n112 U.S. 720\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 334; Daniels v. Wagner, supra. And it should be observed that this view has been recognized and applied by the Land Department, although not \n\n[255 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n with uniformity. In the Case of Gideon v. McDonald, 30 Land Dec. 124, which involved a lieu land selection and a state of facts much like those now before us, it was said by the Secretary of the Interior:\n'When the selection was filed the land embraced in the accompanying deed of relinquishment and reconveyance was within the limits of the forest reserve and a proper basis for a selection under said act, and the land selected by McDonald in exchange was, according to the records of your [Commissioner's] office, of the character subject to such selection and free from other claim or appropriation. By this deed of relinquishment and reconveyance to the United States of his own land situate within the boundaries of the forest reserve, and by his selection of the lieu land, McDonald accepted the standing offer or proposal of the government contained in the act of June 4, 1897 [ 30 Stat. 36], and complied with its conditions, thereby converting the mere offer or proposal of the government into a contract fully executed upon his part, and in the execution of which by the government he had a vested right. After McDonald had fully complied with the terms on which the government by said act had declared its willingness to be bound, no act of either the executive or legislative branch of the government could divest him of the right thereby acquired. Your [Commissioner's] office will therefore carefully examine the papers and records pertaining to this selection and, if it is found to be otherwise free from objection, the fact of the elimination from the boundaries of the forest reserve of the lands in lieu of which the selection is made, after full compliance by the claimant with the lieu land act and regulations, will not prevent approval of the selection.'\n\n In California v. Deseret Water, etc., Co., supra, which involved a like waiver and selection alleged to have been lawfully made and to be awaiting action by the Secretary, the United States, in a brief presented by leave of the court, took the position that by the waiver it acquired such an \n\n[255 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n equitable right in the base tract as prevented a condemnation of the tract as the property of the state. The state court held the waiver and selection of no effect and this court reversed that decision.\n We conclude that an injunction was rightly awarded, but that it will be better suited to the occasion if it be confined to directing a disposal of the selection in regular course unaffected by the elimination of the base tract from the reservation. With this modification the decree is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAYNE v. U S EX REL NEWTON(1921)\nNo. 123\nArgued: December 16, 1920Decided: March 14, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 438, 439]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnett, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. W. Clements and Alex. Britton, both of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a petition to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus commanding the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office to pass a homestead entry to patent. A demurrer to the answer was sustained, the defendants elected to stand on the answer, and a judgment awarding the writ was entered. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (Lane v. United States ex rel. Newton, 48 App. D. C. 547), and the defendants prosecute this writ of error under section 250, cl. 6, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227).\n The important statute, the construction of which is drawn in question by the defendants, is a provision in section 7 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099 (Comp. St.  5113), which declares: \n\n[255 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n 'That after the lapse of two years from the date of the issuance of the receiver's receipt upon the final entry of any tract of land under the homestead, timber culture, desert land, or preemption laws, or under this act, and when there shall be no pending contest or protest against the validity of such entry, the entryman shall be entitled to a patent conveying the land by him entered, and the same shall be issued to him.'\n The facts which stand admitted can be shortly stated. Allen L. Newton, the relator, made a preliminary homestead entry at the local land office of a quarter section of land. At that time the land was withdrawn for forest purposes, but with the qualification that prior homestead settlers who continued in good faith to maintain their claims should be permitted to carry them to entry and patent. Newton claimed to be a prior settler and within the qualification. In due course, after publication of the regular notice, he submitted commutation proofs under the homestead law and paid the purchase price and the legal fees. The local land officers found the proofs satisfactory, permitted him to make final entry and issued thereon the usual receiver's receipt. That was on November 21, 1904, and there was no protest, contest or other proceeding against the entry within two years, nor until November 27, 1908. On the latter date the Commissioner of the General Land Office ordered a hearing upon a charge that Newton had not complied with the law in point of residence and cultivation; and on March 23, 1912, the Secretary of the Interior held in that proceeding that the charge was sustained and ordered the entry canceled. On May 14, 1918, the Secretary rescinded that order and directed that the entry be passed to patent under the statute before quoted. The following month the Secretary recalled his last action and caused a suit to be brought in the District Court of the district wherein the land is situate to cancel the receiver's receipt and quiet the title \n\n[255 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n in the United States. The bill in that suit charged that the entry was fraudulently procured in that the proofs submitted by Mewton in respect of his settlement, residence and cultivation were false; and that charge is repeated in the answer in the present case. Further proceedings in the suit in the District Court have been suspended, it is said, to await the ultimate decision on this petition.\n Both courts below held that, as the final entry was not questioned by any protest or contest in the Land Department within two years after the issue of the receiver's receipt, the statute-the provision in section 7- terminated the authority of that department to entertain any proceeding for the cancellation of the entry, and cast upon the Secretary and the Commissioner a plain and unqualified duty to pass the entry to patent. Whether that ruling was right or otherwise is the matter we are to consider.\n The words of the statute are direct and make it very plain that if at the expiration of two years from the date of the receiver's receipt on final entry there is 'no pending contest or protest' against the entry its validity no longer may be called in question in the Land Department-that is to say, 'the entryman shall be entitled to a patent ... and the same shall be issued to him.' The purpose to fix his right and to command its recognition is obvious. This court so held in Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 U.S. 174\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 558, where a writ of mandamus directing the issue of a patent was awarded. In that case, as in this, there was no contest or protest within the designated period, and in a proceeding subsequently initiated the Secretary held that the entryman had not complied with the law in point of residence and cultivation-in other words, that the proofs by which he procured the entry were false-and upon that ground the cancellation of the entry was directed. Besides, the entry there bore the same relation to a forest reserve that the present entry bears. Thus in all that is material the \n\n[255 U.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n two cases are alike. In the opinion in that case it was pointed out that the practice of the Land Department prior to the statute had been to entertain and act upon belated suggestions of fraud and noncompliance with law, that this had resulted in a practical blockade in the issue of patents, and that the purpose of the statute was to rectify that situation and prevent its recurrence. The court then observed (page 181):\n'In the exercise of its discretion Congress has said, in substance, by this statute that for two years after the entryman submits final proof and obtains the receiver's receipt the entry may be held open for the initiation of proceedings to test its validity, but that if none such be begun within that time it shall be passed to patent as a matter of course.'\n\n In the main the Land Department, as its regulations and decisions show, has construed and applied the statute as taking from the land officers all power to entertain proceedings for the cancellation of final entries of the classes specified, save where the proceeding is begun within the two-year period-and this whether it is initiated by a government officer or by a private individual, and whether it is based upon a charge of fraud or upon some other ground. To illustrate: In the original instructions of May 8, 1891, 12 Land Dec. 450, the department took the position that it no longer could cancel such an entry or withhold the patent 'on the ground of fraud, a failure to comply with the law, or a prior claim,' unless a proceeding for the purpose was initiated within the period prescribed. In the case of Jacob A. Harris, 42 Land Dec. 611, decided December 13, 1913, the Secretary of the Interior adhered to that position as grounded upon a 'sound construction of the law,' overruled a decision to the contrary made two years before and rejected a protest presented after the alloted time, which charged that the entryman, contrary to the statements in his proofs, had not complied with the law in the matter of settlement, residence and cultivation. \n\n[255 U.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n And in instructions issued April 25, 1914, 43 Land Dec. 294, the Secretary stated that the lapse of two years after the issue of the receiver's receipt 'will bar a contest or protest based upon any charge whatsoever,' save where the proceeding is sustained by some special statutory provision.\n The defendants now call that construction in question. But we perceive no reason for rejecting or disturbing it. On the contrary, we think it is in accord with the natural import of the words of the statute and gives effect to the evident purpose of Congress. That purpose is to require that the right to a patent which for two years has been evidenced by a receiver's receipt, and at the end of that period stands unchallenged, shall be recognized and given effect by the issue of the patent without further waiting or delay-and thus to transfer from the land officers to the regular judicial tribunals the authority to deal with any subsequent controversy over the validity of the entry, as would be the case if the patent were issued in the absence of the statute. See Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 \nU.S. 473, 477\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 485. Of course, the purpose is not merely to enable the officers to issue the patent-for which they have other express authority-but to command them to issue it in the event stated; the words of the statute being 'the entryman shall be entitled to a patent conveying the land by him entered, and the same shall be issued to him.'\n It is urged that the pendency in the District Court of the suit before mentioned affords a sufficient justification for withholding the patent. The courts below held otherwise, and rightly so, as we think. The statute contemplates that in the event stated the patent shall not longer be withheld, but shall be issued promptly to the end that the entryman shall have the advantages and protection which go with it. In other words, it is intended that he shall be clothed with the legal title instead of an equitable title only, shall have a patent instead of a receiver's receipt, and \n\n[255 U.S. 438, 445]\n\u00a0\n shall have the benefit of the presumptions which are available to other patentees when their rights are called in question. But for this the statute would be without any real purpose or effect.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R. CO. v. WEBER(1921)\nNo. 210\nArgued: October 13, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Wolf Bikle and Francis I. Gowen, both of Philadelphia, Pa., and Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. A. Glasgow, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause has been the subject of much and long continued controversy. This is its third appearance in this court. The previous history of the litigation is set out in \n242 U.S. 89\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 49. The action is based upon a reparation order made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in favor of Jacoby & Co. A recovery was had in the sum awarded by the Commission, with interest. At the first trial plaintiffs did not introduce the record of the testimony before the Commission. The defendant railroad company introduced testimony tending to show that the Commission in making its award of damages had used a table, attached as Exhibit 10 to the record of the case, showing a discrimination of the railroad company against the plaintiffs in the distribution of coal cars in times of shortage, and produced a witness who testified that the effect of the use of the percentages in that table as the basis of awarding damaes by the Commission was to give plaintiffs the undue preference in the distribution of coal cars which favored shippers had received. That being so, this court held that the recovery of a sum thus arrived at would defeat the purpose of the act to place shippers on a basis of equality. For the refusal of the trial court to give a charge based upon such use of the table the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, affirming that of the District Court, was reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial. The second trial in the District Court resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum awarded by the Commission with interest. Weber v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 263 Fed. 945. That judgment was affirmed \n\n[257 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n by the Circuit Court of Appeals (269 Fed. 111), and the case is again here.\n We need not repeat the discussion concerning distribution of cars in times of shortage which was held to result in undue advantage. See 242 U. S. supra, at pages 90, 91, 37 Sup. Ct. 49; Hillsdale Coal & Coke Co. v. P. R. R. Co., 19 Interst. Com. Com'n, 362, 363, 364.\n At the last trial the testimony before the Commission was put in evidence, with some additional testimony tending to show that plaintiffs had been discriminated against because of the special allotment to the Berwind-White Company of 500 cars daily, and the sale to it, and to other companies, of a large number of cars in times of car shortage. There was evidence tending to show that but for these discriminations the plaintiffs would have received a sufficient number of cars to furnish them with all they needed during the periods complained of.\n The Commission in the report condemned the practice of giving to the Berwind-White Coal Company 500 cars daily by special allotment, and the selling of the company's own cars during the same period to favored shippers, thereby diminishing its capacity to supply the coal car requirements of other coal companies along its line.\n When the Commission came to assess damages, it allowed the plaintiffs $ 21,094.35, with interest from January 28, 1907. The order on which this award was made is set forth in 242 U. S., supra. Upon the new trial, with the additional testimony and the whole record of the Commission introduced in evidence, the judge, after charging the jury that there might be a recovery, if the discriminations alleged and proved resulted in damages in the sum awarded by the Commission, charged:\n'If you should find that the conclusion of the Interstate Commerce Commission that the plaintiff in the year ending April 1, 1905, should have received cars equal in \n\n[257 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n capacity to 59.9 per cent. of the aggregate of their mine's daily rating, and in the period between April 1 and October 18, 1905, cars equal in capacity to 59.6 per cent. of the aggregate of their mine's daily rating-if you should find that that conclusion was reached or arrived at because of the evidence presented by the plaintiff that the aggregate of the cars placed by the defendant at certain mines which had been selected for the purpose of comparison from those comprised in the region in which the plaintiff's mine was located, had been equal in the earlier period to 59.9 per cent. and in the later period to 59.6 per cent. of the aggregate ratings of these selected mines [these being the percentages of cars given to preferred companies as shown in Exhibit 10] for the basis of the Commission's conclusion, then the award was an erroneous one, and under those circumstances the finding of the Commission would lose its effect as prima facie evidence, and you would only be justified in finding for the plaintiff if you find that from the other evidence offered before the Commission, either of discrimination through distribution to favored shippers in the Tyrone region, or through withholding cars from the Tyrone region, which should have been distributed there, the Commission was justified in arriving at that conclusion. If you find that the Commission was justified in arriving at that conclusion, or are satisfied from that evidence, and that evidence is reinforced by further evidence that the plaintiff has offered in the case, then you would be justified in finding a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and assessing damages at the amount found by the Commission.\n\n'If, however, you should find that that was an erroneous finding, then it would be your duty to find to what extent the plaintiff was damaged, I mean in case you find that the plaintiff was actually damaged you would have to find to what extent the plaintiff was actually damaged. If you leave out the evidence before the Commission the \n\n[257 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n court is unable to say that there is any other evidence standing alone which would be sufficient, but the evidence which was before the Commission has all been offered before you and some additional testimony. The proper basis of damages in that case, if the Commission has not reached the proper basis, would be upon the theory set out in the Commission's report, but not based on a comparison between what the favored shippers received and what the plaintiff received.\n\n'If the plaintiff is entitled to recover and has suffered damages, the measure of damages would be the loss in operating, upon the coal that was actually shipped through discrimination in favor of other shippers, together with the profits it would have made on the coal they would have been able to ship. The question as to what coal they would have been able to ship is a question for you gentlemen to decide under the evidence in this case. You have had the schedules laid before you, counsel have argued the case to you and explained the grounds on which they respectively base their demand on the one side and the defense on the other, and the questions of fact are for your determination. The defendant has offered in evidence, and has shown you these facts, in regard to the 59.9 per cent. and the 59.6 per cent., and as I have already instructed you, if you find the Commission's finding was based on that then the Commission's finding as to the amount of damages suffered should not be considered by the jury, but the jury will be obliged independ ently, if they can do so, to arrive at a proper amount of damages.\n\n'If the jury do not believe that the plaintiff suffered any damages or do not believe that they were discriminated against in favor of other shippers, either by the distribution of cars that were sent into this region or by the failure of the railroad company to send cars to the Tyrone region which should have been distributed there, then it \n\n[257 U.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n would be your duty to find a verdict in favor of the defendant.'\n\n As there was substantial testimony in the record to support the finding of the Commission in awarding damages in a sum at least equal to the amount assessed by it, the principal question to be decided is: May a plaintiff recover in such circumstances in a sutt based upon a reparation order of the Interstate Commerce Commission when there is testimony fairly tending to show that recovery was justified because of unfair practices in the distribution of coal cars in times of shortage, which practices, as its report shows, were condemned by the Commission, although it may appear that the sum awarded by the Commission was actually based upon an erroneous calculation?\n In determining the rule to govern this situation we must bear in mind that the Commission is empowered to act upon questions of unfair practices and discrimination. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Clark Co., \n238 U.S. 456\n, and the previous cases in this court, cited at page 469, 35 Sup. Ct. 896. While this is true, when an action is brought upon a reparation order of the Commission as it may be under section 16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8584) its findings and order are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n236 U.S. 412\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691; Second Meeker Case, \n236 U.S. 434\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 337; Mills v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n238 U.S. 473\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 888. These cases have disposed of the question of the right of the defendant to attack the prima facie value of the award, and have dealt with the nature of the award of the Commission in view of the statutory provisions as to its character.\n That the Commission used a wrong basis in awarding damages, now that the whole record is before us, admits of no doubt. Indeed, the coincidence in the award made and the use of the percentage table shown in Exhibit No. 10 is difficult to account for except upon the basis pointed \n\n[257 U.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n out by the witness introduced by the defendant, whose testimony was made the basis of the request to charge, the refusal of which led to the reversal of the judgment in 242 U. S. supra.\n The defendant in error argues that the Commission could not have used this table because it covers a different period of operation as evidenced by the number of days shown than the Commission found to have been the period covered by the operation of the plaintiff's mine. Nevertheless, the coincidence of percentage and award remains, and the conclusion is inescapable that the Commission in determining the sum awarded used percentages which had the effect of placing the plaintiff on a basis of equality with the favored companies. On the other hand, there is testimony tending to show that had the cars been distributed upon a basis of general equality approved by the Commission, and without resort to practices condemned by it, there would have been cars enough to have furnished plaintiffs with a sufficient number to meet their trade and requirements during the period in question. Under the circumstances here shown, when the case is fairly and fully submitted, as it was in the charge of the judge to the jury, giving a correct basis upon which there might be a recovery of damages, and there is testimony tending to show damages in at least the sum awarded by the Commission, there is no prejudicial error because of the erroneous calculation of the Commission which was the basis of its award.\n Other questions are argued, but they are disposed of satisfactorily in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (269 Fed., supra), and in the opinion of the trial judge upon the motion for a new trial (263 Fed., supra).\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK v. NEW JERSEY(1921)\n\nArgued: January 25, 1921Decided: May 2, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Maurice B. Dean, William A. McQuaid, and William J. O.'Sullivan, all of New York City, and Merton E. Lewis, of Rochester, N. Y., for the People of State of New York.\n Messrs. Adrian Riker and Robert H. McCarter, both of Newark, N. J., George W. Wickersham, of New York City, Chandler W. Riker, of Newark, N. J ., and John W. Wescott, of Camden, N. J., for the State of New Jersey.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The people of the state of New York, in their bill filed in this suit, pray that the defendants, the state of New Jersey and the Passaic Valley sewerage commissioners, be permanently enjoined from discharging, as it is averred they intend to discharge, a large volume of sewage into that part of New York harbor known as the Upper Bay, for the reason, as it is alleged, that such pollution of the waters of the harbor will be caused thereby as to amount to a public nuisance, which will result in grave injury to the health, to the property, and to the commercial welfare, of the people of the state and city of New York.\n The Passaic river rises in the northeasterly part of \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n New Jersey and empties into Newark Bay. High land separates its watershed from direct drainage into the Hudson river or New York Bay, and on the lower 25 miles of it there are located the cities of Paterson, Passaic, and Newark, and also a number of such large towns that the population upon and near to the river is treated throughout the record as approximately 700,000 in 1911, when it was thought the sewer would be completed, and as likely to be about 1,650,000 in 1940, to which year it was designed to furnish adequate sewerage capacity. These cities and towns, from their earliest settlement, had all drained their sewage into the river. The ebbing and flowing of the tide almost to Paterson delayed the escaping of this sewage from the river and resulted in the water becoming greatly polluted. This polluted water was emptied directly into Newark Bay, but, ultimately, 84 per cent. of it, modified, no doubt, by nature's agencies, but still polluted, found its way through the natural channel of Kill van Kull, into Upper New York Bay.\n This drainage of sewage into the Passaic river resulted in the stream becoming such a menace to the health and property of the adjacent communities that, in 1896, a commission was appointed by the Governor of New Jersey, under the provisions of an act of the Legislature, to study the problem presented, for the purpose of divising some system of sewage disposal which would afford relief. After this commission had reported, a second commission of investigation was provided for by act of the Legislature in 1897, and its report was followed by a third similar commission in 1898.\n The reports of these various commissions led, in 1902, to an act of the New Jersey Legislature (P. L. 1902, p. 190) creating the Passaic Valley sewerage district, with boundaries embracing substantially the entire watershed of the Passaic river, and to another act, in 1907 (P. L. 1907, p. 22), prohibiting the dis charge \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n of sewage into the river after a date named, and directing the defendant, the Passaic Valley sewerage commissioners to prepare plans and specifications for a trunk sewer to dispose of the sewage and authorizing municipalities to contract with them for the service which they might require.\n Under authority of this act, the defendant sewerage commissioners in April, 1908, adopted a plan for sewage disposal, which provided for a main intercepting sewer, extending from the city of Paterson, along the right bank of the Passaic river, to a point in the city of Newark, and thence by a tunnel under the waters of Newark Bay and the cities of Bayonne and Jersey City to a point in Upper New York Bay about 500 feet north of Robbins Reef Light, where it was proposed to discharge the sewage at a depth of 40 feet of water below mean low tide. The estimated cost of the proposed sewer was $12,250,000.\n It was provided in the act authorizing the construction of the sewer that before any work should be undertaken or obligations incurred, a further investigation should be made by the commissioners as to whether the discharge of the sewage into New York Bay would be likely to pollute its waters to such an extent as to cause a nuisance to persons or property within the state of New York, and that the result of such investigation, with the reasons for it, should be presented to the Governor of the state.\n Such an investigation was made and upon report of the commissioners the Governor concluded that the discharge of the sewage as proposed would not pollute the waters of New York Bay so as to cause a nuisance to either persons or property within the state of New York, and the Attorney General of the state also advised the Governor that in his opinion the state of New York could not have any valid legal bojection to the use of the sewer as proposed.\n There can be no doubt that the various commissioners \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n who investigated this subject were men of the highest character and intelligence and that they studied it with the aid of the best obtainable sanitary engineers, chemists and bacteriologists, for the purpose of arriving at a solution which would protect and preserve the interests of all of the great communities involved. It is equally beyond doubt that the Governor and other officials of New Jersey, with full appreciation of the magnitude and seriousness of the undertaking, proceeded with great caution and with a settled purpose to fully respect the rights of the people of the state of New York.\n Learning of the plans of the state of New Jersey, thus detailed, the Legislature of New York passed an act providing for a commission to investigate the probable effect upon the waters of New York Bay of the proposed Passaic Valley sewer, with power to co-operate with the authorities of New Jersey with a view to arriving at some mutually satisfactory solution of the problem. The record shows that various conferences were held between the New York commission thus created and the Passaic Valley sewerage commissioners, but for some reason, which does not clearly appear, no mutually satisfactory course of action was arrived at, with the result that, in October, 1908, this suit for an injunction was commenced.\n For the purpose of showing its right to maintain the suit, the bill thus filed sets out, with much detail, an agreement between the states of New York and New Jersey, approved by Congress in 1834, establishing the boundary line between the two states and giving to New York, to the extent therein written, exclusive jurisdiction over the waters of the Bay of New York.\n But we need not inquire curiously as to the rights of the state of New York derived from this compact, for, wholly aside from it, and regardless of the precise location of the boundary line, the right of the state to maintain such a suit as is stated in the bill is very clear. The health, \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n comfort and prosperity of the people of the state and the value of their property being gravely menaced, as it is averred that they are by the proposed action of the defendants, the state is the proper party to represent and defend such rights by resort to the remedy of an original suit in this court under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 241\n, 243 S., 21 Sup. Ct. 331; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 U.S. 230\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488.\n Also, for the purpose of showing the responsibility of the state of New Jersey for the proposed action of the defendant, the Passaic Valley sewerage commissioners, the bill sets out, with much detail, the acts of the Legislature of that state authorizing and directing such action on their part.\n Of this it is sufficient to say that the averments of the bill, quite undenied, show that the defendant sewerage commissioners constitute such a statutory, corporate agency of the state that their action, actual or intended, must be treated as that of the state itself, and we shall so regard it. \n180 U.S. 208\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 331, supra.\n The remaining essential allegations of the bill are that the defendants are about to construct the sewer we have described and to discharge the sewage thereby collected into the Upper New York Bay, through a single opening 12 feet in diameter, at a point about half a mile north of Robbins Reef Light; that there would be about 120 millions of gallons of such sewage discharged into the bay every 24 hours in 1911, and in excess of 357 millions of gallons by 1940; that such sewage would be carried by the currents and tides into the Hudson and East Rivers and would be deposited on the bottom and shores of the bay and upon and adjacent to the wharves and docks of New York City, thereby so polluting the water as to render it a public nuisance offensive and injurious to persons living near it or using it for bathing or for purposes of commerce, damaging to vessels using the waters, and \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n so poisonous to the fish and oysters subsisting within it as to render them unfit for food. To prevent the public nuisance, which it is averred would thus be created, a permanent injunction was prayed for.\n The essential denials and allegations of the answer are as follows:\n Admitting their intention to construct the sewer substantially as described, it is averred: That New Jersey has a shore line of 25 miles on New York Bay and on the Hudson river, and that large cities and towns of that state border upon the bay, so that it has as important an interest as New York has in maintaining the waters free from pollution; that the sewer project objected to was authorized only after it had been recommended and approved by sanitary engineers of highest professional standing and experience and upon their assurance, after careful study of the tidal flow and currents of the bay, that appreciable pollution would not be caused thereby; that the Passaic river empties into Newark Bay and its water, charged, under existing conditions, with the sewage collected from the same communities intended to be served by the projected sewer, in large part reaches New York Bay in the vicinity of Robbins Reef Light, by natural channels, without causing substantial injury to the water; and that the city of New York has long been discharging into the bay at or near to the shore lines thereof, daily, more than seven times as great a volume of sewage (entirely untreated) as the daily discharge of the proposed sewer would be for many years to come. The answers concludes with further denials that the waters of the bay would be corrupted or their usefulness impaired by the use of the proposed intercepting sewer.\n After the defendants had answered, the government of the United States, by leave of court, filed a petition of intervention. The warrant assigned for this intervention was, the power and duty of the government with respect \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 304]\n\u00a0\n to navigation and interstate commerce, and the inherent power which it has to act for the protection of the health or government officials and employees at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and its duty to protect from damage the government property bordering upon New York Bay.\n The projected sewer was described in this petition of intervention, substantially as in the original bill, but it was averred that the plans for the removal of solids from the sewage were so indefinite and inadequate that the use of the sewer would result in the obstruction of navigation by the filling up and shoaling of the channels of the bay, and that the proposed purification of the sewage was so insufficient that the waters would be rendered unsightly and unhealthful to persons using them for commerce or dwelling upon the adjacent shores. It was averred that there were other, better and more advanced methods of sewage disposal than those proposed, and that the threatened injury to commerce and navigation, to the public health and to the property of the United States was not necessary. For these reasons the government joined in the prayer for relief.\n The coming of the government into the case was followed by conferences between its officials and the sewerage commissioners, with the result that a method of treatment of the sewage was decided upon much more thorough, comprehensive and definite in character than had been adopted before and the manner of dispersion of it at the outlet was so changed as to secure a much greater diffusion, at a great depth, in the adjacent waters.\n These changes were ultimately embodied in a stipulation between the United States, acting through its Attorney General, and the Passaic Valley sewerage commissioners, acting under authority of a special act of the New Jersey Legislature. It was agreed that upon the filing of this stipulation, properly executed, with the \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 305]\n\u00a0\n clerk of this court, the petition of intervention of the government should be dismissed, without prejudice-which was done on May 16, 1910.\n The stipulation provides, with much detail, that at or near to a pumping station to be located in the Newark Meadows, near Newark Bay, the material coming from the trunk sewer shall first pass through coarse screens to remove floating matter; then through a grit basin or basins, to remove heavy matter, as far as practicable; then through self-cleaning mechanical screens, with openings of not over four-tenths of an inch; and then through sedimentation basins, equipped with 'scum boards,' at a prescribed velocity of flow. It is provided that the effluent thus screened and settled shall flow into a pumping well, whence it is to be pumped under pressure to a point near Robbins Reef Light, where it is to be discharged at a depth of not less than 40 feet beneath the surface of the water at mean low tide, through 150 outlets, distributed over an area of 3 1\/2 acres, and so arranged as to drive the material horizontally across the tidal currents.\n The terms of this stipulation were adopted by the government under the advice of army engineers of high rank and by the sewerage commissioners on the advice of distinguished sanitary engineers and it must be accepted as established by the testimony taken in 1919 that at that time screening and sedimentation and thorough dispersion in water through deeply submerged multiple outlets was regarded by the most competent authorities as the most approved method of disposing of sewage in large volume.\n But, not satisfied with providing what was thought sufficient treatment to render the sewage innocuous, there was incorporated into the stipulation an agreement on the part of the sewerage commissioners that in the actual operation of the sewer at all times the following \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 306]\n\u00a0\n results should be secured, either through compliance with the requirements of the stipulation for treatment of the sewage, 'or through requisite additional lawful arrangements,' viz.: (1) There will be absence in the New York Bay of visible suspended particles coming from this sewage; (2) there will be absence of deposits caused by it objectionable to the Secretary of War of the United States; (3) there will be absence of odors due to the putrefaction of organic matter contained in the sewage; (4) there will be absence on the surface of the bay of any grease or color due to the sewage; (5) there will be no injury to the public health due to the discharge of the sewage, and no public or private nuisance will be created thereby; (6) no injurious effect shall result to the property of the United States situated upon the bay; (7) there shall not be a reduction in the dissolved oxygen content of the waters, due to this sewage, sufficient to interfere with major fish life. It is agreed that the government shall have unrestricted opportunity to inspect the workings of the sewer system, by designated officials, and that full compliance at all times with the provisions of the stipulation referred to shall be made an express condition of any permit issued by the government for the construction, maintenance or operation of the projected sewer system.\n It is obvious that if the conditions of this stipulation are realized and maintained, there will be no occasion or ground for such an injunction as was prayed for.\n It is argued, however, and expert witnesses have testified, that the provisions therein stipulated for screening and sedimentation and final dispersion of the sewage in the water, are not sufficient to produce the results which the sewerage commissioners agree with the government to produce and maintain, and that if such results as are feared by the witnesses are produced it would be impossible to determine whether they were caused by this \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 307]\n\u00a0\n particular sewage or by that coming from other sources and that therefore the agreement would, in practice, be nugatory. But equally well informed and credible witnesses testify that the proposed treatment would produce the stipulated results and that the source of such pollution, if any should be caused by the Passaic sewage, could readily be traced to its origin, and we think the probabilities greatly in favor of this conclusion, having regard to the opportunity secured to the government for inspection and observation of the treatment plant and for determining the quality and content of effluent before it is discharged into the bay and the effect which it may have on the water in the immediate vicinity of the outlet.\n It is also argued that this stipulation is not binding upon the state of New Jersey because executed only by the sewerage commissioners, and that it is invalid for want of power in the Attorney General to so stipulate on behalf of the United States.\n But since by act of its Legislature the state of New Jersey specifically authorized the sewerage commissioners to execute the stipulation and by its special counsel entered of record its approval of, and consent to, it, we must and do regard it as the valid obligation of the state as certainly as of the commissioners.\n As to the United States: The intervention of the Government was allowed upon allegations that the inadequate treatment of the sewage proposed would result in injury to navigation and commerce; by causing deposits of solid matter, to the extent of thousands of tons annually, which would fill up and shallow the channels of the bay; by rendering the port of New York less serviceable and attractive to commerce and offensive and unwholesome to persons using and living near it; and by causing injury to the hulls of vessels by the character of the effluent to be discharged. It was also averred that \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 308]\n\u00a0\n practically irreparable damage would be caused to extensive properties owned by the government adjacent to the bay.\n Having regard to the large powers of the government over navigation and commerce, its right to protect adjacent public property, and its officers and employees from damage and disease, and to the duty and authority of the Attorney General to control and conduct litigation to which the government may be a party (R. S. 359, 367, [Comp. St.  533, 542]), we cannot doubt that the intervention of the government was proper in this case and that it was within the authority of the Attorney General to agree that the United States should retire from the case upon the terms stated in the stipulation, which were plainly approved by the Secretary of War, who afterwards embodied them in the construction permit issued to the sewerage commissioners.\n Although this stipulation was filed and the government withdrew from the case on May 16, 1910, the remaining parties went forward and took a great volume of testimony, the taking of which was concluded in June, 1913. Five years passed before the case was brought on for argument at the October term, 1918, and upon examination this court, having regard to the long time which had elapsed since the taking of testimony was closed and to the rapid advance in sanitary science then in progress, suggested in the record, directed that additional testimony should be taken in order that the ocurt might be advised: (1) As to any practicable modification of the proposed sewer system which might improve it and reduce any polluting effect upon the water which might be caused by the effluent to be discharged; (2) as to any practicable plan or arrangement for sewage disposal which would lessen the polluting effect derived from the New York City sewage; (3) and as to the present degree of pollution of the waters of New York Harbor \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 309]\n\u00a0\n and the change in this respect since the taking of the testimony was closed.\n In compliance with this order much additional testimony was taken.\n With the record in this state we come to consider the evidence introduced, but subject to the rule that the burden upon the state of New York of sustaining the allegations of its bill is much greater than that imposed upon a complainant in an ordinary suit between private parties. Before this court can be moved to exercise its extraordinary power under the Constitution to control the conduct of one state at the suit of another, the threatened invasion of rights must be of serious magnitude and it must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Missouri v. Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago, \n200 U.S. 496\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 268.\n The water of New York Bay is such a brackish combination of salt sea and fresh water that it could not, under any circumstances, be used for drinking or other domestic purposes, and, therefore, the reasons given in the bill to justify the injunction prayed for are restricted, as we have seen, to the claims that the addition of the Passaic Valley sewage to the already polluted waters of the bay would result, in odors offensive and unwholesome to persons bathing in them or passing over them in large vessels or in small boats or living and working upon the adjacent shores, in causing unsightly deposits on the surface of the water and chemical action injurious to the wood and metal of vessels navigating the bay, and in rendering fish and oysters taken from such waters unfit for consumption.\n The evidence introduced, as to increase of damaging chemical action upon the hulls of vessels by the proposed addition of sewage, and as to danger from air borne diseases to persons using the water in boats and vessels or working or dwelling upon the shore of the Bay, is much too meager and indefinite to be seriously considered as \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 310]\n\u00a0\n ground for an injunction, and when it is considered that for many years all of the sewage from the great population of New York City and its environs and from the large cities on the New Jersey shore (estimated, in 1912, at 900 millions of gallons daily) has been discharged into the harbor, quite untreated, the evidence does not justify the conclusion that persons bathing in or that fish or oysters subsisting in such waters can sustain much further damage from the addition to them of the sewage of the Passaic Valley, after it has been treated in the manner proposed in the stipulation with the government.\n There remains to be considered, therefore, only the offensive odors, and unsightly deposits on the surface which it is claimed will be caused by the addition of putrescible matter to the water and it is to this claim that a large part of the evidence introduced by the complainant is directed. Much evidence was introduced tending to prove that sewage collected from so great in area as that of the Passaic Valley sewerage district would be stale, if not septic, when it reached the treatment plant at Newark Bay and that it would, therefore, hold in solution much organic matter which would not be removed by the screening and sedimentation processes proposed, with the result that it would cause disagreeable deposits on the surface of the water-'oily and sleek fields'- and offensive odors near the place of discharge and upon the wharves and shores adjacent to the bay.\n On the other hand, witnesses of seemingly equal candor and learning, and with large practical experience, called by the defendants, testified that they were confidently of the opinion that the treatment of the sewage provided for in the stipulation with the United States would cause such purification of it that the results guaranteed therein would be fully realized.\n It is much to be regretted that any forecast as to what the effect would be of the treatment and deeply submerged \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 311]\n\u00a0\n discharge through multiple outlets proposed for this large volume of sewage must depend almost entirely upon the conflicting opinions of expert witnesses, for experience with such treatment and dispersion under even approximately like conditions seems entirely wanting. It is, however, of much significance that the authorities of the city of New York, after many years of investigation of the subject of sewage disposal, in their latest plans propose to adopt a treatment of screening and sedimentation and dispersal in deep water very similar to, but not so extensive and thorough as that provided for in the stipulation between the defendants and the United States.\n There is only one point upon which all the experts called for the opposing parties agree, viz., that in the present state of learning upon the subject the amount of dissolved oxygen in water is the best index or measure of the degree to which it is polluted by organic substances, it seemingly being accepted by them all that upon the oxygen content in water depends its capacity for digesting sewage-that is for converting organic matter into inorganic and harmless substances by direct oxidation and by sustaining bacteria which assist in such conversion.\n The witnesses agree that so long as there is sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water the process of digestion of the sewage will go forward without producing offensive odors and that when it sinks below a required percentage of saturation such odors will appear, but, unfortunately, there is a wide divergence of opinion among them as to what the required lower percentage is. The opinions of seemingly well qualified experts vary in giving from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. of saturation as the amount of oxygen necessary to prevent the appearance of such offensive odors from decomposition of organic matter.\n Measured by this dissolved oxygen standard, the evidence of the complainant is that as early as 1906 the \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 312]\n\u00a0\n water adjacent to New York City, especially in the Bronx and lower East River was much polluted by sewage, but that the water in other parts of the bay, especially near Robbins Reef Light, was somewhat, but not greatly, contaminated. This condition, the evidence shows, continued with no very pronounced decrease in the oxygen content of the water until 1911 when the investigations embodied in the first testimony taken were concluded. And the evidence taken under the order of the court in 1919 shows an irrenconcilable conflict in the testimony as to the then condition of the water, especially near Robbins Reef Light, and as to the probable condition of it to be anticipated in the future. In the interval from 1906 to 1919 the estimated growth of the population of New York City and its suburbs draining sewage into adjacent waters was in excess of 100,000 a year-an increase of population in the aggregate much greater than the total population of the Passaic Valley sewage district at present and approximately equal to its estimated population in 1940-and it is undisputed that this New York sewage, untreated, was discharged from over 450 sewers directly into the adjacent waters, for the most part at or above the line of low tide, and that only in a few instances was it carried even to the pier heads.\n It would seem, therefore, that if the anticipations of the experts for the complainants, as to the results likely to be produced by the effluent from the sewer of defendants, were well founded, by the year 1919 conditions in the harbor should have become so pronounced and plain that there could not have been such conflict as the record shows in the testimony of trustworthy and competent scientists as to its then existing condition.\n Considering all of this evidence, and much more which we cannot detail, we must conclude that the complainants have failed to show by the convincing evidence which the law requires that the sewage which the defendants intend \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 313]\n\u00a0\n to discharge into Upper New York Bay, even if treated only in the manner specifically described in the stipulation with the United States government, would so corrupt the water of the bay as to created a public nuisance by causing offensive odors or unsightly deposits on the surface or that it would seriously add to the pollution of it.\n The evidence taken in 1919 also discloses that other means than those specifically described in the government stipulation may be resorted to, if needed, for the purpose of improving the character of the effluent from the sewer, viz. slower and more prolonged sedimentation processes; additional screening; the aeration of the sewage before it reaches the treatment plant and again after treatment and before discharge into the tunnel conveying it to the bay; and finally, if required, chemical treatment.\n Having regard to the treatment of the sewage prescribed in what we regard as a valid contract on the part of the defendants with the government of the United States, to the specific agreement therein for protection of the waters of Upper New York Bay from pollution, and to the means which the government will have to secure further purification, if desired, by refusing to permit the discharge of sewage into the bay to continue, we conclude that the prayer for injunction against the operation of the sewer must be denied.\n We cannot withhold the suggestion, inspired by the consideration of this case, that the grave problem of sewage disposal presented by the large and growing populations living on the shores of New York Bay is one more likely to be wisely solved by co-operative study and by conference and mutual concession on the part of representatives of the states so vitally interested in it than by proceedings in any court however constituted.\n The court, recognizing the importance of the ruling which it is making to the great populations interested, \n\n[256 U.S. 296, 314]\n\u00a0\n as well in the state of New Jersey as in the state of New York, will direct that the decree denying the relief prayed for shall be without prejudice to the instituting of another suit for injunction if the proposed sewer in operation shall prove sufficiently injurious to the waters of the bay to lead the state of New York to conclude that the protection of the health, welfare or commerce of its people requires another application to this court.\n It results that the bill of complainants will be dismissed without prejudice to a renewal of the application for injunction if the operation of the sewer of defendants shall result in conditions which the state of New York may be advised requires the interposition of this court.\n Bill dismissed without prejudice. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPERE MARQUETTE R.

Shields, of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n Mr. Clare J. Hall, of Grand Rapids, Mich., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The federal Uniform Bills of Lading Act of August 29, 1916, c. 415, 39 Stat. 538 (Comp. St.  8604aaa-8604w), provides by section 9 that a carrier is, subject to the provisions of sections 10, 11 and 12,\n'justified in delivering goods to one who is'\n\n\n (c)\n 'A person in possession of an order bill for the goods, by the terms of which the goods are deliverable to his order; or which has been endorsed to him, or in blank by the consignee, or by the mediate or immediate indorsee of the consignee.'\n The main questions presented for our decision in this case are whether, upon the facts hereinafter stated, there was a delivery to one in possession of the bill, and, if so, whether the delivery exonerated the carrier, it having been made without requiring surrender of the bill of lading.\n In 1917 J. F. French & Co. shipped a carload of potatoes from Bailey, Mich., to Louisville, Ky., by the Pere Marquette Railroad as initial carrier and the Big Four Railroad as connecting and terminal carrier. The shipment was made on a 'consignor's order' bill of \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 540]\n\u00a0\n lading in the standard form by which the car was consigned to the shippers' order at Louisville; and there was a notation:\n'Notify Marshall & Kelsey, % Capt. Bernard, Commissary, Camp Taylor.'\n\n The shipper attached the bill of lading to a draft on Marshall & Kelsey for the purchase price of the potatoes and sold and delivered both, duly indorsed in blank, to a bank at Grand Rapids. This bank transmitted for collection the draft, with bill of lading attached, to an Indianapolis bank. The latter, without obtaining payment of the draft, detached the bill of lading from it and wrongfully delivered the bill of lading to Marshall & Kelsey. The car having reached Louisville, its destination named in the bill of lading, it was physically delivered by the Big Four, upon request of one Bindner, to the Southern Railroad, to be forwarded to Dumesnil, under the circumstances hereinafter set forth, without requiring surrender of the bill of lading. Later, upon the refusal of Marshall & Kelsey to accept the potatoes and honor the draft, possession of the car and bill of lading was returned to the shippers, who accepted them under protest and, without waiving any rights which they might have, proceeded to dispose of the potatoes elsewhere, in order to make the damage as light as possible for all concerned. The shippers then brought this suit in a state court of Michigan against the Pere Marquette to recover compensation, contending that the carrier had by delivering the car upon request, without requiring surrender of the bill of lading, become liable for conversion of the potatoes. The court directed a verdict for plaintiff, and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Michigan. 204 Mich. 578, 171 N. W. 491. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n250 U.S. 637\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 494\n\n\n The following additional facts are material: Camp Zachary Taylor was located about six miles from Louisville on the Southern Railroad, near Dumesnil station. \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 541]\n\u00a0\n Marshall & Kelsey had contracted with the government to supply a large quantity of potatoes at this camp; and had made a contract of purchase with J. F. French & Co. The car in question was shipped to Louisville to be applied on these contracts. The indorsed bill of lading for this, as for other cars shipped under like circumstances, had been left by Marshall & Kelsey at Dumesnil with one Bindner, an employee of the Southern Railroad, for safe-keeping. He, having the bill of lading in his possession at Dumesnil, telephoned from there, at Marshall & Kelsey's request, to the Big Four Railroad to ascertain whether the car had arrived at Louisville. Finding that it had, Bindner, knowing the government's need of potatoes, told the Big Four trackage clerk that 'he had the bill of lading and to let the car go out to the camp.' Bindner had no specific instructions from Marshall & Kelsey to do this: but his action was later ratified by them. Upon receiving Bindner's further assurance that a small demurrage charge which had accrued would be paid, the trackage clerk, without requiring surrender of the bill of lading, released the car, changed the waybill so as to provide for delivery of the car at Dumesnil, and turned it over to the Southern. A charge of 6 cents per hundred pounds thereby became payable to the Southern Railroad for the local carriage from Louisville to Dumesnil; and it was left by the waybill payable by the consignee with the other freight charges upon receipt of the car at Dumesnil. The Big Four had no information that the draft covering the car had not been paid or of the circumstances under which Bindner obtained possession of the bill of lading. The car arrived at Dumesnil, but the government did not accept it. Thereupon Bindner returned the bill of lading to Marshall & Kelsey upon their request; they returned it to the Indianapolis bank; this bank returned it and the draft to the Grand Rapids bank, which in turn surrendered both to J. F. French & Co., upon being \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 542]\n\u00a0\n repaid the sum originally credited to their account. The shippers then took possession of the car, disposed of the potatoes elsewhere, but at a lower price, and brought this suit to recover the amount of their loss. The evidence is in conflict concerning the reason for the failure of the government to accept the potatoes, their condition, and the cause of deterioration in them, if any; and no finding of fact was made by the Supreme Court of Michigan on this issue. But, in an action for conversion the matter could affect only the question of damages and not that of liability; and it is not material in the view which we take of the case.\n There is no controversy over the amount of the loss. Nor is it denied that suit was properly brought against the Pere Marquette as initial carrier. The shipment was interstate. The shippers sue the inital carrier under section 20 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended (Comp. St.  8604aa), contending that there was a conversion of the goods by a misdelivery of them at Dumesnil instead of a delivery at Louisville; or, if it be held that there was a delivery at Louisville, that it was an unjustifiable delivery in violation of the contract of carriage, since a clause in the bill of lading declared:\n'The surrender of this original bill of lading properly indorsed shall be required before delivery of the property.'\n\n The carrier defends on the ground that there was a delivery at Louisville which exonerated it under section 9 of the federal Uniform Bills of Lading Act. Is the carrier liable for misdelivery, because the car was sent from Louisville to Dumesnil upon Bindner's request without requiring surrender of the bill of lading?\n First. The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the Big Four, in sending the car over the Southern to Dumesnil at the request of Bindner, made not a delivery but an irregular reconsignment. Whatever name be used in referring to the act of forwarding the car, the Big Four, when it surrendered possession of the car to the Southern at Bindner's \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 543]\n\u00a0\n request, terminated its relation as carrier; just as it would have done if, at his request, it had shunted the car onto a private industrial track or had given the control of it to a truckman on the team tracks. Having brought the goods to the destination named in the bill of lading the carrier's only duty under its contract was to make a delivery at that place; and it could make that delivery by turning the goods over to another carrier for further carriage. Compare Bracht v. San Antonio Ry. Co ., \n254 U.S. 489\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 150, 65 L. Ed. --, decided by this court January 3, 1921; Seaboard Air-Line Railway v. Dixon, 140 Ga. 804, 79 S. E. 1118; Melbourne & Troy v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co., 88 Ala. 443, 6 South. 762. The fact that in forwarding the car the Big Four used the original waybill, striking out the word 'Louisville' under the 'destination' and substituting 'Dumesnil, Ky. So. R. R.,' is of no significance. The shipment from Louisville to Dumesnil was a wholly new transaction. In turning over the car for this new shipment the railway made a disposal of it in assumed termination and discharge of its obligations, which was, in legal contemplation, a delivery. Whether it was a justifiable delivery and did indeed discharge its obligations we must next consider.\n Second. Was the delivery at Bindner's order one which the carrier was justified in making under the provisions of section 9 of the federal Uniform Bills of Lading Act? Prior to the enactment of the federal Uniform Bills of Lading Act, or of other applicable legislation, a carrier was not ordinarily relieved from liability to the consignor or owner for delivery of goods to a person not legally entitled to receive them, although such person was in possession of an order bill of lading duly indorsed in blank, and surrendered it to the carrier at the time of delivery. Delivery was held not to be a justification because the bill of lading, despite insertion therein of words of negotiability, did not become a negotiable instrument. Independently of statute (and, indeed, also under earlier state statutes) the \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 544]\n\u00a0\n insertion of words of negotiability had merely the effect of enabling title to the goods to be transferred by transfer of the document. See Berkley v. Watling, 7 A. & E. 29. But one who did not have a valid title to the goods could not by transfer of the bill of lading give a good title to a bona fide holder. Shaw v. Railroad Company, \n101 U.S. 557\n. When in the interests of commerce the federal Uniform Bills of Lading Act extended to bills of lading certain characteristics of negotiable paper in order to protect a bona fide purchaser of such bills, it was deemed proper to afford also certain protection to the carrier. This was done, in part, by providing in section 9 that the carrier would be justified in making delivery to any person in possession of an order bill of lading duly indorsed, with certain exceptions to be noted below.\n The shippers contend that Bindner was not 'a person in possession' of the bill, because he held it as agent for Marshall & Kelsey and not on his own account. So far as the carrier is concerned that fact is entirely immaterial. Under section 9 it is physical possession of the bill which is made a justification for delivery of the goods by the carrier. Under that section it is immaterial in what capacity the person holds possession of the bill, and also whether he holds it lawfully, or unlawfully, so long as the carrier has no notice of any infirmity of title. But the shippers' contention would not be advanced if it were held that the legal, not the physical, possession is determinative. For Bindner's request of the trackage clerk to have the car forwarded to Dumesnil was later ratified by Marshall & Kelsey. If his physical possession of the bill were deemed legally their possession of it, the physical delivery to him of the car would likewise be deemed legally a delivery of it to them and, hence, satisfy in this respect the requirements of section 9.\n The only exception to the rule justifying the carrier in making delivery to one in possession of an order bill of \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 545]\n\u00a0\n lading indorsed in blank, which is urged as applicable here, is where the carrier has information that the person in possession of the bill is not lawfully entitled to the goods. The shippers contend that the Big Four, when it made delivery of the car, had such information regarding Bindner. For this contention there is not the slightest basis in the evidence. The Big Four had no such information. Nor was there in the circumstances anything which should even have led it to doubt that Bindner was lawfully entitled to request that the car be shipped to Dumesnil.\n Concluding, therefore, that there was a delivery, that it was made to a person in possession of the bill of lading properly indorsed and that it was made in good faith, the important question remains: Does such a delivery exonerate the carrier upon suit by the shipper when it failed to require surrender of the bill of lading as provided in that instrument? In our opinion there is no exoneration where loss to shipper or subsequent purchaser of the bill results from such a failure; but where the loss suffered is not the result of the failure to take up the bill, mere failure to take it up does not defeat the exoneration.\n The plaintiffs seek to establish the carrier's liability for its failure to take up the bill on two theories-first, that they are bona fide purchasers of the bill left outstanding; and, second, that as shippers and owners their goods were converted by a delivery in violation of the terms of the bill of lading. But the shippers cannot claim the protection of section 11 of the act as bona fide purchasers of the bill, as those words are understood in the law, even if in taking back the draft and the bill of lading from the bank they can be deemed purchasers within the meaning of the act. They took back the bill of lading after the events here in question, with full knowledge of them, and because of them. The purchaser whom the act protects is he who is entitled to assume that the carrier has \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 546]\n\u00a0\n not delivered the goods and will not thereafter deliver them except to a person who holds the bill of lading. The purpose of sections 10, 11 and 12 is to give bills of lading attributes of commercial paper. Here the plaintiffs were not buying commercial paper but a lawsuit.\n There is nothing in the act which imposes upon the carrier a specific duty to the shipper to take up the bill of lading. Under section 8 the carrier is not obliged to make delivery except upon production and surrender of the bill of lading; but it is not prohibited from doing so. If instead of insisting upon the production and surrender of the bill it chooses to deliver in reliance upon the assurance that the deliveree has it, so far as the duty to the shipper is concerned, the only risk it runs is that the person who says that he has the bill may not have it. If such proves to be the case the carrier is liable for conversion and must, of course, indemnify the shipper for any loss which results. Such liability arises, not from the statute, but from the obligation which the carrier assumes under the bill of lading.\n Does a delivery without compliance with the surrender clause of the bill of lading render the carrier liable for conversion under the facts shown here? Although there is a conflict of language in the cases in which a shipper sues a carrier for delivery of goods without requiring a surrender of the bill of lading, there appears to be no conflict of principle or indecision. Where the failure to require the presentation and surrender of the bill is the cause of the shipper losing his goods, a delivery without requiring it constitutes a conversion. Babbitt v. Grand Trunk Western Railway, 285 Ill. 267, 120 N. E. 803; Turnbull v. Michigan Central Railway Co., 183 Mich. 213, 150 N. W. 132; Judson v. Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co., 131 Minn. 5, 154 N. W. 506; see First National Bank v. Oregon-Washington Railway & Navigation Co., 25 Idaho, 58, 136 Pac. 798. Compare Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Co., \n241 U.S. 190\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 541. But \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 547]\n\u00a0\n where delivery is made to a person who has the bill or who has authority from the holder of it, and the cause of the shipper's loss is not the failure to require surrender of the bill, but the improper acquisition of it by the deliveree or his improper subsequent conduct, the mere technical failure to require presentation and surrender of the bill will not make the delivery a conversion. Chicago Packing & Provision Co. v. Savannah, Florida & Western Ry. Co., 103 Ga. 140, 29 S. E. 698, 40 L. R. A. 367; Famous Mfg. Co. v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 166 Iowa, 361, 147 N. W. 754; Nelson Grain Co. v. Railroad Co., 174 Mich. 80, 140 N. W. 486; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. of Texas v. Gilbreath (Tex. Civ. App.) 144 S. W. 1051. In the Chicago Packing Co. case, supra, the court said:\n'The loss in the present case was not occasioned by the failure of the railway to require the production and surrender of the bills of lading, but by the faithlessness of Hobbs & Tucker to their principal.'\n\n Similarly, in the case before us, the failure of the carrier to require production and surrender of the bill of lading did not cause the loss. The same loss would have resulted if the bill had been presented and surrendered. The real cause of the loss was the wrongful surrender of the bill of lading by the Indianapolis bank to Marshall & Kelsey by means of which the car was taken to Camp Taylor and the shipper deprived of the Louisville market. Nor did the failure to take up the bill enable the buyer to throw back the loss upon the shippers. The shippers deliberately assumed the loss by their voluntary act in taking back the draft and the bill of lading which they had sold to the Grand Rapids bank. Doubtless J. W. French & Co.'s relations with Marshall & Kelsey and with the Grand Rapids bank and the relations of the latter with the Indianapolis bank made this course advisable. But it is clear that they were under no duty to do so, since the tortious act of the bank's agent for collection had occasioned the damage. Having assumed \n\n[254 U.S. 538, 548]\n\u00a0\n the loss of their own volition they should not be permitted to pass it on to the carrier merely because of its technical failure to take up the bill of lading. The delivery was made to one in possession of the bill of lading who could, and doubtless would, have surrendered it, had he not been prevented by distance from doing so. To hold a carrier liable under such circumstances would seriously interfere with the convenience and the practice of business.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES did not take part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILADELPHIA & R R. CO. v. DI DONATO(1921)\nNo. 297\nArgued: April 28, 1921Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. George Gowen Parry, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Francis H. Bohlen, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari directed to the review of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirming a judgment \n\n[256 U.S. 327, 328]\n\u00a0\n of the court of common pleas of the county of Philadelphia, which affirmed an award of the Workmen's Compensation Board of the state of Pennsylvania, allowed respondent, as widow of Pasquale Di Donato who, in the course of his employment by the railway company, was killed. Her petition was presented in the legal course to the board, and assigned for an investigation to a referee who reported an award in accordance with it.\n The company prosecuted an appeal to the board which affirmed the award and dismissed the appeal. The judgment was successively affirmed, as we have said, by the court of common pleas and by the Supreme Court.\n There is no connected finding of facts aside from conclusions of law. The referee found that Di Donato was employed by the company 'as a crossing watchman' at a particular public crossing, and that on March 18, 1918, at about 7:15 p. m., 'while acting in the course of his employment while flagging a train ... was struck by a train of the company and instantly killed.' The findings then recite that the company contended that at the time of the occurrence of the injury Di Donato 'was engaged in interstate commerce,' but it is added that the company 'failed to prove by the weight of the evidence that such was the fact,' and, further, that the company 'showed that many interstate shipments and trains passed over the rails of the defendant company, ... but they did not offer any evidence whatever to show that at the time of the occurrence of the injury Pasquale Di Donato was engaged in performing some duty incident to the passage of an interstate train; and since the burden is on the defendant to show by the weight of the evidence that the injured employee was at the time of the occurrence of the injury engaged in interstate commerce, we find as a fact' that at such time Di Donato 'was not engaged in work incident to interstate commerce.' It was further \n\n[256 U.S. 327, 329]\n\u00a0\n found that the company was 'engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce.'\n The finding by the board was that Di Donato 'was killed in the course of his employment for the defendant' while he 'was employed as a watchman upon a public crossing' where a public street 'crosses the tracks' of the company, and that 'an agreement was placed upon record that the defendant was engaged in both intrastate and interstate traffic.' The deduction of the board was the same as that of the referee, that the defense of interstate commerce, when set up by the defendant, became a matter of proof by competent and reliable testimony, and that the burden of proof of the same was thrown upon the defendant, and 'that the character of the employment undertaken in that respect must be determined by the work he had actually been engaged in at the very time of the accident.'\n The facts and the conclusions thus expressed by the referee and the board were, in effect, repeated by the Supreme Court and made the grounds of decision.\n The facts as found we may assume to exist, facts, however, disassociated from legal deductions from them. These facts are only that Di Donato was employed by the company as a flagman at a public crossing to signal both intrastate and interstate trains. In other words, his employment concerned both kinds of trains without distinction between them or character of service. He was an instrument of safety for the conduct of both. And in the course of his employment he was killed by a train whose character is not disclosed. These are the facts, all else the assertion of legal propositions. We are brought, therefore, to a consideration of the soundness and determining quality of the legal propositions.\n In Pedersen v. Delaware, etc., R. R., \n229 U.S. 146\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, this court had occasion to consider the instrumentalities of commerce and to determine whether they should have intrastate or interstate character. The \n\n[256 U.S. 327, 330]\n\u00a0\n case was concerned with mechanism-tracks and bridges, but there was a human element as well, one that was engaged in keeping the mechanisms in repair, and, it was decided, that as they were instruments of interstate as well as of intrastate commerce he was engaged in interstate commerce. It was said, 'true a track or bridge may be used in both interstate and intrastate commerce, but when it is so used it is none the less an instrumentality of the former; nor does its double use prevent the employment of those who are engaged in its repair or keeping it in suitable condition for use from being an employment in interstate commerce.'\n Being the same in principle if not in instances the following cases are urged to be of pertinent illustration, Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n of the State of California, 174 Cal. 8, 161 Pac. 1139, L. R. A. 1917E, 262; Graber v. Duluth, S. S. & A. Ry. Co., 159 Wis. 414, 150 N. W. 489; Chicago & A. R. R. Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 288 Ill. 603, 124 N. E. 344; Flynn v. N. Y. S. & W. R. R. Co., 90 N. J. Law, 451, 101 Atl. 1034; also Southern Railway Co. v. Puckett, \n244 U.S. 571\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 703, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 69, and cases cited.\n Respondent resists the application of the Pedersen Case and contends that the other cases do not militate against the judgment in the pending case. They, and the Pedersen Case, it is said, represent different classes- the Pedersen Case, 'those in which it is impossible to assign the service to any particular traffic movement, since the work is done on some instrumentality which is used indiscriminately in the general traffic of the road'; the other cases, 'those in which the service is given to expedite or secure the safety of some particular traffic movement.' To the latter class counsel for respondent assign the present case, and the Supreme Court accepted that view. Counsel, however, feel an impediment to their view in the fact that this court has given the Pedersen Case as authority for cases which counsel assign to the other class; that is, whose instance was the safety of some particular movement. But granting \n\n[256 U.S. 327, 331]\n\u00a0\n there is a basis for the classification that counsel make, we think the present case falls within the Pedersen Case. The service of a flagman concerns the safety of both commerces and to separate his duties by moments of time or particular incidents of its exertion would be to destroy its unity and commit it to confusing controversies.\n And besides, as observed by the Supreme Court of the state of California in Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra, Di Donato's duty had other purpose than the prevention of a disaster to a particular train. It had purpose as well to the condition of the tracks and their preservation from disorder and obstructions. This service and the other service cannot be separated in duty and responsibility. It is to be remembered that not only the remedy of one employee is involved in a particular duty but that other employees and other remedies are to be considered as well and the defenses to them, and that behind them are the respective powers that may have ordained them. Therefore, whether they be of state or congressional power, there is an equal necessity for their accurate delimitation. This case, therefore, has importance beyond the interest of the parties to it. Its principle and example, reinforcing the Pedersen Case and the cases based upon it, make a test by which future cases may be assigned to intrastate or interstate commerce and mark the power and policies that may be necessary or convenient to either.\n As we deduce from the duty of Di Donato his employment to have been in interstate commerce, we have no occasion to consider what presumptions might be indulged if his employment were not thereby established, whether for or against intrastate commerce.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILADELPHIA & R R.

McAdams, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania affirming an award made under the Workmen's Compensation Board of the state in favor of respondent who is the widow of John M. Polk, who died as the result of an accident, occurring in the course of his employment by the railway company.\n The matter of her petition proceeded in due course from referee of the board to the board, from the latter to the court of common pleas, and thence to the Supreme Court of the state, she being adjudged by all of them entitled \n\n[256 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n to an award under the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state (Pa. St. 1920,  21916 et seq.).\n The facts as found are that Polk on August 28, 1917, while employed by the railway company on a freight train, in its Port Richmond Yard, handled by engine No. 832 was caught between two cars, and as a result thereof sustained injuries from which he died.\n At the time of the occurrence of the injury the company was a common carrier, by rail, engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce, and that at such time there was a draft of freight cars attached to the engine which was in charge of the crew of which Polk was a member. Some of these cars were bound from points within the state to other points within the state and the others were loaded with various commodities, some of which were bound from points outside of the state to points within the state, and others of which were bound from points within the state to points outside of the state, and there was at least one car of this draft which was passing through the state from a point in New York to a point in Illinois.\n The board, upon the appeal of the company, adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the referee and affirmed his award. This action was affirmed by the court of common pleas and the latter's judgment by the Supreme Court. 266 Pa. 335, 109 Atl. 627.\n The referee did not find definitely as a fact that Polk was engaged in intrastate commerce at the time of his injury, but assumed that the fact might be so; therefore, regarded it as so, because in his (the referee's) opinion the burden of proving the contrary; that is, that Polk 'was actually engaged in work incident to interstate commerce,' was upon the company and the company had 'not met the burden required of it' and further, that the company 'offered no testimony whatever to show what work John M. Polk was performing at the time he was injured. ...'\n The Supreme Court approved the findings and the \n\n[256 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n deductions from them. It is manifest therefore that the case is within the rule of Philadelphia & Reading Railway Co. v. Maria Domenica Di Donato, \n256 U.S. 327\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 516, 65 L. Ed. --, just decided. Here, as there, the employment concerned both kinds of commerce and was to be exercised as much on one as on the other. In other words, was as much and as intimately directed to the interstate cars and freight as to the intrastate cars and freight, and that there might have been some duties directed to the latter though there is no evidence of it, is the suggestion of a speculation that has no tangible prompting in the case.\n Besides, we cannot accede to the view that there is a presumption that duties performed on a train constituted of interstate and intrastate commerce were performed in the latter commerce. The presumption, indeed, might be the other way. It is to be remembered that it is the declaration of the cases that if there is an element of interstate commerce in a traffic or employment it determines the remedy of the employee. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; New York Central Railroad Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, N. P. Ry. v. State of Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370, 375\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 160, declares and illustrates the principle. Expressing the facts and the law applicable to them, it was said:\n'The train, although moving from one point to another in the state of Washington, was hauling merchandise from points outside of the state destined to points within the state and from points within the state to points in British Columbia. ... This transportation was interstate commerce, and the train was an interstate train, despite the fact that it may also have been carrying some local freight. In view of the unity and indivisibility of the service of the train crew and the paramount character of the authority of Congress to regulate commerce, the act of Congress was exclusively controlling.

Gray, \n241 U.S. 16\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 486, in opposition.

U S(1921)\nNo. 173\nArgued: January 24, 1921Decided: March 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, of New York City, and Samuel W. Fordyce, Jr., of St. Louis, Mo., for appellants.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1907 the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, a Missouri corporation, was indicted in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Louisiana under the Elkins Act (Act Feb. 19, 1903, c. 708,  2, 32 Stat. 847 [Comp. St.  8597-8599]), for receiving rebates. In 1913 the company sold and transferred all its property to the Pierce Oil Corporation, all the proceeds were paid to Henry S. Priest and Clay Arthur Pierce as trustees, and they distributed the same among the stockholders. Of these Henry Clay Pierce and the Pierce Investment Company received millions in cash and stock and Clay Arthur Pierce a small amount. In 1914 the case under the Elkins Act was tried. The company was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $14,000, and in the following year the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. United States, 222 Fed. 69, 137 C. C. A. 293. An execution issued thereon to the marshal for that district and was returned nulla bona. Thereafter this bill in equity was brought by the United States in the federal District Court for the Eastern district of Missouri against the Waters- Pierce Oil Company, the trustees, and these three stockholders to obtain satisfaction of the judgment out of the money remaining in the hands of the trustees and that received by these stockholders. The District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill as against the Waters-Pierce Company and the trustees, but granted, as against the stockholders \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n named, the relief prayed by the government. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, one judge dissenting. The case is brought here by these defendants, under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). Reversal is sought on several grounds.\n First. The ground for reversal most strongly urged is that the judgment imposing a fine on the Waters-Pierce Company is not a debt on which a creditor's bill will lie. The argument is that a judgment for a definite sum of money does not necessarily endow the holder with all the rights of a creditor; that a court will look behind a judgment and will grant or deny relief according to the nature of the original cause of action, as it did in Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 U.S. 265\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1370, Louisiana v. New Orleans, \n109 U.S. 285\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 211, and Wetmore v. Markoe, \n196 U.S. 68\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 172, 2 Ann. Cas. 265; and that, since liability for a penalty is criminal in its nature and not strictly a debt, a creditor's bill cannot be brought upon a judgment for a penalty. It is true that to the liability for penalties imposed by the United States certain incidents of a criminal proceeding attach. See Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524; United States v. Stevenson, \n215 \nU.S. 190, 199\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 35. But the liability is often enforced by civil proceedings and specifically by the action of debt. Lees v. United States, \n150 U.S. 476\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 163. See Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch, 336, 340. And then certain incidents of civil proceedings attach. Hepner v. United States, \n213 U.S. 103\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 474, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 739, 16 Ann. Cas. 960.\n By section 1041 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1705) it is provided (in addition to the power existing by general usage to commit a defendant to jail until his fine has been paid, see Ex parte barclay [D. C .] 153 Fed. 669) that judgments for penalties 'may be enforced by execution against the property of the defendant in like manner as judgments in civil cases are enforced.' The statute applies to all judgment for penalties, whether recovered by civil or criminal proceedings. A judgment creditor's bill is in \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n essence an equitable execution comparable to proceedings supplementary to execution. See Ex parte Boyd, \n105 U.S. 647\n. The law which sends a corporation into the world with the capacity to act imposes upon its assets liability for its acts. The corporation cannot disable itself from responding by distributing its property among its stockholders and leaving remediless those having valid claims. In such a case the claims after being reduced to judgments may be satisfied out of the assets in the hands of the stockholders. \n1\n There is no good reason why the rule should be limited to judgments arising out of civil proceedings. To the contention that the statute has not made this process available for the government in enforcing a penalty, it may be answered as was done by the King's Bench a hundred years ago, in King v. Woolf, 2 B. & Ald. 609, 611, when it was insisted that a fine due to the crown was not a judgment debt for which execution could be levied:\n'... Mischievous consequences would ensue to the crown and the regular administration of justice, from a delinquent withdrawing all his property from the effect of a judgment; and the preventing that will not be a mischievous consequence to any one but himself. Here there is a judgment that the defendant do pay to the king a fine of a certain sum. By that judgment the debt becomes a debt to the king, of record; and it is payable to the king instanter. ... If we were to say that the crown shall not be at liberty to issue an immediate execution for its own debt, we should place the crown in a worse situation than any subject.'\n\n Second. It is contended that the right to bring a creditor's bill did not exist, because the judgment against \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n he company was not entered in the trial court until a year after the company had divested itself of the property sought to be reached in this suit; and the government did not become a creditor, at all events until after its claim for penalties had ripened into judgment. But when a corporation divests itself of all its assets by distributing them among the stockholders, those having unsatistied claims against it may follow the assets, although the claims were contested and unliquidated at the time when the assets were distributed. It is true that the bill a reach and apply the assets distributed among the stockholders cannot, as a matter of equity jurisdiction and procedure, be filed until the claim has been reduced to judgment and the execution thereon has been returned unsatisfied. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 U.S. 371\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 127. But, as a matter of substantive law, the right to follow the distributed assets (see Railway v. Howard, 7 Wall, 392, 409; Northern Pacific Ry v. Boyd, \n228 U.S. 482\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 554; Kansas City Ry. v. Guardian Trust Co., \n240 U.S. 166\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 334,) applies not only to those who are creditors in the commercial sense, but to all who hold unsatisfied claims. A corporation cannot by divesting itself of all property leave remediless the holder of a contingent claim, or the obligee of an executory contract ( Baltimore & Ohio Tel. Co. v. Interstate Tel. Co., 54 Fed. 50 4 C. C. A. 184), or the holder of a claim in tort (Hastings v. Drew, 76 N. Y. 9; Jahn v. Champagne Lumber Co. [C. C.] 157 Fed. 407); and there is no good reason why the United States with a claim for penalties should be in a worse plight. Here the stockholders receiving the assets are in the position of volunteers; and there is not even the excuse that they were ignorant of the government's claim. They were officers of the corporation, and the indictment was pending when the transfer of the assets was made. See Baltimore & Ohio Tel. Co. v. Interstate Tel. Co., supra. \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n Third. It is contended that the bill should have been dismissed because the execution issued to the marshal for the Eastern district of Missouri was not returned unsatisfied until after the commencement of the suit. It has been held that in litigations between private parties a creditor's bill cannot be maintained in a federal court upon a judgment recovered in a state other than that in which suit is brought (National Tube Works v. Ballou, \n146 \nU.S. 517, 523\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 165), and that a return unsatisfied of the execution issued on the judgment sued on is held essential to the maintenance of the creditor's suit (Taylor v. Bowker, \n111 U.S. 110\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 397). But this strict rule is not applicable where the United States is the judgment creditor. Under section 986 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1632) an execution issued in favor of the United States by any of its courts runs in every part of the United States, just as under section 985 (Comp. St.  1631) an execution on a judgment obtained in favor of any party in a District Court where the state is divided into two or more districts, may run and be executed in any part of the state. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 328. Here the execution issued to the Louisiana marshal had been returned nulla bona before this suit was brought; and it is agreed that when this suit was begun the Waters-Pierce Oil Company had no property in Missouri or elsewhere out of which the judgment could be satisfied at law. To hold that under such circumstances the suit must fail, because the return of nulla bona was not made by the marshal for the Eastern district of Missouri until after the filing of the roiginal bill, would apply a well-settled rule to a case not within its scope.\n Fourth. It is contended that the bill should have been dismissed because the government had an adequate remedy by suing the Pierce Oil Corporation, and, indeed, had commenced such a suit. That corporation assumed, as part of the purchase price of the Waters-Pierce Oil Company its 'debts, obligations and liabilities.' Before \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n commencing this suit the government had brought, in a federal District Court for Louisiana, a suit against the Pierce Oil Corporation, to subject to the satisfaction of its judgment certain parcels of land conveyed to the corporation by the Waters-Pierce Oil Company. But in the Louisiana suit the Pierce Oil Corporation denied liability insisting that the government was not a creditor of the Waters-Pierce Oil Company. The United States could not have been required to accept in lieu of its claim against the judgment debtor even an admitted obligation of the new corporation to pay it. The existence of that possible remedy did not bar the government from following by a creditor's bill the assets of the corporation into the stockholder's hands. Nor did the suit against the Pierce Oil Corporation amount to an election of remedies which should have led the lower courts to dismiss this bill. The two remedies were consistent. See Zimmerman v. Harding, \n227 \nU.S. 489, 494\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 387.\n Fifth. The contention is faintly made that the decree should be reversed because the District Court dismissed the bill as against the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, a necessary party, citing Swan Land & Cattle Co. v. Frank, \n148 \nU.S. 603, 610\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 691. The argument ignores the fact that this judgment, being in favor of the United States, is, under section 986 of the Revised Statutes, effective and may be made the basis of an execution running in a state and district other than that in which the judgment was rendered. It was doubtless for this reason that the District Judge concluded that it was unnecessary, if not improper, to enter in this suit judgment against Waters-Pierce Oil Company. The objection is purely technical. Since it was not set up among the many errors assigned in the Court of Appeals and in this court, it cannot be availed of here.\n Sixth. It is urged that the District Court erred in allowing interest on the penalty ($14,000) from the date \n\n[255 U.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n of the indictment, January 29, 1907. This was not assigned as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and for this reason that court refused to consider it on a petition for rehearing. In the assignment of errors filed in this court the objection was properly raised. Under rule 24 of the CircuitCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (188 Fed. xvi, 109 C. C. A. xvi) the court may 'notice a plain error not assigned or specified,' and we think it should have done so in this case. In allowing interest from January 29, 1907, the District Court was clearly under the misapprehension that that was the date of the judgment, for the decree so recites; whereas, in fact, judgment was not entered until March, 1914. But interest was not even allowable from that time. At common law judgments do not bear interest; interest rests solely upon statutory provision. Perkins v. Fourniquet, 14 How. 328; Washington & Georgetown R. R. v. Harmon, \n147 \nU.S. 571, 584\n, 585 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 557. The only applicable statute of the United States is section 966 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1605), which provides that 'interest shall be allowed on all judgments in civil causes. ...' Since the penalty was not recovered by civil process, but by judgment in a proceeding initiated by a criminal indictment, it obviously does not fall within the terms of the statute. Interest, therefore, is allowable only on the judgment from the date when it was entered against the defendants in this case, namely March 11, 1918\n\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, as modified, is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Wood v.

Thorgrimson, all of Seattle, Wash, for appellant.\n Messrs. W. H. Boyle, R. S. Terhune, and George F. Aust, all of Seattle, Wash., and Henry W. Clark, of New Yrok City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The main question in this case is whether the Oregon & Washington Railroad Company acquired, as owner of land adjoining East waterway in the port of Seattle, the right to build in the waterway piers, wharves, and other structures over which it would secure access from its land to the navigable channel. The question arises in a suit to quiet the title of the state which was brought against the railroad in a state court of Washington, in 1917, by the Port, a municipal corporation,1 created by the laws of Washington. J. F. Duthie & Co., lessees of the railroad's land, were joined as defendants; but they have no substantial interest in the controversy; and their peculiar rights do not require consideration. The case \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n was removed to the District Court of the United States by petition of the railroad, which is an Oregon corporation, and a motion to remand was denied. Upon full hearing on the merits a decree was rendered dismissing the bill. The case comes here by direct appeal of the port under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. Ct.  1215); it having been contended by the railroad and held by the lower court that the validity of chapter 168 of the Laws of Washington of 1913, p. 582, is involved, and that its provisions violate the contract clause and the due process clause of the federal Constitution. The following facts are material:\n When the state of Washington was admitted into the Union, there lay in front of the city of Seattle extensive tidelands in the area now comprised within the limits of the municipal corporation known as port of Seattle. Under appropriate legislation of the state this area has been developed as a port. Waterways have been established and in part dredge; tidelands abutting upon the waterways have been filled, platted as city blocks, and laid out with streets; and lots therein have been sold for business and other purposes. Among the waterways so established is that known as East waterway, which connects Duwamish river with Elliott Bay, an arm of Puget Sound. East waterway, as established, has at the point in question a width of 1,000 feet. The bed of the waterway was in its natural state tideland. The 750 feet of the waterway which lie in the center have been dredged to a depth at mean low tide of from 26 to 30 feet. The rest of the waterway, being that portion which extends on either side for a distance of 125 feet from the bulkhead of the filled land to the fairway, is of varying depth and is not navigable by large vessels. The bed of the waterway within these 125 feet areas slopes from the bulkhead to the line of the fairway. It is exposed at low tide ordinarily at points about 36 feet from the bulkhead. \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n The railroad's parcel here in question is filled land adjoining the west side of this waterway. The tract is a part of block 393, Seattle Tidelands, shown on a plat duly filed with the county auditor in 1895, and was acquired from the state by the railroad's predecessors in title prior to 1907. The deeds by which the state conveyed the land do not in words purport to grant any right in the waterway; nor is mention made of East waterway either in the granting clause or elsewhere in the deed. \n2\n On the plat, by which the land was sold, the boundaries of the block, and of the several lots comprised within it, are set forth clearly and lineal measurements are given. East waterway is shown on the plat and, on each side of the waterway, a broken line called 'pierhead line,' is marked at a distance of 250 feet from the bulkhead. It is alleged by the railroad that this pierhead line, established by the War Department as prescribing the limits beyond which structures obstructing navigation would not be permitted in the waterway, had been adopted also by the state authorities. In 1914, by joint action of the War Department and of the state authorities, \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n and with the assent of abutting owners, the pierhead line was moved back to a point 125 feet from the bulkhead, leaving the fairway in the center 750 feet, as above stated, instead of 500 feet as originally indicated on the plat. The rights claimed by the railroad are limited to this 125-feet area.\n Chapter 168 of the Laws of Washington 1913, p. 582, provides that:\n'Whenever, in any waterways created under the laws of the state of Washington, the government of the United States shall have established pierhead lines in said waterway at any distance from the boundaries thereof established by the state, no structure shall be allowed in the strip of waterway between the boundary and the nearest pier head line except by consent of the state land commissioner and upon plans approved and terms and conditions fixed by him, and then only for such period of use as shall be designated by him, but any permit shall not extend for a longer period than thirty (30) years: Provided, however, that the owner of land abutting upon either side of any such waterway shall have the right, if application be made therefor within a period of ninety (90) days following the date when this act shall go into effect, to obtain ...'\n\n -a permit authorizing the improvement and use of such area under conditions to be prescribed by the state authorities upon the payment of an annual rental dependent in amount upon the assessed value of an equal area of the abutting land.\n The railroad failed to apply for such a permit. Asserting the rights above stated, it leased a part of its land to J. F. Duthie & Co. for a shipbuilding and manufacturing plant, and purported to authorize the construction of wharves, piers and other structures upon the adjoining water area up to the 125-foot pierhead line. By the act of 1913 the control over the waterways therein conferred upon land commissioners is to be exercised in port districts \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n by the port commissioners. This bill to enjoin such use of the waterway by the railroad and its lessees and to quiet title was therefore brought by the port of Seattle.\n The decree entered by the lower court declared in substance (1) that the state has no proprietary interest in the water area between the bulkhead and the pierhead line; (2) that it is not entitled to lease the same or otherwise to deprive the railroad of access to the fairway; (3) that chapter 168 of the laws of 1913 in so far as it provides for such leasing violates the federal Constitution; (4) that the railroad has no proprietary interest in the waterway, but as owner of the abutting lots is entitled to access to the deep or navigable waters 'subject to proper governmental supervision.' The decree declared further that the state had never established harbor lines in the waterway, and expressly recited that the court does not determine whether or not the state now has power to establish harbor lines, nor what the effect might be of hereafter establishing them.\n The main question presented for our decision is whether the railroad acquired, in connection with the lots of filled land abutting on the waterway, a private riparian or littoral right to construct wharves, dock and piers on this 125-foot area, in order to provide for itself, as owner of the land, and for those claiming under it, convenient access to the fairway for purposes of navigation and commerce. The port contends that the railroad acquired no such right, nor any private right whatsoever, in any part of the adjoining waterway; and that the state is free either to use this portion of East waterway directly for purposes of navigation, as the present fairway is used, or to use it as a part of the harbor; and that, since it is also the proprietor of the tideland, under this water area, it has the full right to develop it, or authorize its development by others, through the erection of wharves, \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n piers, docks or other structures in aid of navigation and commerce; and to charge a rental for the privilege.\n First. The right of the United States in the navigable waters within the several states is limited to the control thereof for purposes of navigation. Subject to that right Washington became upon its organization as a state the owner of the navigable waters within its boundaries and of the land under the same. Weber v. Board of Harbor Commissioners, 18 Wall. 57. By section 1 of article 17 of its Constitution the state asserted its ownership in the bed and shore 'up to and including the line of ordinary high tide in waters where the tide ebbs and flows.' The extent of the state's ownership of the land is more accurately defined by the decisions of the highest court, as being the land below highwater mark or the meander line, which ever of these lines is the lower. \n3\n The character of the state's ownership in the land and in the waters is the full proprietary right. The state, being the absolute owner of the tidelands and of the waters over them, is free in conveying tidelands either to grant with them right in the adjoining water area or to completely withhold all such rights. Whether a conveyance veyance made by the state of land abutting upon navigable water does confer upon the grantee any right or interest in those waters or in the land under the same, is a matter wholly of local law. Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 548. Upon such questions the provisions of the Constitution and statutes of the state and the decisions of its highest court are accepted by us as conclusive. St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. St. Paul Commissioners, \n168 U.S. 349\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 157. The precise question presented here is whether the \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 64]\n\u00a0\n state by executing the deed of the land, which in fact adjoined East waterway, conveyed rights in that waterway. That question is, in essence, one of construction of the deed taken in connection with the plat therein referred to.\n Second. Under the law of Washington (which differs in this respect from the law generally prevailing elsewhere) a conveyance by the state of uplands abutting upon a natural navigable waterway grants no right of any kind either in land below highwater mark, Eisenbach v. Hatfield, 2 Wash. 236, 26 Pac. 539, 12 L. R. A. 632; or in, to, or over the water, Van Siclen v. Muir, 46 Wash. 38, 41, 89 Pac. 188; except the limited preferential right conferred by statute upon the owner of the upland, to purchase the shoreland, if the state concludes to sell the same. Act of March 26, 1890, section 11 and 12, Laws of Washington 1889-1890, p. 435. The grantee of the upland cannot complain of another who erects a structure below highwater mark, Muir v. Johnson, 49 Wash. 66, 94 Pac. 899. He does not acquire any right of access over the intervening land and water area to the navigable channel, Lowsdale v. Grays Harbor Boom Co., 54 Wash. 542, 550, 551, 103 Pac. 833. So complete is the absence of riparian or littoral rights that the state may-subject to the superior rights of the United States-wholly divert a navigable stream, sell the river bed and yet have impaired in so doing no right of the upland owners whose land is thereby separated from all contact with the water. Newell v. Loeb, 77 Wash. 182, 193-194, 137 Pac. 811; Hill v. Newell, 86 Wash. 227, 228, 149 Pac. 951.4- \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 65]\n\u00a0\n Lthird. The railroad admits that such are the rights of a grantee from the state, where it is the upland which is conveyed. But it contends that a different rule applies where the sale is of tidelands. No basis for the distinction can be found either in the decisions of the highest court of the state or in reason. Since the upland owner has been denied riparian rights in deference to the asserted right of the state to control unhampered the course and development of navigable waters, the state's right must be superior also to the claim of the tideland owner. For the assertion of title in the state was obviously made in order that it might not be hampered in developing waterways and harbors in the manner and to the extent that the public interest should from time to time demand. Such development obviously includes harbor facilities, like piers, docks and wharves, as well as adequate channels. Compare State v. Bridges, 87 Wash. 260, 151 Pac. 490. The proprietary right of the state over navigable waters and of the soil thereunder is neither exhausted nor impaired by making a sale of a tract of tideland, be it the parcel nearest the upland or some other. The state may in one year fill and sell the 100 feet of tidelands nearest the upland and in the next year fill and sell the parcel beyond. \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 66]\n\u00a0\n Compare State v. Scott, 89 Wash. 63, 70, 72, 154 Pac. 165. Or it may sell first the parcel more remote from the upland and later the one immediately adjoining it, or any other. In every case it may, in conveying the tideland, either grant or withhold rights in the water or in the water area, as it sees fit. When land washed by the ebb and flow of the tide is conveyed by the state with clearly defined boundaries, no rights of any kind beyond those boundaries ordinarily pass under the deed. Pearl Oyster Co. v. Heuston, 57 Wash. 533, 107 Pac. 349, 832, 135 Am. St. Rep. 1007. Where a tideland owner acquires rights of access to deep water it is by arrangement with the owner of the interevening land. Compare Pioneer Sand & Gravel Co. v. Seattle Construction & Dry Dock Co., 102 Wash. 608, 173 Pac. 508.\n The cases most strongly relied upon by the railroad do not relate to tidelands. They deal with the rights of shore land owners on an inland lake, the level of which had been lowered by the government. State v. Sturtevant, 76 Wash. 158, 135 Pac. 1035, 138 Pac. 650; Puget Mill Co. v. State, 93 Wash. 128, 160 Pac. 310. Shore lands differ from tidelands not only in their situation, which in many cases makes an almost indefinite filling in of the latter a possibility, but also in legal definition. Tidelands have a definite boundary at the line of mean low tide, or by later legislation, of extreme low tide. State v. Scott, supra, 89 Wash. 68, 69, 154 Pac. 165. The shore lands, on the other hand, were those 'below the line of ordinary high water and not subject to tidal flow.' They had no defined outer boundary. Accordingly when the waters of the lake there in question were lowered, it became necessary to determine the ownership both of the lands exposed and those below the new line of ordinary high water. The court held that the outer boundary of the shore land was the line of navigability, and that grantees were entitled to follow that line out when it was moved by act of their grantor. The considerations which brought the court to this result were, it is true, largely the \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 67]\n\u00a0\n same which in other jurisdictions led to the reccognition of riparian rights; that is, the claim of the shore land owner to access to deep water. But the court did not secure this interest to the shore land owner by granting him extraterritorial rights-i. e., riparian or littoral rights. It did so by construing the outer boundary of his land to be the line of navigability; holding that since the Legislature had not limited the outer boundary of shore lands, as it had done in the case of tidelands, it must have intended that the shore lands granted should extend to the line of navigable water, in the absence of legislation to the contrary. Compare Bilger v. State, 63 Wash. 457, 116 Pac. 19. The Legislature confirmed this boundary, expressly restricting it to the lands to which the court had applied it; that is shore lands not within city limits. This doctrine can have no application to shore lands where the property line is fixed in the deed. And it cannot apply to tidelands, the dissimilarity of which to shore lands furnished the ground for enunciating the rule.\n It appears, therefore, that the law of Washington does not recognize, as appurtenant to upland, tideland, or shore land in its natural condition, rights of any sort beyond the boundaries of the property. A right of access to the navigable channel over intervening land, above or below low water, must arise from a grant by the owner of the intervening property.\n Fourth. The railroad contends that a different rule should be applied here where we are dealing with made land abutting on an artificial waterway. East waterway is not properly described as such. It is a natural waterway deepened and confined. Compare Fox River Flour & Paper Co. v. Kelley, 70 Wis. 287, 800, 35 N. W. 744. And obviously the mere fact that tideland conveyed has been filled would not, by the law of Washington, confer upon the grantee, as appurtenant to the land, riparian rights in adjoining navigable waters. But the railroad insists \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 68]\n\u00a0\n that even if the right of access to the navigable channel is not appurtenant to its land as a matter of riparian law, its predecessor in title received the right by implied grant from the state. The right, it says, 'depends in the last analysis upon a proper construction of the grant by the state of the abutting lots' in the light of all the circumstances. Among the most important of those, is the fact that the whole development project was an artificial creation. Land, it is urged, was artificially made up to a bulkhead. At some distance beyond a navigable channel was artificially created out of an unnavigable stream. Between the bulkhead and the channel are shoals which prevent full use of waterside lots in connection with navigation unless wharves are erected. When the original grant was made no provision in the law authorized leasing these shoals for docking purposes, but on the contrary the whole waterway was reserved by the statute forever from sale or lease. And, finally, the plat, by reference to which all lots were sold, showed a pierhead line at the point of navigable water. This situation, it is urged, indicates that the lots were sold as part of a completed project, that it was intended they should have full shipping facilities, and that since the state could not lease the shoals under then existing legislation, it must have been the intention that abutting owners should have the right of access to the pierhead line. This argument of the railroad rests, however, upon an assumption which is at least open to serious doubt. It asserts that under then existing legislation no state official was authorized to permit the grantee to construct a wharf in East waterway. By the Constitution (article 15, section 1) and by Act of March 28, 1890, p. 239, provision had been made for the establishment of harbor lines in navigable waters. It appears from Wilson v. Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co., 71 Wash. 102, 107, 127 Pac. 847, to have been the practice to permit parts of the \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 69]\n\u00a0\n harbor area so created to be used for the erection of piers and wharves. East waterway was and is one of the navigable waters of the state. Our attention has not been called to any statute or decision which indicates that at the time of the original grant power to create harbor areas in it and to grant permits to erect wharves therein would not have been possessed by the harbor commissioners.\n Even if the assumptions upon which the arguments rest were all true, the conclusion contended for would not follow. Ever since the organization of the state it has been the clearly defined policy of Washington not to grant riparian rights in navigable waters. This policy, declared in its constitution and expressed in careful legislation, has been consistently enforced by its courts. A grant by implication of the riparian right here asserted might perhaps be inferred in other jurisdictions from the circumstances stated. But in Washington such an implication seems wholly inadmissible. If in the development in question it had been the intention of the state to make such a radical departure as that for which the railroad contends, the intention would doubtless have been expressed by appropriate language in the deed. But East waterway was not even mentioned in it. Until we are so informed by the Supreme Court of Washington, we cannot, in the light of the waterway history of the state, beleive that there were implications in the situation described which without more are sufficient to indicate an intention to depart from the settled policy of the state.\n So far as the pierhead lines are concerned, the railroad concedes that their establishment by the United States did not create as against the state a right to wharf out. They merely fixed the line beyond which piers might not extend. Compare Wilson v. Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co., supra, 71 Wash. 107, 108, 127 Pac. 847. And the power of the United States in this respect was not exhausted by \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 70]\n\u00a0\n its first exercise. Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 638\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 340. The lines so fixed, although acted upon by the erection of piers, could be changed by the United States at any time. Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison, \n237 U.S. 251\n.5 From the authorities to which we have been directed it appears that under the laws of the state the presence of pierhead lines on the plat could have no effect other than as a publication of action taken by the federal government. In Puget Mill Co. v. State, 93 Wash. 128, 160 Pac. 310, decided in 1916, the power of state officials to establish such lines is expressly denied by Judge Chadwick, who said:\n'The use of the words 'pierhead line' on the plat prepared by the state, and in the decree, is an unfortunate misuse of terms. The word means nothing under our Constitution and statutes. In some of the Eastern states, we understand that 'pierhead lines' are defined, but the constitution makers in this state were careful to avoid the confusion that may result from the drawing of an arbitrary line beyond which piers and docks should not be erected, by providing for an inner and an outer harbor line with an intervening area subject to state ownership and control.'\n\n It is unnecessary, therefore, for us to consider whether on this record it is open to the port to contend that pierhead lines were in fact never fixed by any state official.\n Fifth. The port renews here the objection that the case was improperly removed from the state court, Germania Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, \n119 U.S. 473\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 260; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Alabama, \n155 U.S. 482\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 192; insisting that since the state is the owner of the bed of East waterway, it is the real party in interest, Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., \n213 U.S. 151\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 458; Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, \n235 U.S. 461\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 173; and that it has not merely a governmental interest, as in Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 390\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1047, and in Missouri, Kansas & Texas \n\n[255 U.S. 56, 71]\n\u00a0\n Railway Co. v. Missouri Railroad & Warehouse Commissioners, \n183 \nU.S. 53, 60\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 18. The objection to the jurisdiction of the District Court is clearly unsound. The port, being a municipal corporation under the laws of Washington, is a citizen of that state and could have been sued in the federal court. Lincoln County v. Luning, \n133 U.S. 529\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 363; Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 U.S. 529\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 695. It had both the power and the duty to bring suit to protect the interests here involved; and it had a direct financial interest in the result. For chapter 168 of the Laws of 1913 provides for a payment by abutting owners, in the nature of a rental, for the permit to use parts of the waterways in the erection of wharves, docks or other structures, and that 75 per cent. of such rental shall be paid to the county 'for the use of said port district.' The port has thus an independent financial interest in this controversy; and although the state has also an interest, suit against the port would not be prevented by the Eleventh Amendment. What effect the judgment in this case will have upon the state's interest we have no occasion to consider. Compare Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 U.S. 204\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 770; Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, \n221 U.S. 636\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 654, 35 L. R. A. (N.

See 27 R. C. L., sections 273-279, 284.

Sebrell, Jr., of Norfolk, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. R. E. Evans, of Dakota City, Neb., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The City of Fremont is a city of Nebraska of the first class, having more than 5,000 and less than 25,000 inhabitants. By an ordinance duly enacted in 1903 and re-enacted in 1907, there was levied a license tax upon businesses and occupations within the city including telegraph offices. Upon these offices it levied a tax of $60.00 per year on the business and occupation of sending \n\n[255 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n messages from the city to any place in the state, and receiving messages transmitted from any place in the state, and receiving messages transmitted from any place in the state to the city, except messages received from or transmitted to any department, agency or agent of the United States, and except messages which were interstate commerce.\n Plaintiff in error, herein called the Postal Company, is a corporation engaged in such business within the city, it having been in December, 1881, permitted by the constituted authorities of the city, in the manner provided by its ordinance to occupy and use the streets of the city for that purpose, the ordinance providing that it was 'subject to such regulations as have been or may be provided by ordinance,' and that nothing in the article granting such consent to the use and occupation of the streets should 'be construed to prevent said city from further regulating, licensing or taxing any person, company or corporation owning, using or operating any telephone or telegraph lines within the corporate limits of said city.' The Postal Company in accordance with the ordinance paid a license tax of $60.00 a year for the years 1903 to 1914, each inclusive, but did not pay for the years 1915 and 1916, and this action was brought for the recovery of the same with interest at 7 per cent.\n The defenses of the Postal Company set up in its answer are that it is compelled by the charter of its organization to do intrastate as well as interstate telegraphing, that it paid the license tax for the years alleged inadvertently and without recognition of its legality; that it has accepted the terms of the Post Road Act of July 24, 1866 (Comp. St.  10072-10077), and is entitled to its benefits; that the tax is confiscatory and prohibitive and deprives the company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. In specification of this defense it is alleged that the receipts of the company for 1914 on its \n\n[255 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n intrastate business were only $108.28, and for the year 1915, $83.96, and that the expenses properly chargeable against these years respectively, exclusive of the tax, were $185.56 and $154.26, and that its loss on intrastate business would have to be made up from interstate business; that the city is under no expense by reason of the poles and wires of the company being in the city, and that $60.00 a year is in excess of a rental charge upon them, and that the streets are post roads within the meaning of the Post Road Act of 1866. In further defense the answer alleges that the tax is one on interstate commerce; that it deprives the company of the equal protection of the laws and impairs the obligation of a contract, both in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n The case was tried to a jury, which, after evidence taken, was instructed by the court to return a verdict for the city in the sum of $ 135.00.\n A motion for new trial was denied, and judgment was rendered upon the verdict. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (103 Neb. 476, 172 N. W. 525), the Supreme Court deciding: (1) The tax was 'not a mere license or regulation measure, but one designed for revenue purposes,' and that its extent was 'a matter for the judgment and discretion of the municipal government, subject only to the restriction that it must not be prohibitory'-citing 2 Cooley on Taxation (3d Ed.) 1139, 1440. (2) The tax was not prohibitive; that proof of loss for two years without showing what volume of business was available in the municipality, or what portion was done by the company or what its facilities were for handling the business, was not sufficient to show that a tax of $60.00 imposed for revenue purposes on the privilege of doing an intrastate business in a city of over 8000 inhabitants was unreasonable. (3) In imposing an occupation tax for revenue purposes a municipality acts as the agent of the state, and where a tax is imposed upon a telegraph company doing an in \n\n[255 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n trastate and an interstate business and the revenue derived from its intrastate business as a whole becomes insufficient and the tax may become a burden on its interstate business, 'section 7409, Rev. St. 1913, provides a remedy.'\n The only contention that the Postal Company makes here is that the tax 'is in effect an imposition upon its interstate business.' It has this effect, is the assertion, because its 'intrastate business at Fremont is insufficient to pay the tax which if compelled, must be paid from the company's interstate business,' because it is required to do an intrastate business by section 7408 of the state statutes, and its charges are prescribed by the section. For the contention and its supporting assertions the company relies on Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. City of Richmond, \n249 U.S. 252\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 265.\n We cannot assign to that case the determining force that counsel attribute to it. The case clearly declares that a license tax may be lawfully imposed on a telegraph company for the right to do business within the borders of the municipalities of a state. The power, of course, has its limitations and must be exercised with due relation to the company's interstate business. That relation is always to be considered, but it is not disposed of by the simple assertion of a loss. The cause of it or the condition of it is to be considered. In this case the tax is $60. 00 a year. It certainly cannot be said that it is repellant from its amount, and there is no pretense that its imposition 'is a disguised attempt to tax interstate commerce.' The Postal Company when it entered the city, the ordinance levying the tax then being in existence, did not declare against its legality or complain of its detrimental operation. Indeed, for the privilege of entering the city it subjected itself to further regulation, licensing and taxing. And it paid the tax from that time until 1914. The allegation in its answer that it paid the \n\n[255 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n tax 'through the mistake and inadvertence of' its 'clerical force' we are not disposed to accept, without more, as an explanation.\n The Supreme Court expressed the view that mere proof of loss for two years, which may have been exceptional, determined nothing in the absence of a showing what business was available to the company or what facilities it had or used, and also held that, the city being an agent of the state, any deficit arising from the tax imposed on the intrastate business of the company can be prevented from becoming a burden upon the company's interstate business by an application to the State Railway Commission under the provisions of section 7409 for an increase of its intrastate rates. And the suggestion is pertinent. The company, as we have seen, cites section 7408 as a compulsion upon it to engage in intrastate business and at designated rates. From the rigor of the requirement section 7409 provides a mode of relief, and until it is denied the company cannot complain under the circumstances presented by this record. In other words, if section 7408 is imperative upon the company to continue intrastate business, section 7409 affords a means of obtaining relief from burdensome obedience. The sections are counterparts. If submission to section 7408 results in insufficient revenue and a burden upon interstate commerce it is made the duty of the Railway Commission by section 7409 upon complaint of the Postal Company to raise the intrastate rate 'fixed' in section 7408. No attempt to secure relief under section 7409 appears to have been made.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRIVETT v. U.S.(1921)\nNo. 236\nArgued: March 18, 1921Decided: April 18, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Preston C. West and A. A. Davidson, both of Tulsa, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnett, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought this suit to cancel conveyances made by the heirs of a Creek Indian of land allotted to him as a homestead out of the Creek tribal lands. After answer and hearing the District Court granted the relief sought and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 261 Fed. 351.\n The allottee was an Indian of the half blood and died intestate in 1911 leaving as his heirs a widow, an adult daughter, and a minor son, all of whom were Creek Indians. Thereafter deeds purporting to convey the land to one Privett were executed by the heirs, the deed of the minor son being made by his guardian. These are the conveyances sought to be canceled, and the ground on which they are assailed is that the minor son was born after March 4, 1906, and therefore that the land passed to the heirs subject to the qualification and restriction imposed by a proviso in section 9 of the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, which declares:\n'That if any member of the Five Civilized Tribes of one-half or more Indian blood shall die leaving issue surviving, born since March fourth, nineteen hundred and six, the homestead of such deceased allottee shall remain inalienable, unless restrictions against alienation are removed therefrom by the Secretary of the Interior in the manner provided in section one hereof, for the use and support of such issue, during their life or lives, until \n\n[256 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n April twenty-six, nineteen hundred and thirty-one; but if no such issue survive, then such allottee, if an adult, may dispose of his homestead by will free from all restrictions; if this be not done, or in the event the issue hereinbeforeprovided for die before April twenty-six, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, the land shall then descend to the heirs,' etc.\n\n The minor son is still living, and, if he was born after March 4, 1906, it is conceded that the heirs took the land subject to the qualification and restriction imposed by the proviso (see Parker v. Riley, \n250 U.S. 66\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 405), that there was no removal of the restriction by the Secretary of the Interior, and that the conveyances made by the heirs are void. But it is urged: First, that the evidence produced at the hearing shows that the minor son was born before, and not after, March 4, 1906; and, secondly, that, in any event, it was settled conclusively in a prior suit that he was born February 23, 1906\n\n\n The District Court found that the date of the son's birth was April 23, 1906, and the Circuit Court of Appeals acquiesced in that finding without particularly discussing the point in its opinion. The evidence has been examined and in our opinion it amply supports the finding.\n The reliance on the decision in the prior suit is ill-founded. That suit was between the heirs and one who was claiming under these conveyances, the United States not being a party, and the decree therein pronounced the conveyances valid. This suit is brought by the United States in virtue of its interest in maintaining the restriction and safeguarding the Indians in the possession and enjoyment of the lands allotted out of the tribal domain. As yet the Indians have not been fully discharged from the guardianship of the United States. 'During the continuance of this guardianship, the right and duty of the nation to enforce by all appropriate means the restrictions designed for the security of the Indians cannot \n\n[256 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n be gainsaid. While relating to the welfare of the Indians, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress has prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is distinctly an interest of the United States.' Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 437\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 424, 431 (56 L. Ed. 820). See, also, La Motte v. United States, \n254 U.S. 570\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 204, 65 L. Ed. --. 'And it is no longer open to question that the United States has capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside conveyances of lands allotted to Indians under its care, where restrictions upon alienation have been transgressed. ... Authority to enforce restrictions of this character is the necessary complement of the power to impose them. It necessarily follows that, as a transfer of the allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress would be a violation of the governmental rights of the United States arising from its obligation to a dependent people, no stipulations, contracts, or judgments rendered in suits to which the government is a stranger can affect its interest.' Bowling v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 528, 534\n, 535 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 659, 660 (58 L. Ed. 1080). As the United States is here suing in its own interest, it is in no wise concluded by any matter, whether of fact or law, that may have been adjudged in the prior suit to which it was not a party.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUONG HAM WAH CO. v. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA(1921)\nNo. 638\nArgued: March 9, 1921Decided: March 21, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Warren Gregory, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[255 U.S. 445, 446]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warren H. Pillsbury, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Quong Ham Wah Company is engaged in the business of supplying to canneries in California and else where \n\n[255 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n the labor required by them to carry on their canning operations. The company in 1918 hired in the city of San Francisco one Owe Ming, a resident of California, under an agreement that he was to work as its employee at the cannery of the Alaska Packers' Association at Cook's Inlet, Alaska, during the canning season, and that upon his return to San Francisco he would be paid off by the Quong Ham Wah Company and his employment terminated.\n While working at the cannery Owe Ming sustained an injury resulting in a permanent disability, for which on returning to San Francisco he petitioned the Industrial Accident Commission of California for the allowance of compensation under Workmen's Compensation Act (St. 1917, p. 870)  58 of which provides:\n'The Commission shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered without the territorial limits of this state in those cases where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state, and any such employee or his dependents shall be entitled to the compensation or death benefits provided by this act.'\n\n The Alaska Packers' Association was joined with the Quong Ham Wah Company as defendant in the proceedings before the Commission, which culminated in a joint and several award against the said defendants. Thereafter the Quong Ham Wah Company filed with the Commission a petition for rehearing, asserting among other things, that the Commission was without jurisdiction to award compensation for injuries occurring outside the territorial limits of the state of California, except as provided in section 58 of the Compensation Act, and that that section was void as repugnant to article 4,  2, of the Constitution of the United States, because it granted to citizens of California the privilege of recovering for injuries sustained outside the state in the course of employments \n\n[255 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n contracted for within the state, while at the same time denying that privilege to citizens of other states. The rehearing was refused by the Commission.\n The company thereupon applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was allowed, and that court, concluding that section 58 discriminated against nonresidents as alleged and was consequently repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and void, decided that the Commission was without jurisdiction and annulled its award. Upon a rehearing, however, this view was retracted, and the court concluded that the effect of the constitutional provision relied upon was, not to render void the provisions of section 58 for discrimination against nonresidents, but to lead to or cause a construction of that section which would include citizens of other states, and therefore avoid all question as to the discrimination relied upon. The court consequently held that 'the statute itself is valid and may be made to apply uniformly to citizens of California and the citizens of the other states,' and, giving effect to this interpretation, affirmed the action of the Commission.\n To reverse the judgment so rendered this writ of error is prosecuted. All the assignments and contentions made rest in their last analysis upon the assumption that, despite the construction of the statute made by the court below, it still must be here treated as repugnant to the Constitution because operating the discrimination originally complained of. But it is elementary that this court is without authority to review and revise the construction affixed to a state statute as to a state matter by the court of last resort of the state.

Town of Graham, \n253 U.S. 193\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 453.\n True it is elaborately argued that the court below erred in supposing that the statute was susceptible of the construction which it affixed to it, and that, instead of adopting that construction, its duty was to hold the statute void for repugnancy to the Constitution on the grounds which were urged. But this in a different form of statement but disputes the correctness of the construction affixed by the court below to the state statute, and assumes that that construction is here susceptible of being disregarded upon the theory of the existence of the discrimination contended for when, if the meaning affixed to the statute by the court below be accepted, every basis for such contended discrimination disappears. It follows that the argument but accentuates the frivolous character of the federal question relied upon.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAFFERTY v.

The petitioner was tried, convicted and sentenced, the record stating that 'to try this cause come a jury of good and lawful men duly impaneled, sworn and \n\n[255 U.S. 450, 451]\n\u00a0\n charged a true verdict to render according to the law and the evidence.' During the term the petitioner filed a motion setting forth that as the result of an agreement between himself and the District Attorney the case was tried before a jury of eleven, and asking to have the record corrected to show the fact. There was also another motion to set aside the judgment on this ground. The record recites that after hearing the evidence and argument the Court being of opinion that the record is as it should be, and does not need amendment, denies the motion, and similarly denies the motion to set aside the judgment. The record discloses exceptions to both orders but sets forth no grounds. No exception to the jury seems to have been taken nor does the fact alleged or the exclusion of any evidence competent to prove it appear of record in any form.\n The petitioner now comes here asking for a mandamus to correct the judge's conclusion and setting forth evidence offered in support of his motion that was rejected and that he says should have been received. He might have saved the point by an exception at the trial or by a bill of exceptions to the denial of his subsequent motion, setting forth whatever facts or offers of proof were material, and then have brought a writ of error. Nalle v. Oyster, \n230 \nU.S. 165, 177\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 1043. In such cases mandamus does not lie.

An appeal to this Court lies in such a case. Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v. Hammond Elevator Co., \n198 U.S. 424\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 740. The material facts are as follows: The action is brought by an Ohio corporation upon a contract made with the defendant, a Missouri corporation, to deliver 'f. o. b. cars Ann Arbor, Michigan,' specified woodwork for the library building of the University of Michigan, upon which the defendant was engaged. The contract was made by correspondence between the plaintiff in Cincinnati and the defendant in Chicago, and would seem from the affidavits and exhibits to have become operative by the posting of a letter of the defendant accepting corrections, at Chicago, on February 10, 1917, although by the declaration it is alleged to have been made in Cincinnati. Beaumont v. Prieto, 249 U. S. \n\n[257 U.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n 554, 29 Sup. Ct. 383. The defendant is a contractor, constructing buildings and the like, and, being a foreign corporation, in 1910 had designated Simeon Nash as a person upon whom process against it could be served within the State of Ohio, as required by statute. Subsequently it constructed buildings in Ohio, but its last work was finished on October 29, 1918, and its workmen and property were withdrawn from the State. Since that date it has made no bids for work there. This action was begun on April 5, 1919, in a State Court of Ohio, but afterwards was removed to the District Court of the United States. The only service was upon Nash, and the question is whether it was sufficient in the circumstances set forth.\n An annual report is required by Gen. Code,  5499, for foreign corporations for profit doing business in the State. The defendant filed such a report in July, 1919, after the service, and no doubt would have been ready to bid upon Ohio contracts that seemed to it tempting, as it had done in the past. The plaintiff contends that these facts show that it was doing business in Ohio when the writ was served. The defendant says that the report was necessary for the ascertainment of taxes due from it for the last financial year, but it may be assumed that the wish to keep open the possibility of further employment was a contributing motive. It did nothing, however, and it contends that merely watching from outside for a chance was not enough to bring it into the trap. If it had withdrawn from the State the agency of Nash did not extend to receiving service in a suit upon a contract made and to be performed as this was. Chipman, Ltd., v. Thomas B. Jeffery Co., \n251 U.S. 373\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 172. The defendant relies upon the analogy of that case.\n The purpose in requiring the appointment of such an agent is primarily to secure local jurisdiction in respect of business transacted within the State. Of course when a foreign corporation appoints one as required by statute it \n\n[257 U.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n takes the risk of the construction that will be put upon the statute and the scope of the agency by the State Court. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., \n243 U.S. 93\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 344. But the reasons for a limited interpretation of a compulsory assent are hardly less strong when the assent is expressed by the appointment of an agent than when it is implied from going into business in the State without appointing one. In the later case the implication is limited to business transacted within the State. Simon v. Southern By. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115, 131\n, 132 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 255. Old Wayne Mutual Life Association v. McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8, 22\n, 23 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 236. Unless the state law either expressly or by local construction gives to the appointment a larger scope, we should not construe it to extend to suits in respect of business transacted by the foreign corporation elsewhere, at least if begun, as this was, when the long previous appointment of the agent is the only ground for imputing to the defendant an even technical presence. Chipman, Ltd., v. Thomas B. Jeffery Co., \n251 U.S. 373\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 172. The indications of the Ohio Statutes, so far as they go, look to 'liability incurred within this State.' Gen. Code,  181.

U S(1921)\nNo. 535\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 176, 177]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Welwood Murray, of New York City (Mr. Harrison Tweed, of New York City, on the brief), for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n Mr James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United states. \n\n[257 U.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were argued together, turn upon like facts, and may be disposed of in a single opinion. They involve the legality of certain income taxes assessed against the plaintiff in error in the one case, and against the testator of plaintiffs in error in the other, under the income tax provisions of the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, 167, by reason of certain distributions of corporate stocks received by the respective taxpayers under the following circumstances: In and prior to the year 1914, the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, a corporation of the state of Kansas, was engaged in producing, purchasing, and selling crude petroleum, and transporting it through pipe lines owned by the company in the states of Kansas and Oklahoma, and elsewhere. At the same time the Ohio Oil Company, a corporation of the state of Ohio, was engaged in producing and manufacturing petroleum and mineral oil and transporting the same through pipe lines owned by it in the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. In the month of June, 1914, it was judicially determined by this court (The Pipe Line Cases, \n234 U.S. 548\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 956), that with respect to the transportation business these companies were common carriers in interstate commerce, subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended by Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584 (Comp. St.  8563), and as such subject to the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission. By Act of September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717 (Comp. St.  8836a-8836k), the remainder of their business became subject to the supervision of the federal Trade Commission. In order to avoid a probable conflict of federal authority in case the combined business of production and transportation should continue to be carried on as theretofore, it was in each case, upon advice of counsel, determined that the pipe line property should be owned and operated by a separate corporation. In the \n\n[257 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n case of the Ohio company an added reason for segregation lay in the fact that by a section of the Ohio General Code its entire gross receipts, including those derived from business other than transportation, were subject to an annual assessment of 4 per cent. chargeable against the gross receipts of companies engaged in the transportation business. For these reasons, the stockholders of the Prairie Oil & Gas Company caused a corporation to be organized under the laws of the state of Kansas, by the name of the Prairie Pipe Line Company, to which all the pipe line property of the Prairie Oil & Gas Company was transferred in consideration of the issue and delivery of the entire capital stock of the new company, to be distributed pro rata to the stockholders of the Prairie Oil & Gas Company. And similarly, the stockholders of the Ohio Oil Company caused a corporation to be formed under the laws of that state, by the name of the Illinois Pipe Line Company, to which all the pipe line property of the Ohio Oil Company was transferred in consideration of the issue to it of the entire capital stock of the new company, which was to be distributed at once by the oil company to its stockholders pro rata. These arrangements were carried out in like manner in both cases, except that in the case of the Kansas companies the stock of the pipe line company was issued directly to the stockholders of the oil company, whereas in the case of the Ohio companies the pipe line company issued its stock to the oil company; but in the same resolution by which the contract was made, an immediate distribution of the new stock among the oil company's stockholders was provided for, and in fact it was carried out. The aggregate valuation of the Prairie pipe lines was $27,000,000, that of the Ohio pipe lines $20,000,000, and the total capitalization of the respective pipe line companies equalled these amounts.\n In each case, the oil company had a surplus in excess of the stated value of its pipe lines and of the par value of \n\n[257 U.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n the total stock of the corresponding pipe line company; so that the transfer of the pipe lines and the distribution of the stock received for them left the capital of the respective oil companies unimpaired and required no reduction in their outstanding issues.\n Messrs. Rockefeller and Harkness, respectively, were holders of large amounts of the stock of both the Prairie and the Ohio oil companies and in the distributions each received an amount of stock in each of the pipe line companies proportionate to his holdings in the oil companies. This occurred in the year 1915. Neither Mr. Rockefeller nor Mr. Harkness nor the latter's executors sold any of the stock in the pipe line companies.\n Income tax assessments for the year 1915 were imposed upon Messrs. Rockefeller and Harkness, based upon the value of the stocks thus received as dividends; and these assessments are in question in the present suits, both of which were brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York; one by the United States against Mr. Rockefeller, the other by the executors of Mr. Harkness against the Collector. In each case the facts were specially pleaded so as to present the question whether the distribution of the stocks of the pipe line companies among the stockholders of the oil companies constituted, under the circumstances, dividends within the meaning of the act of 1913, and income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. In each case a final judgment was rendered sustaining the assessment, and the judgments are brought here by direct writs of error under section 238, Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215), because of the constitutional question.\n Under the facts as recited we deem it to be too plain for dispute that in both cases the new pipe line company shares were in substance and effect distributed by the oil company to its stockholders; as much so in the case of the Kansas company, where the new stock went directly \n\n[257 U.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n from the pipe line company to the stockholders of the oil company, as in the case of the Ohio company, where the new stock went from the pipe line company to the oil company and by it was transferred to its stockholders. Looking to the substance of things the difference is unessential. In each case the consideration moved from the oil company in its corporate capacity; the new company's stock issued in exchange for it was distributed among the oil company's stockholders in their individual capacity, and was a substantial fruit of their ownership of stock in the oil company, in effect a dividend out of the accumulated surplus.\n The facts are in all essentials indistinguishable from those presented in United States v. Phellis, \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63, decided this day. In these cases, as in that, regarding the general effect of the entire transactions resulting from the combined action of the mass of stockholders, there was apparently little but a reorganization and financial readjustment of the affairs of the companies concerned, here a subdivision of companies, without immediate effect upon the personnel of the stockholders, of much difference in the aggregate corporate activities or properties. As in the Phellis Case, the adoption of the new arrangement did not of itself produce any increase of wealth to the stockholders, since whatever was gained by each in the value of his new pipe line stock was at the same moment withdrawn through a corresponding diminution of the value of his oil stock. Nevertheless the new stock represented assets of the oil companies standing in the place of the pipe line properties that before had constituted portions of their surplus assets, and it was capable of division among stockholders as the pipe line properties were not. The distribution, whatever its effect upon the aggregate interests of the mass of stockholders, constituted in the case of each individual a gain in the form of actual exchangeable assets transferred to him from the oil company \n\n[257 U.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n for his separate use in partial realization of his former indivisible and contingent interest in the corporate surplus. It was in substance and effect, not merely in form, a dividend of profits by the corporation, and individual income to the stockholder.\n The opinion just delivered in United States v. Phellis sufficiently indicates the grounds of our conclusion that the judgment in each of the present cases must be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUTLEDGE TIMBER CO. v.

Delany, instituted this proceeding in the United States District Court for Idaho to compel the appellants to hold certain lands, patented to the railway company, as trustee for him. The insistence is that patent should not have issued to the company, notwithstanding the attempt to make selection under the Act of March 2, 1899 (chapter 377, 30 Stat. 993 [Comp. St.  5223-5226]), prior to initiation of any homestead right in the land, because (1) it was then unsurveyed and not designated with reasonable certainty, and (2) it was within a district survey of which had been applied for by the state of Idaho under Act of August 18, 1894 (chapter 301, 28 Stat. 372, 394).\n The District Court decided both points in favor of appellants and dismissed the bill; the Circuit Court of Appeals held against them on the first but did not consider the second point. Farrell v. Edward Rutledge Timber Co., 258 Fed. 161, 169 C. C. A. 229.\n The facts pertinent to the first point are substantially the same as those presented by the record in West v. Rutledge Timber Co., \n244 U.S. 90\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 587, except that here the land \n\n[255 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n was 7 1\/2 miles from any known survey while there the distance was 3 1\/2 miles. The Land Department found the description sufficient for reasonable certainty and we see no adequate ground for disregarding that conclusion.\n As the district designated by Idaho for survey contained very much more land than the state was entitled to select, the Land Department refused to consider the application. No appeal was taken. Upon an analysis of pertinent statutes, opinions of the Land Department and of this court, the District Court held that the mere filing of application for survey did not so far withdraw the land from the public domain as to make the railway's selection wholly ineffective; and further, that if valid for any purpose, the application merely gave an option to select, never exercised in respect of the land now in dispute. We agree with the conclusion reached; and in view of the careful supporting opinion further discussion seems unnecessary.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the decree of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v.

As agreed and provided by the laws of the two states, the rights, privileges, franchises, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts on every account, as well as stock subscriptions and other things in action belonging to each of the constituents, were transferred to and vested in the consolidated corporation without further act or deed, 'as effectually as they were in the former companies.'\n Section 3477 has been before this court many times for construction and application.

It was intended to prevent frauds upon the Treasury, and the mischiefs designed to be remedied 'are mainly tow: First, the danger that the rights of the government might be embarrassed by having to deal with several persons instead of one and by the introduction of a party who was a stranger to the original transaction. Second, that by a transfer of such a claim against the government to one or more persons not originally interested in it, the way might be conveniently opened to such improper influences in prosecuting the claim before the departments, the courts, or the Congress, as desperate cases, when the reward is contingent on success, so often suggest.'\n We cannot believe that Congress intended to discourage, hinder or obstruct the orderly merger or consolidation of corporations as the various states might authorize for the public interest. There is no probability that the United States could suffer injury in respect of outstanding claims from such union of interests and certainly the result would not be more deleterious than would follow their passing to heirs, devisees, assignees in bankruptcy, or receivers, all of which changes of ownership have been declared without the ambit of the statute. The same principle which required the exceptions heretofore approved applies here.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded with direction to afford reasonable opportunity to both sides for taking any additional proof rendered necessary by the withdrawal by the United States of a stipulation upon which reliance had been placed, and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSILVER KING COALITION MINES CO. v.

Thereupon a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n250 U.S. 655\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 13. A short statement will be enough to present the single issue that it is necessary to pass upon here. The only ground upon which the Conkling Mining Company stands is that the ore is within the lines of its patent extended vertically downward. If the patent properly construed does not cover the land in question the case is at an end.\n The patent under which the Conkling Mining Company gets its title was granted to the Boss Mining Company and so far as material is as follows: It recites that in pursuance of the Revised Statutes, etc., there have been deposited in the General Land Office of the United States the plat and field notes of survey and the Certificate No. 1697 of the Register of the local land office with other evidence whereby it appears that the grantee duly entered and paid for that certain mining claim known as the Conkling lode mining claim, designated by the Surveyor General as Lot No. 689, 'bounded, described, and platted as follows ...

'Thence second course, south sixty degrees and forty-five minutes west one thousand five hundred feet to corner No. 3. Thence third course, south twenty-one degrees and nine minutes east six hundred feet to corner No. 4.' It then grants 'the said mining premises hereinbefore described' and all that portion of veins, lodes or ledges, 'the tops or apexes of which lie inside of the surface boundary lines of said granted premises in said Lot No. 689,' etc., with a proviso confining 'the right of possession to such outside parts of said veins,' etc., 'to such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes drawn downward through the end lines of said Lot No. 689,' etc.\n If 'corner No. 3' and 'corner No. 4' are determined by courses and distances alone the Conkling Mining Company is entitled to prevail upon the question that we are discussing. The Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion that the patent represented an adjudication by the Land Department that the lot was 1500 feet long and 600 feet wide without regard to the location of the other posts which the field notes showed to exist but the patent did not mention. The District Court on the other hand held that evidence was admissible to show that there were monuments at corners No. 3 and No. 4, held that the monuments so established prevailed, and therefore decided that the title of the Conkling Mining Company failed.\n The decree of the District Court appears to us to be supported by the face of the patent and by consideration of the circumstances. If a draughtsman were determining his description by courses and distances only it seems unlikely that he would insert 'corner No. 3' and 'corner No. 4' where the direction changed, as it would add nothing to the change of direction in the boundary line. The \n\n[255 U.S. 151, 161]\n\u00a0\n words by themselves suggest a reference to an external object, an interpretation greatly strengthened by the fact that the same phrase in the first two instances of its use referred to one in terms; and coupled with evidence that such an external object was found, the words at least tend to prove that a monument was meant. Of course evidence is admissible, if needed, to show that language is to receive the interpretation that taken by itself it invites. Furthermore the grant is of 'the said mining premises hereinbefore described,' assumed in the same sentence to be the lot designated by the Surveyor General as Lot No. 689; and, when it is observed that it is the duty of the Surveyor General to see that the lot is identified by monuments on the ground the presumption becomes almost irresistible that 'corner No. 3' and 'corner No. 4' mean corners determined as they are required to be determined by the law.\n One statutory foundation of a mining claim is that 'the location must be distinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced.' Rev. Sts.  2324 (Comp. St.  4620). To obtain a patent the claimant must file in the proper land office along with his application 'a plat and field notes of the claim ... made by or under the direction of the United States Surveyor General, showing accurately the boundaries of the claim ... which shall be distinctly marked by monuments on the ground.' Waskey v. Hammer, \n223 \nU.S. 85, 92\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 187. He also must file a certificate of the Surveyor General 'that the plat is correct, with such further description by such reference to natural objects or permanent monuments as shall identify the claim, and furnish an accurate description, to be incorporated in the patent.' Rev. Sts.  2325 (Comp. St.  4622). It is the reference to natural objects or monuments that is to be incorporated. Before the application is filed notice of it must be posted on the ground. The register subsequently advertises the application in a newspaper, \n\n[255 U.S. 151, 162]\n\u00a0\n etc., and if no adverse claim is made and the other conditions are complied with the patent is granted. The notice is jurisdictional. El Paso Brick Co. v. McKnight, \n233 \nU.S. 250, 259\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 498, L. R. A. 1915A, 1113. Obviously therefore a patent can convey only the claim as to which notice has been given. A notice of an application for a patent of land determined by monuments cannot give priority to a junior location, such as was that of the Conkling Mining Company, in respect of land outside the monuments, to which adjoining claimants had no notice that the patent would purport to extend.\n The final receipt from the local land officer fixed the claimant's rights. El Paso Brick Co. v. McKnight, \n233 \nU.S. 250, 257\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 498, L. R. A. 1915A, 1113. The failure of the subsequent patent to the Boss Mining Company, issued February 23, 1892, to describe the monuments at corners Nos. 3 and 4 was not an adjudication in favor of an inconsistent description but simply the following of a practice of abbreviating by omission that had been adopted by the land office in 1891, and which a few years later it was directed to discard. The act of April 28, 1904, c. 1796, 33 Stat. 545, amending Rev. Sts.  2327 (Comp. St.  4626), making the monuments the highest authority to which inconsistent descriptions must give way, simply made more explicit or at most carried a little farther the previous policy of the law. We are satisfied that evidence that the field notes, as the regulations of the department required, showed marked posts at the third and fourth corners was admissible, and that witnesses properly were allowed to testify that they found posts upon the ground. The District Judge who saw and heard the witnesses was satisfied that they told the truth and thereupon rightly determined that the monuments so fixed controlled the courses and distances in the instrument evidencing the grant.

CONKLING MINING CO(1921)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n Conkling Mining Co \n256 U.S. 18\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[256 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the respondent to establish its right to a large body of ore found within the lines of the respondent's patent as it construed that document. The main contest concerned the southwesterly 135. 5 feet of the patent as laid out by courses and distances, from which was taken the main body of the ore. At the argument the petitioner's statement was that 'practically all the ore in controversy was taken from within this 135.5 foot strip.' \n\n[256 U.S. 18, 25]\n\u00a0\n The decision with regard to that strip was in favor of the petitioner and as it seemed possible that the respondent would not be able to establish that any appreciable amount of ore was taken from the land belonging to it, and that it might not care to attempt the proof, the questions raised with regard to such ore if any were left undecided according to the usual practice. But the respondent points out that the petitioner has admitted that a small amount of ore, not exceeding $20,047.50 in value, did come from the respondent's land and presses for a decision concerning its right to that. The motion is put in the form of a petition for rehearing; but the main thing asked and the only thing for which we see any reason is that we decide the questions argued, but left open by us. That we proceed to do. Nothing that has been decided will be reopened, but leave to file the petition is granted to that single end.\n It is not disputed by the respondent, the Conkling Mining Company, that a fissure on its strike crosses the parallel side lines of the petitioner's claims and on its dip passes beneath the Conkling mining claim in the immediate vicinity of the ore body in dispute and between vertical planes drawn through the parallel side lines of the petitioner's claims and continued in their own direction. What is disputed is that this ore body is any part of the vein referred to, known as the Crescent Fissure, and that, if it is, the petitioner has any right to treat the end lines of its claims as side lines and to pursue the vein under ground beyond the vertical planes drawn through those lines.\n We take up the last question first. The typical case supposed by Rev. Sts.  2322 (Comp. St.  4618) is that of a claim laid out lengthwise along the strike of a vein. In that case the end lines of the location will limit the extralateral right. But that case is only the simplest illustration of a principle. The general purpose is to give a right to all of the vein \n\n[256 U.S. 18, 26]\n\u00a0\n INCLUDED IN THE SURFACE LINES, IF THERE is only one, provided the apex is within the location. It often must happen that the strike of the vein is not known but must be conjectured at the time of discovery, and that the location is across instead of along the vein. This has been obvious always and therefore it would be wrong to interpret the words 'end lines' narrowly, as meaning the shorter ones in every instance. Those are the end lines that cut across the strike of the vein if it crosses the location. We see no sufficient reason for thinking that because the discoverer has not claimed as long a portion of the strike as he might have, he should be deprived of even his diminished lateral rights. It has been the accepted opinion of this Court for many years that where as here the strike of the vein crosses the location at right angles its dip may be followed extralaterally, whatever the direction in which the length of the location may run. If across the strike as here, the side lines, as it commonly is expressed, become the end lines. Subsequent locators know as well as the original ones that the determining fact is the direction of the strike not the first discover's guess. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co. v. Tarbet, \n98 U.S. 463\n; King v. Amy & Silversmith Consolidated Mining Co., \n152 \nU.S. 222, 228\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 510. Del Monte Mining & Milling Co. v. Last Chance Mining & Milling Co., \n171 \nU.S. 55, 90\n, 91 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 895; Jim Butler Tonopah Mining Co. v. West End Consolidated Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 574\n\n\n But it is said that when the end lines are determined they are end lines for all purposes even if there are different veins running in different directions having their apexes within the claim. Walrath v. Champion Mining Co., \n171 U.S. 293\n, 18 SUP. CT. 909, 43 l. ed. 170. and it is argued that there is a presumption that has not been overcome that there was a discovery vein running parallel with the side lines; that this determined the end lines and that therefore the petitioner got no extralateral rights in the Crescent Fissure. The Circuit \n\n[256 U.S. 18, 27]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals, approaching the petitioner's claim as a claim of an exceptional privilege, seems to have attached a weightier burden of proof to it than we are disposed to do. They were not satisfied that the discovery vein which determined what the end lines should be was not some other vein than the Crescent Fissure. But we see no substantial evidence that there was another vein. We have the distinct testimony of experts that there was no such and we agree with the view of the District Judge sustaining the petitioner's extralateral rights. Whether there are other answers to the contention we need not decide. See Jim Butler Tonopah Mining Co. v. West End Consolidated Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 450, 454\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 574, et seq.\n It is urged that if the end lines be taken as the side lines then the discovery shafts being four hundred feet distant from the apex of the Crescent Fissure left either the vein or the discovery outside the location with the side lines limited as they should be. But at that time there was no requirement making a discovery shaft essential to a valid location. And in any event our conclusion being that the petitioner must be presumed to have discovered the Crescent Fissure, however it may have been done, the distance of the shafts does not affect the case.\n The only question that remains is whether the ore within the respondent's lines formed part of the Crescent Fissure vein. The Circuit Court of Appeals in view of its opinion upon the last point made no decision upon this. But the experienced District Judge after careful consideration was of the opinion that the ore belonged to the vein. We see nothing to convince us that he was wrong. The position of the respondent is that the ore in controversy is a distinct bedded deposit. But as the District Judge remarks, similar deposits are found at many different horizons, connected with the fissure and similar in composition to the ore in the fissure. The deposit in question was like the others. Whether we consider merely the \n\n[256 U.S. 18, 28]\n\u00a0\n practical fact of the continuously occurring deposits along the course of the vein or the theory of their origin which seems to us the most probable, we believe the District Judge to have been right.\n Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Decree of District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMIETANKA v. INDIANA STEEL CO(1921)\nNo. 214\nArgued: October 14, 1921Decided: October 24, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for Smietanka.\n William Beye, of Chicago, Ill., for Indiana Steel Co.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought to recover internal revenue special excise taxes for the years 1910 and 1912, assessed under the Act of Congress of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, and paid by the plaintiff, the defendant in error, under duress. The taxes were collected by S. M. Fitch, then collector of internal revenue, and it was certified by the District Court as part of its judgment that there was probable cause for the act of the collector, that he acted under the direction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and that the amounts recovered should be provided for and paid out of the proper appropriation from the Treasury of the United States. The defendant is the present collector for what was Fitch's district and was held liable by this judgment. The case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals which has certified the following questions:\n'1. Assuming that the declaration states a good cause of action had the suit been brought against S. M. Fitch, the internal revenue collector who actually collected and received the taxes, does it state any cause of action whatever against said S. M. Fitch's successor in office, the plaintiff in error, against whom the suit was brought, but who had no participation in the collection, receipt or disbursement of such taxes? \n\n[257 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. May suit in the District Court of the United States properly be brought and maintained against a United States collector of internal revenue for the recovery of the amount of a United States internal revenue tax, unlawfully assessed and collected, but in the collection and disbursement of which such collector had no agency, the entire transaction of such assessment, collection and disbursement having occurred during the incumbency of such office of a predecessor in office of such collector?'\n\n\n As the law stood before later statutes a collector was liable personally for duties mistakenly collected, if the person charged gave notice, at the time, of his intention to sue, and warning not to pay over the amount to the Treasury. Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137. But after an Act of Congress had required collectors to pay over such monies, it was held, against the dissent of Mr. Justice Story, that the personal liability was gone. Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236. Later statutes however recognize suits against collectors in such cases, and the plaintiff contends that they should be construed to create a new statutory liability attached to the office and passing to successors, as was held in this case, the formal defendant being saved from harm by the United States. This however is not the language of the statutes and hardly can be reconciled with the decision of this Court in Sage v. United States, \n250 U.S. 33\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 415, and other cases to which we shall refer.\n To show that the action still is personal, as laid down in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 415, it would seem to be enough to observe that when the suit is begun it cannot be known with certainty that the judgment will be paid out of the Treasury. That depends upon the certificate of the Court in the case. It is not to be supposed that a stranger to an unwarranted transaction is made answerable for it; yet that might be the result of the suit if it could be brought against a successor to the collector \n\n[257 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n ship. A personal execution is denied only when the certificate is given. It is true that in this instance the certificate has been made, but the intended scope of the action must be judged by its possibilities under the statutes that deal with it. The language of the most material enactment, Rev. St.  989 (Comp. St.  1635), gives no countenance to the plaintiff's argument. It enacts that no execution shall issue against the collector but that the amount of the judgment shall 'be provided for and paid out of the proper appropriation from the Treasury,' when and only when the Court certifies to either of the facts certified here, and 'when a recovery is had in any suit or proceedings against a collector or other officer of the revenue for any act done by him, or for the recovery of any money exacted by or paid to him and by him paid into the Treasury, in the performance of his official duty.' A recovery for acts done by the defendant is the only one contemplated by the words 'by him.' The same is true of Rev. St.  771 , (Comp. St.  1296), requiring District Attorneys to defend such suits.\n No different conclusion results from the Act of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822 (Comp. St.  1594). That is a general provision that a suit by or 'against an officer of the United States in his official capacity' should not abate by reason of his death, or the expiration of his term of office, etc., but that the Court upon motion within twelve months showing the necessity for the survival of the suit to obtain a settlement of the question involved, may allow the same to be maintained by or against his successor in office. Whether this would apply to a suit of the present kind is at least doubtful. Roberts v. Lowe (D. C.) 236 Fed. 604, 605. In Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 493, a suit against a collector begun after the passage of this statute, it was held that it could be revived against his executrix, which shows again that the action is personal; as also does the fact that the collector may be held liable for interest. Erskine v. Van \n\n[257 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Arsdale, 15 Wall. 75. Redfield v. Bartels, \n139 U.S. 694\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 683.

St.  9835a-9835z), as amended by Act Jan. 18, 1918, 40 Stat. 431 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9835w).\n The relief was sought on the ground that these acts were beyond the constitutional power of Congress. The bill avers that the board of directors of the company are \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 196]\n\u00a0\n about to invest its funds in the bonds to the amount of $10,000 in each of the classes described, and will do so unless enjoined by the court in this action. The bill avers the formation of 12 Federal Land Banks, and 21 Joint-Stock Land Banks under the provisions of the act.\n As to the Federal Land Banks, it is averred that each of them has loaned upon farm lands large amounts secured by mortgage, and, after depositing the same with the Farm Loan Registrar, has executed and issued collateral trust obligations, called 'farm loan bonds,' secured by the depositing of an equivalent amount of farm mortgages and notes, and that each of said Federal Land Banks has sold, and is continuing to offer for sale, large amounts of said farm loan bonds. The bill also avers that various persons in different parts of the United States have organized 21 Joint-Stock Land Banks the capital stock of which is subscribed for and owned by private persons; that the Joint-Stock Land Banks have deposited notes and mortgages with the Farm Loan Registrar, and issued an equivalent amount of collateral trust obligations called 'farm loan bonds,' which have been sold and will be continued to be offered for sale to investors in large amounts in the markets of the country. A statement is given of the amount of deposits by the Secretary of the Treasury with the Federal Land Banks, for which the banks have issued their certificates of indebtedness bearing interest at 2 per cent. per annum. It is averred that on September 30, 1919, Federal Land Banks owned United States bouds of the par value of $4,230,805, and the Joint-Stock Land Banks owned like bonds of the par value of $3,287,503 on August 31, 1919; that pursuant to the provisions of the act the Secretary of the Treasury has invested $8,892, 130 of the public funds in the capital stock of the Federal Land Banks, and that on July 1, 1919, the Secretary of the Treasury, on behalf of the United States, held $8,265,809 of the capital stock of the Federal Land Banks; \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 197]\n\u00a0\n that pursuant to the provisions of section 32 of the act as amended, the Secretary of the Treasury has purchased farm loan bonds issued by the Federal Land Banks of the par value of $149,775,000; that up to September 30, 1919, bonds have been issued under the act by the Federal Land Banks to the amount of $285,600,000, of which about $135,000,000 are held in the Treasury of the United States purchased under the authority of the amendment of January 19, 1918; that up to September 30, 1919, 27 Joint- Stock Land Banks have been incorporated under the act, having an aggregate capital of $8,000,000, all of which has been subscribed, and $7,450,000 paid in; that bonds have been issued by Joint-Stock Land Banks to the amount of $41,000,000, which are now in the hands of the public; that the Secretary of the Treasury up to the time of the filing of the bill has not designated any of the Federal Land Banks nor the Joint-Stock Land Banks as depositaries of public money nor, except as stated later in the bill, has he employed them or any of them as financial agents of the government, nor have they or any of them performed any duties as depositaries of public money, nor have they or any of them accepted any deposits or engaged in any banking business. The bill avers that during the summer of 1918 the Federal Land Banks at Wichita, St. Paul, and Spokane were designated as financial agents of the government for making seed grain loans to farmers in drought-stricken sections; the President having at the request of the Secretary of Agriculture set aside $5,000,000 for that purpose out of the $ 100,000,000 war funds. The three banks mentioned made upwards of 15,000 loans of that character aggregating a sum upwards of $4,500,000, and are now engaged in collecting these loans all of which are secured by crop liens; that these banks act in that capacity without compensation, receiving only the actual expenses incurred.\n Section 27 of the act provides that farm loan bonds \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 198]\n\u00a0\n issued under the provisions of the act by Federal Land Banks or Joint- Stock Land Banks shall be a lawful investment for all fiduciary and trust funds, and may be accepted as security for all public deposits. The bill avers that the defendant Trust Company is authorized to buy, invest in and sell government, state and municipal and other bonds, but it cannot buy, invest in or sell any such bonds, papers, stocks or securities which are not authorized to be issued by a valid law or which are not investment securities, but that nevertheless it is about to invest in farm loan bonds; that the Trust Company has been induced to direct its officers to make the investment by reason of its reliance upon the provisions of the Farm Loan Acts, especially sections 21, 26 and 27, by which the farm loan bonds are declared to be instrumentalities of the government of the United States, and as such, with the income derived therefrom, are declared to be exempt from federal, state, municipal and local taxation, and are further declared to be lawful investments for all fiduciary and trust funds. The bill further avers that the acts by which it is attempted to authorize the bonds are wholly illegal, void and unconstitutional, and of no effect, because unauthorized by the Constitution of the United States.\n The bill prays that the acts of Congress authorizing the creation of the banks, especially sections 26 and 27 thereof, shall be adjudged and decreed to be unconstitutional, void and of no effect, and that the issuance of the farm loan bonds, and the taxation exemption feature thereof, shall be adjudged and decreed to be invalid.\n The First Joint-Stock Land Bank of Chicago and the Federal Land Bank of Wichita, Kan., were allowed to intervene and became parties defendant to the suit. The Kansas City Title & Trust Company filed a motion to dismiss in the nature of a general demurrer, and upon hearing the District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill. From this decree appeal was taken to this court. \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 199]\n\u00a0\n No objection is made to the federal jurisdiction, either original or appellate, by the parties to this suit, but that question will be first examined. The company is authorized to invest its funds in legal securities only. The attack upon the proposed investment in the bonds described is because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the acts of Congress undertaking to organize the banks and authorize the issue of the bonds. No other reason is set forth in the bill as a ground of objection to the proposed investment by the board of directors acting in the company's behalf. As diversity of citizenship is lacking, the jurisdiction of the District Court depends upon whether the cause of action set forth arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Judicial Code ,  24 (Comp. St.  991).\n The general rule is that, where it appears from the bill or statement of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable, and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has jurisdiction under this provision.\n At an early date, considering the grant of constitutional power to confer jurisdiction upon the federal courts, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'A case in law or equity consists of the right of the one party, as well as of the other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitution or a law of the United States, whenever its correct decision depends upon the construction of either,' Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 379 (5 L. Ed. 257); and again, when 'the title or right set up by the party, may be defeated by one construction of the Constitution or law of the United States, and sustained by the opposite construction.'

Union Pacific Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, in which a shareholder filed a bill to enjoin the defendant corporation from complying with the income tax provisions of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913. In that case, while there was diversity of citizenship, a direct appeal to this court was sustained because of the constitutional questions raised in the bill, which had been dismissed by the court below. The repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, as well as grounds of equitable jurisdiction were set forth in the bill, and the right to come here on direct appeal was sustained because of the averments based upon constitutional objections to the act. Reference was made to Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673, where a similar shareholder's right to sue was maintained, and a direct appeal to this court from a decree of the Circuit Court was held to be authorized.\n In the Brushaber Case the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said:\n'The right to prevent the corporation from returning and paying the tax was based upon many averments as to the repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, of the peculiar relation of the corporation to the stockholders and their particualr interests resulting from many of the administrative provisions of the assailed act, of the confusion, wrong and multiplicity of suits and the absence of all means of redress which would result if the corporation paid the tax and complied with the act in other respects without protest, as it was alleged it was its intention to do. To put out of the way a question of jurisdiction, we at once say that in view of these averments and \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 201]\n\u00a0\n the ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, \n157 U.S. 429\n, sustaining the right of a stockholder to sue to restrain a corporation under proper averments from voluntarily paying a tax charged to be unconstitutional on the ground that to permit such a suit did not violate the prohibitions of section 3224, Rev. Stat., against enjoining the enforcement of taxes, we are of opinion that the contention here made that there was no jurisdiction of the cause since to entertain it would violate the provisions of the Revised Statutes referred to is without merit. ...\n\n'Aside from averments as to citizenship and residence, recitals as to the provisions of the statute and statements as to the business of the corporation contained in the first 10 paragraphs of the bill advanced to sustain jurisdiction, the bill alleged 21 constitutional objections specified in that number of paragraphs or subdivisions. As all the grounds assert a violation of the Constitution, it follows that in a wide sense they all charge a repugnancy of the statute to the Sixteenth Amendment under the more immediate sanction of which the statute was adopted.'\n\n The jurisdiction of this court is to be determined upon the principles laid down in the cases referred to. In the instant case the averments of the bill show that the directors were proceeding to make the investments in view of the act authorizing the bonds about to be purchased, maintaining that the act authorizing them was constitutional and the bonds valid and desirable investments. The objecting shareholder avers in the bill that the securities were issued under an unconstitutional law, and hence of no validity. It is therefore apparent that the controversy concerns the constitutional validity of an act of Congress which is directly drawn in question. The decision depends upon the determination of this issue.\n The general allegations as to the interest of the shareholder, and his right to have an injunction to prevent the purchase of the alleged unconstitutional securities by mis application \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 202]\n\u00a0\n of the funds of the corporation, gives jurisdiction under the principles settled in Pollock v. Trust Company and Brushaber v. Union Pacific Company, supra. We are therefore of the opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction under the averments of the bill and that a direct appeal to this court upon constitutional grounds is authorized.\n We come to examine the questions presented by the attack upon the constitutionality of the legislation in question. The Federal Farm Loan Act is too lengthy to set out in full. It is entitled:\n'An act to provide capital for agricultural development, to create standard forms of investment based upon farm mortgage, to equalize rates of interest upon farm loans, to furnish a market for United States bonds, to create government depositaries and financial agents for the United States, and for other purposes.'\n\n The administration of the act is placed under the direction and control of a Federal Farm Loan Bureau established at the seat of government in the Treasury Department, under the general supervision of the Federal Loan Board, consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury and four members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The United States is divided into 12 districts for the purpose of establishing Federal Land Banks. Each of the banks must have a subscribed capital of not less than $750,000, divided into shares of $5.00 each, which may be subscribed for by any individual, firm or corporation, or by the government of any state, or of the United States. No dividends shall be paid on the stock owned by the United States, but all other stock shall share in dividend distributions without preference. The Federal Farm Loan Board is to designate five directors who shall temporarily manage the affairs of each Federal Land Bank, and who shall prepare an organization certificate, which, when approved by the Federal Farm Loan Board and filed with the Farm Loan Commissioner, \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 203]\n\u00a0\n shall operate to create the bank a body corporate. The Federal Farm Loan Board is required to open books of subscription for the capital stock of each Federal Land Bank, and if within 30 days thereafter any part of the minimum capitalization of $750,000 of any such bank shall remain unsubscribed, it is made the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe the balance on behalf of the United States.\n The amendment of January 18, 1918, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase bonds issued by Federal Land Banks, and provides that the temporary organization of any such bank shall be continued so long as any farm loan bonds shall be held by the Treasury, and until the subscription to stock in such bank by National Farm Loan Associations shall equal the amount of the stock held by the United States government. When these conditions are complied with a permanent organization is to take over the management of the bank, consisting of a board of directors composed of nine members, three of whom shall be known as district directors and shall be appointed by the Farm Loan Board, who shall represent the public interest, six of whom to be known as local directors, shall be chosen by and be representative of national farm loan associations.\n Federal Land Banks are empowered to invest their funds in the purchase of qualified first mortgages on farm lands situated within the Federal Land Bank district within which they are organized or acting. Loans on farm mortgages are to be made to co-operative borrowers through the organization of corporations known as National Farm Loan Associations, by persons desiring to borrow money on farm mortgage security under the terms of the act. Ten or more natural persons, who are the owners of or are about to become the owners of farm land qualified as security for mortgage loans, and who desire to borrow money on farm mortgage security, may unite to form a National Farm \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 204]\n\u00a0\n Loan Association. The manner of forming these associations, and the qualifications for membership, are set out in the act.\n A loan desired by each such person must be for not more than $10,000 nor less than $100, and the aggregate of the desired loans not less than $ 20,000. The application for loan must be accompanied by subscriptions to stock of a Federal Land Bank equal to 5% of the aggregate sum desired on the mortgage loan. Provision is made for appraisal of the land, and report to the Federal Farm Loan Board. No persons but borrowers on farm loan mortgages shall be members or shareholders of National Farm Loan Associations.\n Shareholders in Farm Loan Associations are made individually responsible for the debts of the association to the extent of the amount of the stock owned by them respectively, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.\n When any National Farm Loan Association shall desire to secure for any member a loan on first mortgage from the Federal Land Bank in its district, it must subscribe to the capital stock of the Federal Land Bank to an amount of 5 per cent. of such loan, which capital stock shall be held by the Federal Land Bank as collateral security for the payment of the loan, the association shall be paid any dividends accruing and payable on the capital stock while it is outstanding. Such stock may, in the discretion of the directors and with the approval of the Federal Farm Loan Board, be paid off at par and retired, and shall be so retired upon the full payment of the mortgage loan. In such event, the National Farm Loan Association must pay off at par and retire the corresponding shares of its stock which were issued when the Land Bank stock so retired was issued; but it is further provided that the capital stock of the Land Bank shall not be reduced to less than 5 per cent. of the principal of the outstanding farm \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 205]\n\u00a0\n loan bonds issued by it. The shares in National Farm Loan Associations shall be of the par value of $5 each.\n At least 25 per cent. of that part of the capital of any Federal Land Bank for which stock is outstanding in the name of National Farm Loan Associations must be held in quick assets. Not less than 5 per cent. of such capital must be invested in United States government bonds.\n The loans which Federal Land Banks may make upon first mortgages on farm lands are provided for in section 12 of the act. By section 13 these banks are empowered, subject to the provisions of the act, to issue and sell farm loan bonds of the kind described in the act, and to invest funds in their possession in qualified first mortgages on farm lands, to receive and to deposit in trust with the Farm Loan registrar, to be held by him as collateral security for farm loan bonds, first mortgages upon farm lands, and, with the approval of the Farm Loan Board, to issue and to sell their bonds secured by the deposit of first mortgages on qualified farm lands as collateral in conformity with the provisions of section 18 of the act. By the amendment of January 18, 1918, the Secretary of the Treasury was empowered during the years 1918 and 1919, to purchase farm loan bonds issued by Federal Land Banks to an amount not exceeding $100,000,000 each year, and any Federal Land Bank was authorized at any time to repurchase at par and accrued interest, for the purpose of redemption or resale, any of the bonds so purchased from it and held in the United States Treasury.\n It is also provided that the bonds of any Federal Land Bank so purchased and held in the Treasury one year after the termination of the pending war shall, upon 30 days' notice from the Secretary of the Treasury, be redeemed and repurchased by such bank at par and accrued interest. By section 15 it is provided that whenever, after the act shall have been in effect for one year, it shall appear to the Federal Farm Loan Board that National Farm Loan \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 206]\n\u00a0\n Associations have not been formed and are not likely to be formed, in any locality, because of peculiar local conditions, the board may in its discretion authorize Federal Land Banks to make loans on farm lands through agents approved by the board, on the terms and conditions and subject to the restrictions prescribed in that section.\n The act also authorizes the incorporation of Joint-Stock Land Banks, with capital provided by private subscription. They are organized by not less than 10 natural persons, and are subject to the requirements of the provisions of section 4 of the act so far as applicable. The board of directors shall consist of not less than five members. Each shareholder shall have the same voting privileges as the holders of shares in National Banking Associations, and shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such bank to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares. The Joint-Stock Land Bank is authorized to do business when capital stock to the amount of $250,000 has been subscribed, and one-half paid in cash, the balance remaining subject to call by the board of directors, the charter to be issued by the Federal Farm Loan Board. No bonds shall be issued until the capital stock is entirely paid up. Except as otherwise provided, Joint-Stock Land Banks shall have the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions and conditions imposed on Federal Land Banks by the act, so far as such conditions or restrictions are applicable.\n Federal Land Banks may issue Farm Loan Bonds up to 20 times their capital and surplus. Joint-Stock Land Banks are limited to the issue of Farm Loan Bonds not in excess of 15 times the amount of their capital and surplus. Joint-Stock Land Banks can only loan on first mortgages upon land in the state where located, or in a state \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 207]\n\u00a0\n contiguous thereto. No loan on mortgage may be made by any bank at a rate exceeding 6 per cent. per annum exclusive of amortization payments. Joint- Stock Land Banks shall in no case charge a rate of interest on farm loans which shall exceed by more than 1 per cent. the rate extablished by the last series of farm loan bonds issued by them, which rate shall not exceed 5 per cent. per annum.\n Provisions for the issue of farm loan bonds secured by first mortgages on farm lands or United States bonds, as collateral, are made for Federal Land Banks and Joint-Stock Land Banks; in each case the issue is made subject to the approval of the Federal Farm Loan Board. The farm loan mortgages, or United States bonds, which constitute the collateral security for the bonds must be deposited with the Farm Loan Registrar.\n Section 26 of the act provides as follows:\n'That every Federal Land Bank and every National Farm Loan Association, including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from federal, state, municipal, and local taxation, except taxes upon real estate held, purchased, or taken by said bank or association under the provisions of section eleven and section thirteen of this act. First mortgages executed to Federal Land Banks, or to Joint-Stock Land Banks, and farm loan bonds issued under the provisions of this act, shall be deemed and held to be instrumentalities of the government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from federal, state, municipal, and local taxation.\n\n'Nothing herein shall prevent the shares in any Joint-Stock Land Bank from being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the state within which the bank is located; but such assessment and taxation shall be in manner and subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section fifty-two \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 208]\n\u00a0\n hundred and nineteen of the Revised Statutes with reference to the shares of national banking associations.\n\n'Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the real property of Federal and Joint-Stock Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations from either state, county or municipal taxes; to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed.'\n\n Since the decision of the great cases of McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, and Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, it is no longer an open question that Congress may establish banks for national purposes, only a small part of the capital of which is held by the government, and a majority of the ownership in which is represented by shares of capital stock privately owned and held; the principal business of such banks being private banking conducted with the usual methods of such business. While the express power to create a bank or incorporate one is not found in the Constitution, the court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, in McCulloch v. Maryland, found authority so to do in the broad general powers conferred by the Constitution upon the Congress to levy and collect taxes, to borrow money, to regulate commerce, to pay the public debts, to declare and conduct war, to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain a navy, etc. Congress it was held had authority to use such means as were deemed appropriate to exercise the great powers of the government by virtue of article 1, section 8, clause 18, of the Constitution, granting to Congress the right to make all laws necessary and proper to make the grant effectual. In First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 \nU.S. 416, 419\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169, the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, after reviewing McCulloch v. Maryland and Osborn v. Bank, and considering the power given to Congress to pass laws to make the specific powers granted effectual, said:\n'In terms it was pointed out that this broad authority \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 209]\n\u00a0\n was not stereotyped as of any particular time, but endured, thus furnishing a perpetual and living sanction to the legislative authority within the limits of a just discretion enabling it to take into consideration the changing wants and demands of society and to adopt provisions appropriate to meet every situation which it was deemed required to be provided for.'\n\n That the formation of the bank was required in the judgment of the Congress for the fiscal operations of the government was a principal consideration upon which Chief Justice Marshall rested the authority to create the bank; and for that purpose being an appropriate measure in the judgment of the Congress, it was held not to be within the authority of the court to question the conclusion reached by the legislative branch of the government.\n Upon the authority of McCulloch v. Maryland and Osborn v. Bank the national banking system was established, and upon them this court has rested the constitutionality of the legislation establishing such banks. Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29, 33\n, 34 S..\n Congress has seen fit in section 6 of the act to make both classes of banks, when designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury, depositaries of public money, except receipts from customs, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and has authorized their employment as financial agents of the government, and the banks are required to perform such reasonable duties, as depositaries of public moneys and financial agents as may be required of them. The Secretary of the Treasury shall require of the Federal Land Banks and the Joint-Stock Land Banks, thus designated, satisfactory security, by the deposit of United States bonds or otherwise, for the safe-keeping and prompt payment of the public money deposited with them, and \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 210]\n\u00a0\n for the faithful performance of their duties as the financial agents of the government.\n Section 6 also provides that no government funds deposited under the provisions of the section shall be invested in mortgage loans or farm loan bonds.\n It is said that the power to designate these banks as such depositaries has not been exercised by the government, and that the Federal Land Banks have acted as federal agents only in the case of loans of money for seed purposes made in the summer of 1918, to which we have already referred. But the existence of the power under the Constitution is not determined by the extent of the exercise of the authority conferred under it. Congress declared it necessary to create these fiscal agencies, and to make them authorized depositaries of public money. Its power to do so is no longer open to question.\n But, it is urged, the attempt to create these federal agencies, and to make these banks fiscal agents and public depositaries of the government, is but a pretext. But nothing is better settled by the decisions of this court than that, when Congress acts within the limits of its constitutional authority, it is not the province of the judicial branch of the government to question its motives. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541; McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 147\n, 153 S., 156, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312 and cases cited.\n That Congress has seen fit, in making of these banks fiscal agencies and depositaries of public moneys, to grant to them banking powers of a limited character, in no wise detracts from the authority of Congress to use them for the governmental purposes named, if it sees fit to do so. A bank may be organized with or without the authority to issue currency. It may be authorized to receive deposits in only a limited way. Speaking generally, a bank is a moneyed institution to facilitate the borrowing, lending and caring for money. But whether \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 211]\n\u00a0\n technically banks, or not, these organizations may serve the governmental purposes declared by Congress in their creation. Furthermore, these institutions are organized to serve as a market for United States Bonds. Not less than 5 per cent. of the capital of the Federal Land Banks, for which stock is outstanding to Farm Loan Associations, is required to be invested in United States bonds. Both kinds of banks are empowered to buy and sell United States bonds.\n In First National Bank v. Trust Co., \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169 supra, this court sustained the power of Congress to enable a national bank to transact business, which, by itself considered, might be beyond the power of Congress to authorize. In that case it was held to be within the authority of Congress to permit national banks to exercise, by permission of the Federal Reserve Board, when not in contravention of local law, the office of trustee, executor, administrator or registrar of stocks or bonds.\n We therefore conclude that the creation of these banks, and the grant of authority to them to act for the government as depositaries of public moneys and purchasers of government bonds, brings them within the creative power of Congress although they may be intended, in connection with other privileges and duties, to facilitate the making of loans upon farm security at low rates of interest. This does not destroy the validity on these enactments any more than the general banking powers destroyed the authority of Congress to create the United States Bank, or the authority given to national banks to carry on additional activities destroyed the authority of Congress to create those institutions.\n In the brief filed upon reargument counsel for the appellant seem to admit the power of Congress to appropriate money for the direct purposes named and in that brief they say: 'Tax exemption is the real issue sought to be settled here.' Deciding, as we do, that these institutions \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 212]\n\u00a0\n have been created by Congress within the exercise of its legitimate authority, we think the power to make the securities here involved tax exempt necessarily follows. This principle was settled in McCulloch v. Maryland, and Osborn v. Bank, supra.\n That the federal government can, if it sees fit to do so, exempt such securities from taxation, seems obvious upon the clearest principles. But it is said to be an invasion of state authority to extend the tax exemption so as to restrain the power of the state. Of a similar contention made in McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice Marshall uttered his often quoted statement:\n'That the power to tax involves the power to destroy; that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to create; that there is a plain repugnance, in conferring on one government a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied.' 4 Wheat. 431.\n\n The same principle has been recognized in the National Bank Cases, declaring the power of the states to tax the property and franchises of national banks only to the extent authorized by the laws of Congress. Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 537, involved the validity of a franchise tax in Kentucky on national banks. In that case this court declared (\n173 \nU.S. 668, 669\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 538, 539 [43 L. Ed. 850]) that the states were wholly without power to levy any tax directly or indirectly upon national banks, their property, assets or franchises, except so far as the permissive legislation of Congress allowed such taxation; and the court declared that the right granted to tax the real estate of such banks, and the shares in the names of the shareholders, constituted the extent of the permission given by Congress, and any tax beyond these was declared to be void. \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 213]\n\u00a0\n In Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 U.S. 516\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 354, this court held that a state may not tax bonds issued by the municipality of a territory; that to tax such bonds as property in the hands of the holder is, in the last analysis, an imposition upon the right of a municipality to issue them.\n The exercise of such taxing power by the states might be so used as to hamper and destroy the exercise of authority conferred by Congress, and this justifies the exemption. If the states can tax these bonds, they may destroy the means provided for obtaining the necessary funds for the future operation of the banks. With the wisdom and policy of this legislation we have nothing to do. Ours is only the function of ascertaining whether Congress in the creation of the banks, and in exempting these securities from taxation, federal and state, has acted within the limits of its constitutional authority. For the reasons stated, we think the contention of the government, and of the appellees, that these banks are constitutionally organized and the securities here involved legally exempted from taxation, must be sustained.\n It follows that the decree of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n No doubt it is desirable that the question raised in this case should be set at rest, but that can be done by the Courts of the United States only within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. As this suit was brought by a citizen of Missouri against a Missouri corporation the \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 214]\n\u00a0\n single ground upon which the jurisdiction of the District Court can be maintained is that the suit 'arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States' within the meaning of section 24 of the Judicial Code. I am of opinion that this case does not arise in that way and therefore that the bill should have been dismissed.\n It is evident that the cause of action arises not under any law of the United States but wholly under Missouri law. The defendant is a Missouri corporation and the right claimed is that of a stockholder to prevent the directors from doing an act, that is, making an investment, alleged to be contrary to their duty. But the scope of their duty depends upon the charter of their corporation and other laws of Missouri. If those laws had authorized the investment in terms the plaintiff would have had no case, and this seems to me to make manifest what I am unable to deem even debatable, that, as I have said, the cause of action arises wholly under Missouri law. If the Missouri law authorizes or forbids the investment according to the determination of this Court upon a point under the Constitution or Acts of Congress, still that point is material only because the Missouri law saw fit to make it so. The whole foundation of the duty is Missouri law, which at its sole will incorporated the other law as it might incorporate a document. The other law or document depends for its relevance and effect not on its own force but upon the law that took it up, so I repeat once more the cause of action arises wholly from the law of the State.\n But it seems to me that a suit cannot be said to arise under any other law than that which creates the cause of action. It may be enough that the law relied upon creates a part of the cause of action although not the whole, as held in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 819-823, which perhaps is all that is meant by the less guarded expressions in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 379. I am content to assume this to be so, although the Osborn Case \n\n[255 U.S. 180, 215]\n\u00a0\n has been criticized and regretted. But the law must create at least a part of the cause of action by its own force, for it is the suit, not a question in the suit, that must arise under the law of the United States. The mere adoption by a State law of a United States law as a criterion or test, when the law of the United States has no force proprio vigore, does not cause a case under the State law to be also a case under the law of the United States, and so it has been decided by this Court again and again. Miller v. Swann, \n150 \nU.S. 132, 136\n, 137 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 52; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n237 \nU.S. 300, 303\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 598. See, also, Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, \n177 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 509 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 726.\n I find nothing contrary to my views in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414. It seems to me plain that the objection that I am considering was not before the mind of the Court or the subject of any of its observations, if open. I am confirmed in my view of that case by the fact that in the next volume of reports is a decision, reached not without discussion and with but a single dissent, that 'a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.' That was the ratio decidendi of American Wells Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., \n241 \nU.S. 257, 260\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 585. I know of no decisions to the contrary and see no reason for overruling it now.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this dissent. In view of our opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction we express no judgment on the merits. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN IOWA ELECTRIC CO. v. CITY OF CHARITON, IOWA(1921)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 539, 540]\n\u00a0\n In No. 180:\n Messrs. Emmet Tinley, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, and William D. McHugh, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. J. W. Kridebaugh, of Chariton, Iowa, and H. W. Byers, of Harlan, Iowa, for appellees.\n In No. 189:\n Messrs. John A. Reed and William Chamberlain, both of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for appellant.\n Mr. Ralph H. Munro, of Fairfield, Iowa, for appellees.\n In No. 190:\n Messrs. William Chamberlain, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Joe R. Lane, of Davenport, Iowa, for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n At the time these suits were begun the appellants were engaged in supplying electricity or gas to the municipal corporations who are the appellees. This service was being rendered by virtue of ordinances conferring franchises to use the city streets during 25 years in two of the cases and 20 years in the other. The ordinances contained a schedule of maximum rates. After they were in effect a few years the three suits which are before us were begun against the cities with the object of preventing the enforcement \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 541]\n\u00a0\n of the maximum rates specified in the ordinances, on the ground that such rates were so unreasonably low that their continued enforcement would deprive the corporations of remuneration for the services by them being performed and in fact, if enforced, would result in the confiscation of their property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In the three cases the court granted a temporary injunction restraining the enforcement of the maximum rates and allowed an order permitting, pending the suits, a higher charge.\n The cases were submitted upon the pleadings and without the taking of testimony upon issues which presented the contention, that the ordinances were contracts and therefore the maximum rates which they fixed were susceptible of continued enforcement against the corporations, although their operation would be confiscatory. In one opinion, applicable to the three cases, the court stated its reasons for maintaining this view, but directed attention to the fact that no proof had been offered concerning the confiscatory character of the rates, and pointing out that as such subject might become important on appeal, it would be necessary to restore the cases to the docket for proof in that regard unless the situation was remedied by agreement between the parties. Thereupon the pleadings were amended so as to directly present, separately from the other issues in the case, the right of the cities to enforce the ordinance rates in consequence of the contracts, without reference to whether such rates were in and of themselves confiscatory. Upon its opinion as to the existence of contracts and the power to make them as previously stated, the court entered decrees enforcing the ordinance rates which are now before us for review because of the constitutional question involved.\n Two propositions are indisputable: (a) That although the governmental agencies having authority to deal with \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 542]\n\u00a0\n the subject may fix and enforce reasonable rates to be paid public utility corporations for the services by them rendered, that power does not include the right to fix rates which are so low as to be confiscatory of the property of such corporations, Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 U.S. 362\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1047; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 418; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 442\n, 23 S. Sup.

Cas. 1034; Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Ceder Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 U.S. 655\n, 32 Sup.

Ct. 278; and (b) that where, however, the public service corporations and the governmental agencies dealing with them have power to contract as to rates, and exert that power by fixing by contract rates to govern during a particular time, the enforcement of such rates is controlled by the obligation resulting from the contract and therefore the question of whether such rates are confiscatory becomes immaterial, Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport, \n180 \nU.S. 587, 593\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Detroit v. Detroit City Ry. Co., \n184 U.S. 368\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 410; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 437\n, 23 S. Sup.

R. 1648\n\n\n It follows that as the rates here involved are conceded to be confiscatory they cannot be enforced unless they are secured by a contract obligation. The existence of a binding contract as to the rates upon which the lower court based its conclusion is, therefore, the single issue upon which the controversy depends. Its solution turns, first, upon the question of the power of the parties to contract on the subject, and second, if they had such power, whether they exercised it. \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 543]\n\u00a0\n As to the first, assuming for the sake of the argument only, that the public service corporations had the contractual power, the issue is: Had to municipal corporations under the law of Iowa such authority? Its possession must have been conferred, if at all, by section 725 of the Iowa Code of 1897 which deals with that subject. That statute came before the Supreme Court of Iowa for consideration in the very recent case of Town of Woodward v. Iowa Railway & Light Co., 178 N. W. 549. That was a suit by the town of Woodward to compel the light company to continue to furnish electric lighting at the rates fixed by the ordinance conferring upon the company its franchise to maintain and operate its plant in the town. The company resisted on the ground that the rates had become confiscatory and were not enforceable. Testimony offered by the company to establish the confiscatory character of the rates was objected to by the town, which asserted that the acceptance by the company of the ordinance bound it by contract to furnish the service at the rates therein prescribed whether or not they were confiscatory, and that the evidence offered was therefore immaterial. The evidence was received, subject to the objection, and the court, finding the rates to be confiscatory, sustained the company's contention and dismissed the bill. Upon appeal by the town, the Supreme Court, affirming the action of the trial court, said:\n'The defendant's franchise in the town of Woodward was granted in June, 1912, by ordinance duly enacted by the city council and duly approved by vote of the electors, as required by section 720 of the Code. Section 6 of the ordinance which granted the franchise specified the rates to be charged by the defendant to consumers. The term of the franchise was 25 years. The essence of the plaintiff's contention is that the enactment of this ordinance (including the franchise and the rates and the approval \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 544]\n\u00a0\n of the same by the electors), and the practical acceptance of the same by the utility corporation, constituted a contract binding as such both upon the town and upon the utility corporation. The defendant resists this contention and likewise denies that there is any power conferred by statute upon the city council to enter into contract on the subject of rates. The issue at this point is the controlling one in the case. The question thus at issue is answered by section 725 of the Code of 1897, which provides as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 725. Regulation of Rates and Service.-They shall have power to require every individual or private corporation operating such works or plant, subject to reasonable rules and regulations, to furnish any person applying therefor, along the line of its pipes, mains, wires, or other conduits, with gas, water, light or power and to supply said city or town with water for fire protection and with gas, water, light or power for other necessary public purposes [and to regulate and fix the rent or rates for water, gas, heat and electric light or power], ... and these powers shall not be abridged by ordinance, resolution or contract.'1\n\n'It will be noted from the foregoing that the legislative power to fix rates is conferred by this section upon the city council. The legislative power thus conferred is a continuing one, and may not be abridged or bartered away by contract or otherwise. ... There was a time in the history of our legislation when the right of contract as to rates was conferred by statute upon the city council. ... By the revision and codification of 1897, the right of contract as to rates for utilities of this character was entirely eliminated, and the legislative \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 545]\n\u00a0\n power to regulate rates was conferred upon the city council in all cases. The reason for the change of method is obvious enough. Under the contract method, the rights of the public were often bartered away, either ignorantly or corruptly, and utility corporations became empowered through the contractual obligations to enforce extortionate rates. The net result of the progressive legislation is found in our present section 725, whereby it is forbidden to any existing city council to bind the city to any rate for any future time. The power of regulating the rate is always in the present city council. It must be said, therefore, that the rates fixed by section 6 of the ordinance hereinbefore referred to, were not fixed by contract.'\n\n Indeed, the doctrine thus expounded was out a reiteration of the rule of the Iowa law laid down in previous cases. City of Tipton v. Tipton Light & Heating Co., 176 Iowa, 224, 157 N. W. 844; Iowa Railway & Light Co. v. Jones Auto Co., 182 Iowa, 982, 164 N. W. 780; Town of Williams v. Iowa Falls Electric Co., 185 Iowa, 493, 170 N. W. 815. And again, more recently, in Ottumwa Railway & Light Co. v. City of Ottumwa, 178 N. W. 905, the court referring to the Town of Woodward Case and to the doctrine therein announced based upon the significance of section 725 of the Code of 1897, thus restated its former conclusion on that subject:\n'That statute in positive terms forbids any abridgment of the right to regulate and fix charges of service corporations named in the statute, either by ordinance, resolution, or contract. No one would now contend, in the teeth of the statute prohibition, that there can be a valid contract fixing permanent rates. As to corporations named in that statute we have held repeatedly that there can be no contracting that rates fixed for service shall not be changed. See Tipton v. Light Co., 176 Iowa, 224, 157 N. W. 844; Selkirk v. Gas Co., 176 N. W. 301. And see San Antonio Co. v. City (D. C.) 257 Fed. 467. To like \n\n[255 U.S. 539, 546]\n\u00a0\n effect is Iowa Co. v. Jones, 182 Iowa, 982, 164 N. W. 780. And in the last case it is held that the fixing of maximum rates in a franchise ordinance is therefore not a contract that such rates may not be changed before the time stated in such ordinance has lapsed, and that approval by the electors of rates in the franchise is merely an approval of the rates fixed by the franchise, as rates temporarily settled, with the understanding that the same might be changed either upward or downward.'\n\n The total want of power of the municipalities here in question to contract for rates, which is thus established, and the state public policy upon which the prohibition against the existence of such authority rests, absolutely exclude the existence of the right to enforce, as the result of the obligation of a contract, the concededly confiscatory rates which are involved, and therefore conclusively demonstrate the error committed below in enforcing such rates upon the theory of the existence of contract. And, indeed, the necessity for this conclusion becomes doubly manifest when it is borne in mind that the right here asserted to contract in derogation of the state law and of the rule of public policy announced by the court of last resort of the state is urged by municipal corporations whose every power depends upon the state law.

BERKSHIRE(1921)\nNo. 106\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. William I. Gilbert, of Los Angeles, Cal., and W. F. Herrin, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. C. B. Hudspeth and George E. Wallace, both of El Paso, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in a state court against the petitioner for causing the death of Linder, the plaintiff's \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n intestate. At the trial the petitioner requested instructions that Linder assumed the risk of injury from the cause complained of and that a verdict should be rendered for the defendant. These were refused, the defendant saving its rights upon the record, and the plaintiff got a verdict and judgment. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment; the Supreme Court denied a writ of error, and thereupon a writ of certiorari was allowed by this court upon the ground that an immunity set up under the Federal Employers's Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657 8665) was involved.\n The facts so far as made definite by the evidence are not in dispute. Linder was employed by the defendant as an engineer upon a train running from El Paso, Texas, to Deming, New Mexico. At Carney, in New Mexico, he was found sitting on his engineer's seat, unconscious, with his right arm and pretty nearly half of his body outside of the cab, leaning with the right side and arm over the arm rest of the engine. There was a cut about an inch over the right ear. He had been struck by the end of a mail crane, or a mail sack that had been placed on it to be picked up by a mail train following Linder's which was an extra carrying soldiers. In order to have uniformity the Post Office Department fixes the distance of the cranes from the equipment, and the length of the hooks so that, in the language of a witness for the plaintiff:\n'The same hook that will take a sack off a crane in Arizona or New Mexico will take it as it goes through western Kansas.'\n\n The evidence was all to the effect that this crane stood at the same distance as all the others along the road. The end of the crane when elevated was not nearer to the train than fourteen inches, but might have been found to be as near as that, and therefore near enough to be capable of hitting a person leaning out of the window, as indeed was shown by the event.\n Linder had been upon this route for some years, had \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n passed over it many times and must be presumed to have known of the crane. It was visible from the engineer's seat, half a mile ahead through a front window. About a mile before reaching Carney Linder had noticed that the main driving pin on the engine was getting hot, had crept out upon the running board to see about it, and had returned. It may be supposed that at the time of the accident he was leaning out of the side window to look at it again and was acting in the course of his duty. The position in which has body was first seen and the place of the wound indicate that the was more than fourteen inches out from the engine's side.\n In this case the question is not whether a reasonable insurance against such misfortunes should not be thrown upon the travelling public through the railroads, or whether it always is possible for a railroad employee to exercise what would be called due care for his own safety and to do what he is hired to do. The question is whether the railroad is liable under the statute according to the principles of the common law regarding tort. The first element in it is the standard of conduct to be laid down for the road. The standard concerns a permanent condition not only at this place, but at many places along the road and presumably at innumerable others on all the large railroads of the United States. There are no special circumstances to qualify this part of the question-which is whether or not it is consistent with the duty of a railroad to its employees to erect railroad cranes of which the end of the arm when in use is fourteen inches from the side of the train. The railroad is required and presumed to know its duty in the matter and it would seem that the Court ought to be equally well informed. It cannot be that the theory of the law requires it to be left to the uncertain judgment of a jury in every case. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Pool, \n160 \nU.S. 438, 440\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 338.\n It is impracticable to require railroads to have no \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n structures so near to their tracks as to endanger people who lean from the windows of the cars. Most passengers are familiar with cautions against putting out heads or arms. However it may be in other cases where there is more or less choice as to position, this is true as to the postal cranes. The farthest point at which a bag could be picked up is twenty nine inches, and it requires a less distance than that to be sure of getting the bag. In short it would be impossible to use the contrivance with absolute certainty that no accident would happen if a man put his head out at the wrong moment. It equally is impossible to condemn railroads as wrongdoers simply for adopting the device with the conditions imposed by the Post Office Department. When a railroad is built it is practically certain that some deaths will ensue, but the builders are not murderers on that account when the foreseen comes to pass. On the common law principles of tort the adoption of an improvement in the public interest does not throw the risk of all incidental damage upon those who adopted it, however fair it may be to put the expenses of insurance upon those who use it. It is going very far to leave it open to a jury to attach liability in tort to a system by which the end of the arms of postal cranes come to fourteen inches from the car.\n But further, we must take it, as we have said, that Linder perfectly well knew of the existence of the crane where it stood, and could have seen it from his seat had he looked, long before he reached it. He entered the employment of the railroad when it had this appliance manifest in its place. The only element of danger that he may not have appreciated was the precise distance which the point of the crane would reach. But an experienced railroad man cannot be supposed to have been ignorant that such a projection threatened danger and, knowing so much, he assumed the risk that obviously would attend taking the chances of leaning well out from \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n the train. As we have said, the only possible inference on the uncontradicted evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses was that he leaned out considerably more than fourteen inches as shown by the position of his body and the place of the cut on his head. The probability is that the distance of the crane was somewhat greater than the minimum that we have assumed, but that we lay on one side. Confining ourselves to the case of postal cranes we are of opinion that to allow the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff was to allow them to substitute sympathy for evidence and to impose a standard of conduct that had no warrant in the common law. Butler v. Frazee, \n211 U.S. 459\n, 465 467, 29 Sup. Ct. 136. Kenney v. Meddaugh, 118 Fed. 209, 55 C. C. A. 115.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n Engineer Linder, when leaning out of his cab, in the discharge of his duty to see the condition of a 'hot driving pin,' was struck on the head and killed by the end of a horizontally extended arm of a mail crane. There is no question of contributory negligence in the case-the judgment could not be reversed for that, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The negligence of the railroad company is palpable but, nevertheless, the finding of a properly instructed jury and of two state courts, is here reversed because this Court concludes, as a matter of fact, that the mail crane arm was such an obvious and conspicuous source of danger to Linder that he must be held, as a matter of law, to have assumed the danger from it, by continuing in the service of the company.\n The record shows: That Linder was a freight engineer, and as such had nothing to do with mail cranes and had neither occasion nor opportunity, except very rarely, to see what, if any, danger the crane arms could be to him when in the discharge of his duties, for, during the two \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n years next before his death, he had made but twelve trips on passenger trains, only three of which were on trains which 'picked up' mail from cranes; that when mail cranes are not in use the arms hang vertically beside the supporting post, which is three feet eight inches from the side of an engine, and obviously in such position they are not a source of danger to train men; that, on the line involved, the arms of cranes were extended horizontally toward the track, so as to be a source of danger to engineers, only two or three times a day, at widely separated intervals, when they were used to support a mail bag for ten minutes before the arrival of each mail train,-a fraction of an hour in twenty four; and that Linder, when leaning out of his cab to see the condition of a hot driving pin, was struck an inch above his ear, so that if the arm had been three or four inches farther from the track he would not have been injured.\n The record does not show: That Government requirments for mail cranes require them to be as close to the track as this one was. On the contrary, the only evidence to the point is that of an employe in the Government mail service, who testified, that the hooks on mail cars are adjusted to catch mail bags if within twenty nine inches of their sides, that allowing for the swaying of the cars, they will catch them if twenty six inches away, and that the sides of the cars are 'flush' with the sides of engine cabs. The point of the crane arm which killed Linder 'was about fourteen inches from the side of the cab,' but on this evidence it could have been placed twenty six inches away, where it would not have been a source of danger to him.\n Although the civil engineer, who had charge of the cranes on the division, was a witness for the company, he was not asked the distance of the crane causing the injury, or of any other crane, from the track-a suspicious circumstance-and that other cranes were at the same distance \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n as the one which caused the injury can only be inferred from inadequate statements of witnesses who had never made any measurements and who gave the merest impressions with respect to them. Where, as here, three or four inches is a matter of life and death, random estimates are valueless and should not be accepted, especially when the company certainly had perfectly definite information, which was suppressed. A hard and fast assumption of law should not be based on findings of fact by this court derived from such evidence.\n There is no description whatever in the record of the length, dimensions or appearance of the arms of the crane which caused the death of Linder. How, on such evidence, can it be justly stated, that such crane arm was so permanent and conspicuous a source of danger that, as a matter of law, Linder, a freight engineer, usually running past it at high speed when its arms were down, should be charged with knowing and appreciating and assuming the risk!\n It has been a criminal offense in Ohio for twenty years to maintain mail cranes nearer than eighteen inches to the nearest point of contact with the widest locomotive on the road erecting such cranes, 97 O. L. 274, and there are similar statutes in other States. If the point of the crane arm here involved had been eighteen inches, four inches farther than it was, from the engine, Linder would not have been injured.\n There is no evidence whatever that Linder actually knew that the crane arm extended close enough to the track to cause him injury, and the latest formulation by this Court of the rule applicable to the case is:\n'In order to charge an employe with the assumption of a risk attributable to a defect due to the employer's negligence [as this defect was] it must appear not only that he knew (or is presumed to have known) of the defect, but that he knew that it endangered his safety; or else \n\n[254 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n such danger must have been so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances would have appreciated it.' Gila Valley, etc., Ry. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 102\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 229, 231 (58 L. Ed. 521).\n\n Earlier expressions of the rule are that the danger must be 'plainly observable' (Texas & P. R. Co. v. Archibald, \n170 \nU.S. 665, 672\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 777, 780 [42 L. Ed. 1188]; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 24), or 'so patent as to be readily observable' (Texas & P. R. Co. v. Swearingen, \n196 \nU.S. 51, 62\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 164, 168 [49 L. Ed. 382]).\n It is 'a strong thing' to hold, on the indefinite evidence in this record, which I have attempted accurately to detail, that a mail crane arm is such a permanent and conspicuous source of danger to a freight engineer as to bring this case within the scope of the decisions cited, and it is a yet stronger thing to reverse the finding of a jury properly instructed, and the judgments, on a question of fact, of two state courts, which the record shows acted with full appreciation of, and with a desire to follow, the decisions of this Court with respect to assumption of risk.\n In practice certainly, and I think in theory, the decision of the Court in this case will introduce a new and unfortunate standard into the law of assumption of risk, which will confuse the doctrine as it has been worked out in the cases cited, will render railway companies careless in placing obstructions near to thier tracks, and will result in the injury and death of many innocent and careful men, if the effect of it is not promptly corrected by State and National statutes, and therefore I cannot consent to join in it.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice PITNEY join in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPRINGFIELD GAS & ELECTRIC CO. v. CITY OF SPRINGFIELD(1921)\nNo. 46\nArgued: October 19, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Philip Barton Warren, of Springfield, Ill., Joseph S. Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., and William L. Patton, of Springfield, Ill., for plaintiff in error.[ Springfield Gas & Electric Co v. City of Springfield \n257 U.S. 66\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[257 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bayard Lacey Catron and A. D. Stevens, both of Springfield, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the plaintiff in error, a private gas and electric company, to restrain the defendant City from producing and selling electricity to private consumers without first filing schedules of rates and printing and posting the same as required by sections 33, 34 of the Public Utilities Act of June 30, 1913 (Laws 1913, pp. 476, 477). The bill was dismissed on demurrer by the Court of first instance. An appeal was taken to the \n\n[257 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court where the decree was affirmed on rehearing, after a previous decision the other way. The public Utilities Act and the Municipal Ownership Act were enacted by the State of Illinois within a few days of each other and, according to the Supreme Court of the State, as parts of a single plan. The former excepts municipal corporations from its requirements and the latter allows cities to go into this business among others and to fix the rates, which in the plaintiff's case are subject to the approval of the State Public Utilities Commission. The plaintiff contends that the exception of municipal corporations from the Public Utilities Act is void under the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Act should be enforced as if the exception were not there.\n It might perhaps be a sufficient answer to the plaintiff's case that the Supreme Court has intimated after careful consideration that the Utilities Act must stand or fall as a whole, so that if the plaintiff's attack upon the exception were sustained the whole statute would be inoperative and the only ground of the suit would fail. The plaintiff attempts to reargue the question, but upon this point the decision of the State Court would be final and would control. However, as the Supreme Court did not stop at that point, but, assuming that under the law of Illinois the plaintiff had a standing to demand the relief sought if its case was otherwise good went on to decide the validity of the exception, we think it proper to follow the same course and to deal with the constitutional question raised.\n The plaintiff's argument shortly stated is that in selling electricity the city stands like any other party engaged in a commercial enterprise and that to leave it free in the matter of charges while the plaintiff is subject to the Public Utilities Board is to deny to the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws. But we agree with the Supreme Court of the State that the difference between the two types of corporation warrants the different treatment that they have received. \n\n[257 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n The private corporation whatever its public duties is organized for private ends and may be presumed to intend to make whatever profit the business will allow. The municipal corporation is allowed to go into the business only on the theory that thereby the public welfare will be subserved. So far as gain is an object it is a gain to a public body and must be used for public ends. Those who manage the work cannot lawfully make private profit their aim, as the plaintiff's directors not only may but must. The Supreme Court seems to interpret the Municipal Ownership Act ( Laws 1913, p. 455) as limiting the charges allowed to what will be sufficient to meet outlays and expenses of every kind, thus emphasizing the purely public nature of the interests concerned and excluding the latitude for wrong that the plaintiff fears. The Court further says that the municipalities can exercise their power to make all needful rules and regulations only by ordinances and resolutions as in other public action. It calls attention to the fact that the accounts are regulated by law and open to the public eye, and that the consumers in this as in the other case may have a resort to the courts.\n The plaintiff did not venture to contend that the submission of similar duties of diferent bodies to different tribunals was of itself unconstitutional, or that the fixing of rates might not be entrusted to city councils. But the fact that the municipality owned the plant for which its council fixed the rate was supposed to disqualify its officers, at least when other plants were submitted to the judgment of strangers. But a city council has no such interest in the city's electric plant as to make it incompetent to fix the rates. Whatever the value of the distinction between the private and public functions of the municipality, the duty of its governing board in this respect as we have said is public and narrowly fixed by the act. The conduct of which the plaintiff complains is not extortion but on the contrary charging rates that \n\n[257 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n draw the plaintiff's customers away. The standard for these rates, however, according to the Supreme Court, is fixed by the Legislature. If the rates had been fixed by law at the present amounts it would be vain to deny their validity. The trouble with the plaintiff's argument is that it attempts to go behind the interpretation that the Supreme Court has given to the acts concerned and to overwork the delicate distinction between the private and public capacities of municipal corporations. It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous cases upon classification by state laws in order to show that the distinction in question here is very far from being so arbitrary that we can pronounce it bad.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS & S. F. R. CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF STATE OF(1921)\nNo. 117\nArgued: Decided: January 17, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. F. Evans and Edward T. Miller, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. James D. Lindsay, of Jefferson City, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error's main line extends from St. Louis to Memphis-305 miles. As originally constructed it turned sharply southeastward at Hayti, Mo.-220 miles from St. Louis-ran thence 7 miles to Caruthersville, a city of 4,000 people, thence southwestward 9 miles to Grassy Bayou, and thence south. A 'cut-off' between Hayti and Grassy Bayou-6 miles-became part of the main line in 1904, and thereafter through freight and night passenger trains passed that way. The through day passenger trains-Nos. 801 and 802- continued to \n\n[254 U.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n move along the old line until August, 1913, when they were routed over the 'cut-off.' At the same time two new daily passenger trains were put on and operated between Blytheville, Ark., and Cape Girardeau, Mo., by way of Caruthersville.\n The Missouri Public Service Commission directed the railway company to restore trains 801 and 802 to the route followed prior to 1913 and the state Supreme Court approved this action. We are asked to declare the order invalid because it unduly burdens interstate commerce. The point is well taken.\n Fourteen local daily passenger trains move in and out of Caruthersville-seven each way. Some of these make close connections with all through trains at Hayti. These locals do not carry equipment of the highest class, but apparently they afford fair facilities for reaching and leaving Caruthersville without serious delay or great inconvenience. If deficient in schedule or equipment, there is an easy remedy by means other than detours of the through trains.\n The applicable general doctrine has been often considered and in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. Wisconsin R. R. Commission, \n237 \nU.S. 220, 226\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 560, 562 (59 L. Ed. 926), this court said:\n'In reviewing the decision we may start with certain principles as established: (1) It is competent for a state to require adequate local facilities, even to the stoppage of interstate trains or the re- arrangement of their schedules. (2) Such facilities existing-that is, the local conditions being adequately met-the obligation of the railroad is performed, and the stoppage of interstate trains becomes an improper and illegal interference with interstate commerce. (3) And this, whether the interference be directly by the Legislature or by its command through the orders of an administrative body. (4) The fact of local facilities this court may determine, such fact being necessarily in volved \n\n[254 U.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n in the determination of the federal question whether an order concerning an interstate train does or does not directly regulate interstate commerce, by imposing an arbitrary requirement. Gladson v. Minnesota, \n166 U.S. 427\n; Lake Shore R. R. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 285\n; Atlantic Coast Line v. Nor. Car. Corp. Comm., \n206 U.S. 1\n; Mo. Pac. Ry. v.

Wharton, \n207 U.S. 328\n.'\n\n Considering the facts disclosed we think it plain that the fourteen local passenger trains meet the reasonable requirements of Caruthersville and that the commission's order unduly burdens interstate commerce. Compliance with it would require the railway to maintain 16 more miles of track at the high standard essential for the through trains, and to move the latter 10 miles further with consequent delay and inconveniences all along the line. The burden certainly would not be less serious than thoses which were condemned in some if not all of the causes above referred to.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS &C. RY. CO. v. HAGERMAN(1921)\nNo. 261\nArgued: March 23, 1921Decided: May 2, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph S. Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., and William E. Garvin, of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Thomas G. Rutledge, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, hereinafter referred to as the Bridge Electric Company, a corporation organized under missouri law, was the owner in 1906 of 865-1000ths of a mile of electric railway, constructed upon and extending from the easterly to the westerly end of the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi river at St. Louis. In that year the State Board of Equalization of Missouri valued the portion of this railroad which was within that state at $186,019, and levied a tax upon it for state and local purposes, which the plaintiff in error refused to pay, and thereupon this suit was instituted to recover the amount of the tax.\n The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts and the state prevailed in all the state courts. Only one of the several defenses relied upon in the answer has been argued in this court, viz. that the tax is invalid because, if allowed, it would constitute a direct and unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n The state statute provided that in valuing railroads for taxation the State Board of Equalization should determine the total value of the entire property in the state, tangible \n\n[256 U.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n and intangible, of each company, and that from this total it should deduct the value of all its tangible property and then 'enter the remainder upon the assessment list ... under the head of 'all other property.\" Laws of Missouri 1901, p. 232,  2.\n Complying with this statute the Board of Equalization valued all of the rolling stock, poles, wires and cash of the Bridge Electric Company at $ 32,630 per mile, the roadbed and superstructure at $5,000 per mile, and 'all other property' at $500,000 per mile, making a total value per mile of $537,630.\n There were .346 of a mile of the track in the state of Missouri and this proportion of the total value per mile, amounting to $186,019 (of which $173,000 was included under the item 'all other property'), was the amount on which the disputed tax was levied.\n The unit rule thus adopted by the Board of Equalization has long been a familiar method, often approved by this court, for valuing interstate railroad properties. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1122; St. Louis Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Arkansas, ex rel. Norwood, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 99; Branson v. Bush, \n251 U.S. 182\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 113.\n It is not contended that this valuation is unreasonable in amount, but only that the property of the company, which was valued as 'all other property,' consisted solely of its franchise to conduct interstate passenger traffic over the interstate bridge and that therefore the tax, so far as levied on the valuation placed on that property, is a direct tax and burden on the right to engage in interstate commerce and that it is, for this reason, unconstitutional.\n But the stipulation on which the case was tried does not sustain this contention.\n This stipulation shows that in 1902 the Bridge Electric Company acquired by contract with the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis the exclusive right to operate an electric railroad over the Eads Bridge for the term of \n\n[256 U.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n 50 years (for passenger traffic only and for a part of the fare to be charged), and that in the same agreement it entered into a written contract with two other electric railroad companies for the recited purpose of causing all passenger traffic originating on the lines then or thereafter controlled by them to pass over the Bridge Electric Company's road. Of the two latter companies thus contracted with, one operated extensive lines of electric street railroad in the city of East St. Louis, in Illinois, and the other operated an extensive system of suburban electric railways in Illinois. Both of these Illinois systems connected with the Bridge Company's track at the easterly end of the bridge.\n Later in the same year, 1902, the Bridge Electric Company entered into another agreement by which the company operating lines in East St. Louis contracted for a percentage of the fares to be collected for transportation over the bridge, to furnish the cars, crews and equipment for carrying, and to operate the cars necessary to carry, all passengers across the bridge, without change of cars. Coupon tickets were to be issued to passengers traveling either way across the bridge, and other conveniences were provided for the purpose of increasing the bridge traffic.\n It is apparent that the large value which it is conceded this street railroad had was derived, not from its mere franchise to do an interstate business, but from the exclusive right which we have seen the company acquired by private contract to operate over the Eads Bridge, a public highway, and from the other rights also derived from private contract which made its line of track a part of two Illinois systems of railway and gave it a profitable operating arrangement with them. It was these contracts which gave the company's small extent of physical property an earning capacity, and therefore a value, which enabled it to pay from their date in 1902 to the date of the disputed assessment 5 per cent. annual \n\n[256 U.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n interest on $500,000 of bonded indebtedness and an annual dividend of about 3 per cent. on an equal amount of capital stock.\n The law applicable to the state of facts thus developed was summarized in Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 817, in a form which has been frequently approved by this court, notably in St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 365\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99. Slightly condensed, it is that, while a state may not, in the guise of taxation, constitutionally compel a corporation to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, yet this immunity does not prevent the state from imposing an ordinary property tax upon property having a situs within its territory and employed in interstate commerce. Even the franchise of a corporation, if not derived from the United States, although that franchise is the business of interstate commerce, is subject to state taxation as a part of its property.\n The record does not show what the specific items were which entered into the consideration of the Board of Equalization in valuing 'all other property' of the Bridge Electric Company, but it appears from the stipulation that the president of the company was heard with respect to the valuation and assessment of all of its property, and we cannot doubt that the contracts we have described, which very plainly gave to this short line of railway much of the value as a going concern which led the company to bond and capitalize it at $1,000,000, and the board to value it at approximately one-half that amount, must have been taken into consideration by the board, and that, therefore, the contention that the tax was levied exclusively upon the franchise to do an interstate business is not sound and must be rejected.\n It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS-SAN FRANCISCO RY. CO. V.MIDDLEKAMP(1921)\nNo. 636\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward T. Miller, of St. Louis, Mo., and Henry S. Conrad, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellant.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank W. McAllister, of Paris, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill to restrain the collection of a franchise tax imposed by the statutes of Missouri upon domestic corporations. Laws of 1917, pp. 237-242.1 The plaintiff, a corporation of Missouri, filed with the State Tax Com \n\n[256 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n mission a report, as required by law, showing the value of its assets within the State to be $122,826,652, and the amount of its stock employed within the State $21,625,830. The State Tax Commission accepted these figures and following the statute levied a tax measured by 3\/40 of one per cent. of the capital stock employed within the State, and also the same tax in respect of the excess in value of the assets within the State over that of such stock, treating that as the 'surplus' which the statute takes as the measure along with the stock. The result of course was a tax of 3\/40 of one per cent. upon $122,826,852, equal to $92,119.99. The plaintiff contests the constitutionality of the Act under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause (art. 1,  8), and under a supposed prohibition of double taxation in the Constitution of Missouri. It also contends that if the Act was valid it was misconstrued in the ascertainment of the surplus over the value of the capital stock in the State. A preliminary injunction was denied by three judges sitting in the District Court and the plaintiff appealed.\n The objection most insisted upon in this Court was that the statute made no provision for a hearing, and that although the plaintiff applied to the Tax Commission for a hearing and had one, the statute was bad because it did not provide one in terms. Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Wright, \n207 \nU.S. 127, 138\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 47, 12 Ann. Cas. 463. The mode of collecting the tax is by a suit where, of course, the present plaintiff would be heard, but it is said that the judgment of the Commission can be attacked only for want of jurisdiction and fraud. We cannot suppose however that any question of law apparent on the face of the record would not be open. The constitutional objection mainly relied upon necessarily would be. And as in this case the Commission accepted the plaintiff's figures and the contest is wholly upon matters of law, we see nothing of which \n\n[256 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff can complain in this respect. There is to be sure one charge involving matter of fact dehors the record. It is alleged that the plaintiff was taxed disproportionately as compared with other railroads. But the plaintiff was taxed upon its own figures in accordance with the statute and could not complain of that. If it had made out a case of fraud against the Commission we presume that the State Courts would have been open to it, as well as the District Court of the United States. But nothing of that kind was proved. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 495\n\n\n The next objection to the tax has assumed greater importance than any other because it induced the same judges who sat in this case to change their opinion and issue a temporary injunction in a suit like this brought by the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. We will consider it although it hardly is open on the bill. It now has been decided by the Supreme Court of Missouri that corporations with stock having no stated par value can be admitted to do business in the State, State ex rel. Standard Tank Co. v. Sullivan (Mo.) 221 S. W. 728, and that decision was taken to mean that all such corporations fall within a provision imposing a tax of only twenty-five dollars upon foreign corporations without a capital stock. On that ground it was held that the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company was denied the equal protection of the laws. We hesitate to differ from judges presumably familiar with local conditions, but we cannot read the careful discussion by the Missouri Court as having the meaning supposed. It is true that it adverts to the 'lump annual tax' imposed upon foreign corporations without a capital stock while arguing that the policy and laws of Missouri do not forbid their entering the State. But at a later page it quotes with approval a Kansas case to show not only that the absence of a stated value for the stock would create no difficulty \n\n[256 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n in determining whether a corporation should be admitted but also that it would create equally little difficulty in applying the tax imposed upon corporations with stock having a stated par. Until the Supreme Court of the State decides otherwise we shall assume that the supposed inequality of treatment does not exist.\n There is no contravention of the Commerce Clause. It is said that the value of the franchise taxed is derived partly from the fact that the corporation does interstate business, but that does not invalidate the tax. St. Louis & East St. Louis Electric Ry. Co. v. Missouri, \n256 U.S. 314\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 488, 65 L. Ed. --, decided to-day. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 365\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99. Of course the fact that the plaintiff's road was under federal control during the year in question does not exonerate it. It was profiting by its franchises although in a different way. Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25,  1, 15. 40 Stat. 451, 458 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a, 3115 3\/4 o).\n Nothing more needs to be said concerning the relation of the Act to the Constitution of the United States. As to the Constitution of Missouri we see no reason to believe that it has been violated and perceive no indication of such an opinion in the judgments of the Supreme Court of the State. That Court on the contrary seems to regard the Act as valid. State ex rel. Marquette Hotel Inv. Co. v. State Tax Commission, 221 S. W. Rep. 721. This case also sanctions the construction adopted by the Commission and the Court below for the word 'surplus' in the statute and shows that the amount of the tax was right. It is urged that where, as here, only a part of the corporation's capital is employed within the State the tax is measured by that part of the capital alone and no part of the surplus is taken into account. The words are, 'such corporation shall pay an annual franchise tax equal to three-fortieths of one per cent. of its capital stock employed in this State.' But these words follow the words laying the normal tax measured by stock and surplus, \n\n[256 U.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n and the sentence quoted continues 'and for the purposes of this act such corporation shall be deemed to have employed in this State that proportion of its entire outstanding capital stock and surplus that its property and assets in this State bear to all its property and assets wherever located.' We cannot much doubt that the tax was intended to be measured by the proportion of stock and surplus in the State, and that the omission of reference to surplus in the clause first quoted is a misprision or abbreviation that does not conceal the purpose to be gathered from the previous and following words. We think it unnecessary to go into further details.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1.

The Arkansas Railroad Commission having in June, 1908, adopted Standard Distance Tariff No. 3, establishing maximum intrastate freight rates, the present appellant railway company attacked its validity in a suit brought against the commission in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, contending that the rates were noncompensatory and therefore violative of the 'due process of law' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A temporary injunction was issued and continued in force until May 11, 1911, when the Circuit Court entered a final decree making the injunction permanent, and discharging the surety from further liability on the injunction bond. On appeal to this court the decree was reversed June 16, 1913, with directions to dismiss the bill without prejudice, and for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion and decree of this court. \n230 U.S. 553\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1030. Upon the going down of the mandate the United States District Court (successor of the Circuit Court) entered a decree in obedience thereto, at the same time making a reference to a special master for the purpose of ascertaining the claims of intervening shippers for refund of the difference paid by them in freight rates between those prescribed by the commission and the higher ones maintained by the railway company during the pendency of the injunction. Under this reference the present appellees J. F. Hasty & Sons presented a claim based upon the difference between rates charged on rough material transported from forest to milling points and the rates provided in the commission tariff on such movements. That tariff contained maximum rates on such lumber applicable generally, and in addition provided for a 'milling-in-transit privilege,' by fixing certain 'rough material rates' lower than the others, conditioned upon a specified percentage of the manufactured produce \n\n[255 U.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n being shipped out on the same line that brought in the rough material. The railway company excepted to the claim on two grounds: (a) That the rough material rates were descriminatory; and (b) that they were not applicable to the shipments of Hasty & Sons because these constituted interstate commerce and hence were not subject to the commissioner's rates. The District Court sustained both exceptions. The resulting decree so far as adverse to Hasty & Sons was reversed by this court (\n249 U.S. 134\n, 147-152, 39 Sup. Ct. 237), and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion. Upon the going down of this mandate there were further hearings before the referee and the District Court upon the claim of Hasty & Sons and claims of the same type presented by three other intervening shippers; and from the resulting decree in their favor the present appeal is taken. Although the only question immediately involved is the proper construction of the Standard Distance Tariff, we have jurisdiction, as we had in the Arkadelphia Case, supra, because the decree is but supplementary to the main cause-bringing to effective conclusion, if not vitiated by error, the controversy that arose out of the railway company's attack upon the rates on constitutional grounds-and hence must be regarded as involving the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States, within the meaning of section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). See \n249 U.S. 140\n-142, 39 Sup. Ct. 237.\n The disputed claims are based in the main upon alleged overcharges on rough material shipped over appellant's road to the respective mills of appellees, and there manufactured into heading for barrels. The question is whether item 79 of Distance Tariff No. 3 Provided a rough-material rate for heading. It reads as follows:\n'Item 79. Rough Material Rates.\n\n'(a) Rough material rates applicable on rough lumber, staves, flitches, bolts, and logs, carloads, \n\n[255 U.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n between all points in Arkansas, minimum weight. ...\n\n'[Here follows a table of rates graduated according to distance.]\n\n'(b) The above named rates are conditional upon the manufactured product being reshipped over the same line bringing in the rough material, and may be only used subject to the following conditions: The proportion of the tonnage of out-bound manufactured product to the tonnage of in-bound rough material shall not be less than the following: ...\n\n'[Here follows a table of percentages applicable to various products, among them:]\n\n'Finished staves, 40 per cent. of weight of rough staves. ...\n\n'Staves and heading, 30 per cent. of weight of bolts.'\n\n At the hearing before the master it was admitted that the claimants shipped out over the line of road that brought in the rough material the requisite percentages of manufactured product in the usual course of business; nevertheless, appellant objected to the allowance of the claims, on the ground that item 79 provided no rate on in-bound rough heading, but the same was covered by item 41, and since the general rates provided therein were higher than those actually charged, there was no basis for a refund. The objection was renewed in an exception to the master's report and urged at the hearing before the court on the report and exceptions. The master found that rough heading was covered as rough material in item 79, and the District Court sustained that conclusion.\n Appellant's contention is based upon a literal reading of the opening sentence of item 79: 'Rough material rates applicable on rough lumber, staves, flitches, bolts, and logs,' etc.; and since 'rough heading' is not mentioned here, while the associated material 'staves' is specified, it is contended that rough heading is not provided for. \n\n[255 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n From the testimony taken before the master it would appear that the raw material from which barrel heads are made is variously described as rough heading, sawed heading, split heading, and bolts or heading bolts; but it also appears that, whatever may be the distinctions, the terms are used loosely and indiscriminately in the trade and in billing shipments, material of either description being considered rough material, and all having been handled by the railway company under the rough material rate on its own schedules, without regard to particular terms.\n We regard appellant's reading of item 79 as altogether too narrow. The scope and effect of the rough material rates should be determined not by regarding the opening sentence alone, but by looking also to the list of finished products to be manufactured from the material, and considering the general purpose of item 79. In the table of percentages, there are specified 'finished staves, 40 per cent. of weight of rough staves,' and 'staves and heading, 30 per cent. of weight of bolts.' The purpose is manifest to give the benefit of the milling in transit rate to rough material out of which heading is manufactured, and no reason appears for limiting it to material of a particular description. The word 'bolts,' used in connection with staves and heading, should be taken not as confining the privilege to rough material of a particular form, but in the generic sense in which it is employed in wood working, as meaning:\n'A mass of wood from which anything may be cut or formed' (Century Dict.); 'A block of wood from which something is to be made; as a shingle bolt, a stave bolt' (Standard Dict.); 'A block of timber to be sawed or cut into shingles, staves, etc.' (Webster's Dict.).\n\n The matter is so free from doubt that there is no occasion to apply to the commission for a construction, as insisted by appellant under Texas & Pacific Ry. v.

The District Court found infringement and unfair competition, granted an injunction, and made a decree for an account of profits from March 11, 1914, when the infringement began, limiting the damages, however, to those suffered after August 26, 1916, that being the date when the plaintiff gave the defendant notice of the registration of the mark. The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the District Court as to the facts but limited the account as well as the damages to the date when notice was given of the registered mark, a few days before the bringing of this suit. 248 Fed. 154; Stark v. Stark Bros. Nurseries & Orchards Co., 257 Fed. 9, 168 C. C. A. 221. This limitation is the only question here.\n By section 28 of the Trade-Mark Act it is made the duty of the registrant to give notice to the public by attaching certain specified words or abbreviations to the trademark or to the receptacle wherein the article is enclosed; 'and in any suit for infringement by a party failing so to give notice of registration no damages shall be recovered, except on proof that the defendant was duly notified of infringement, and continued the same after such notice.' 33 Stat. 730 (Comp. St.  9514). The infringement that is sued for is infringement of a registered trademark, not infringement \n\n[255 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n of a trade-mark. That is the plain meaning of the above words and the necessary scope of this suit since that is the scope of the jurisdiction of the District Court. A. Lescher & Sons Rope Co. v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., \n201 \nU.S. 166, 172\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 425. It seems very plain that the plaintiff had a cause of action outside the statute, but that would have to be asserted elsewhere, as the suit was between citizens of the same State. The statute alone gave the right to come into this Court of the United States. Coming in to assert its statutory rights we will assume in the plaintiff's favor that it could recover for unfair competition that was inseparable from the statutory wrong, but it could not reach back and recover for earlier injuries to rights derived from a different source.\n The plaintiff argues that a notice of March 11, 1914, calling on the defendants 'to discontinue the unfair competition and infringement on our rights,' coupled with the willful character of the defendants' wrongdoing ought to lead to a different result, and the District Judge seems to have had a similar notion. But that is to forget the origin and necessary limit of the jurisdiction in this case.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA EX REL. WHIPPLE v.

Hilton, both of St. Paul, Minn., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relator was convicted of a violation of a statute of the state of Minnesota providing against the evils resulting from traffic in certain habit-forming narcotic drugs, and regulating the administration, sale, and possession thereof. Laws Minn. 1915, c. 260 (Gen. St. Minn. Supp. 1917,  8965-1 to 8965-5).\n The Minnesota statute in section 1 (section 8965-1) forbids the sale of morphine and certain other narcotic drugs, with the provision that licensed pharmacists may fill orders for the same to a consumer pursuant to the written prescription of a physician, which must be dated on the day on which it is signed, and bear the signature and address of the physician, and the name of the person for whose use it is intended. It must be serially numbered, dated and filed in the prescription file of the compounder, and retained there for two years, open for inspection by the authorities. Prescriptions may be filled but once, and no copy may be given, except to an officer of the law, and the drug must be delivered in a container labeled with the serial number of \n\n[256 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n the prescription, with the date when filled and the name of the person for whose use the medicine is intended, the name of the physician, and the name and address of the dispenser. The administration, sale, or disposal of the drugs by a legally licensed physician is permitted when made to a patient on whom he is in professional attendance. The physician must subscribe the name and address of the patient, the date of the sale or disposal, and the amount of the drug transferred, which must be delivered in a container labeled as required by the statute.\n Section 2 (section 8965-2) provides:\n'It shall be unlawful for any physician or dentist to furnish to or prescribe, for the use of any habitual user of the same, any of the substances enumerated in section 1 of this act: Provided that the provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent any legally licensed physician from prescribing in good faith, for the use of any patient under his care, for the treatment of a drug habit, such substances as he may deem necessary for such treatment; provided that such prescriptions are given in good faith for the treatment of such habit.'\n\n The trial court construed this section of the statute as making it unlawful for a physician to furnish the drugs to habitual users out of stock kept on hand by himself. And such was the offense of which the relator was convicted.\n This construction of the section, and the conviction and sentence were sustained by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. State v. Whipple, 143 Minn. 403, 173 N. W. 801. Thereupon the relator sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the district court of Hennepin county, Minn., which writ was discharged, and the order was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Minnesota. 144 Minn. 206, 174 N. W. 823. The case was then brought here to review this judgment of the state court upon writ of error.\n The grounds of attack upon the statute are based upon \n\n[256 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n an alleged deprivation of federal rights, it being contended: First, that the statute exceeds the authority of the state in the exertion of its police power, in that it undertakes to regulate a lawful business in the manner prescribed in the statute, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; second, that the statute conflicts with the terms and provisions of the federal Harrison Anti-Narcotic Drug Act, 38 Stat. 785 (Comp. St.  6287g- 6287q), and is therefore beyond the power of the state to enact.\n There can be no question of the authority of the state in the exercise of its police power to regulate the administration, sale, prescription and use of dangerous and habit-forming drugs, such as are named in the statute. The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the interest of the public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly established to be successfully called in question.\n As to the alleged inconsistency between the state statute and the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Drug Act, the state court held that there was no substantial conflict between the two enactments. The validity of the Harrison Act was sustained by this court in United States v. Doremus, \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 214, as a valid exercise of the authority of Congress under the power conferred by the Constitution to levy excise taxes. The provisions of the statute regulating the sale, dispensing or prescribing of drugs were held to bear a reasonable relation to the collection of the taxes provided for, and to be valid although the statute affected the conduct of a business which was subject to regulation by the police power of the state.\n It may be granted that the state has no power to enact laws which will render nugatory a law of Congress enacted to collect revenue under authority of constitutional enactments. See Savage v. Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715; McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 U.S. 115\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39. But we agree with the state \n\n[256 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n court that there is nothing in this statute which prevents enforcement of the revenue act in question. It is true that the provisions regulating the sale, dispensation, and disposition of the prohibited drugs are somewhat different in the two acts. The prohibitory measures of the federal statute do not apply to the disposition and dispensation of drugs by physicians registered under the act in the regular course of professional practice provided records are kept for official inspection. Under the state law physicians can only furnish prescriptions to addicts, and may not dispense the drugs to such persons at pleasure from stocks of their own.\n There is certainly nothing in this state enactment, as construed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, which interferes with the enforcement of the federal revenue law, and we agree with the state court that there is no conflict between the enactments such as will prevent the state from enforcing its own law upon the subject.\n It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

The bill avers that by the third article of a treaty concluded February 22, 1819, and ratified and proclaimed February 22, 1821 (8 Stat. 252), between the United States of America and the King of Spain, who had sovereignty over the territory now known as Texas, but then a part of Mexico, the boundary line \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 82]\n\u00a0\n between the two countries where formed by the Red river was established as following the south bank of that stream; that after Mexico had become independent, and on January 12, 1828, a treaty was concluded, and on April 5, 1832, ratified and proclaimed, between the United States of America and the United Mexican States by which the validity of the Treaty of 1819 was confirmed (8 Stat. 372); that in the year 1837 Texas was recognized as an independent republic, no longer under the power and jurisdiction of Mexico, and on April 25, 1838, a treaty was concluded, and in the same year ratified and proclaimed, between the United States and the Republic of Texas, by which the boundary as thus established was accepted by that Republic as binding (8 Stat. 511); and that under joint resolutions of Congress dated respectively March 1 and December 29, 1845 (5 Stat. 797; 9 Stat. 108), Texas was admitted into the Union as a state, with 'the territory properly included within and rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas.' That by act of Congress approved May 2, 1890, a temporary government was provided for a part of the territory adjoining said boundary on the north, now comprised in the state of Oklahoma, under the name of the territory of Oklahoma (chapter 182, 26 Stat. 81), and that by section 29 (page 93) the remaining part was designated as the Indian Territory; but that by section 25 (page 92), in view of the existence of a controversy between the United States and the state of Texas as to the ownership of what was known as Greer county, described as 'the tract of land lying between the North and South forks of the Red river where the Indian Territory and the state of Texas adjoin, east of the one hundredth degree of longitude,' it was provided that the act should not apply to that county until the title thereto had been adjudicated and determined to be in the United States; and, in order to provide for a speedy and final judicial determination of the controversy, the Attorney General \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 83]\n\u00a0\n was authorized and directed to commence in the name and behalf of the United States and prosecute to a final determination a suit in equity in this court against the state of Texas; that accordingly, at the October term, 1895 (1890), the Attorney General of the United States filed in this court an original bill against the state of Texas to determine whether the territory embraced within the then county of Greer was in the state of Texas or within the territory and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; that after a full hearing of said cause this court found, decided, and decreed that the territory east of the 100th meridian of longitude, west and south of the river now known as the North fork of Red river, and north of a line following westward, as prescribed by the Treaty of 1819, the course, and along the south bank, both of Red river and of the river now known as the Prairie Dog Town fork or South fork of Red river until such line meets the 100th meridian of longitude, constitutes no part of the territory properly included within or rightfully belonging to Texas at the time of the admission of that state into the Union, and was not within the limits nor under the jurisdiction of that state, but was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States of America (\n162 \nU.S. 1, 90\n, 91 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 725), and that afterwards, under act of Congress approved June 16, 1906 (chapter 3335, 34 Stat. 267), the inhabitants of the area constituting the territory of Oklahoma (including said Greer county) and the Indian Territory were admitted into the Union as the state of Oklahoma.\n The state of Texas appeared in the present suit, and filed an answer, denying that the Treaty of 1819 fixed the boundary at the South bank of the Red river; asserting, on the contrary, that the treaty, by its legal meaning and effect, fixed it in the middle of the main channel of that river; denying that the effect of the decree in the case of United States v. Texas was to determine that the south \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 84]\n\u00a0\n bank of Red river, or of the Prairie Dog Town fork or South fork of that river, constituted the boundary between the United States and Texas at any point; and setting up a counterclaim and other matters not necessary to be here repeated.\n The United States, by leave of the court, intervened, and by its petition of intervention set up an interest as trustee of Indian allottees with respect to certain portions of the bed of the Red river and as owner in its own right of a large part of the bed and of numerous islands therein; and supported the contentions of the state of Oklahoma as to the location of the boundary line by the true construction of theTreaty of 1819 and as to the effect of the final decree in United States v. Texas.\n At the same time it was brought to the attention of the court that because of the recent discovery and development of oil and gas deposits in the bed of the river adjacent to Wichita county, Tex., serious conflicts had arisen between parties claiming title from the state of Texas and others claiming title from the state of Oklahoma or under the mineral laws of the United States; and that there was danger of the exhaustion of the deposits of oil and gas pending the determination of the questions at issue between the parties to the cause, and danger of armed conflict between rival claimants under them; and thereupon, on motion of the United States, concurred in by the state of Oklahoma and consented to by the state of Texas, as to lands claimed in its proprietary capacity, we appointed a receiver to take possession of that part of the river bed lying between mid-channel and the south bank, and within the disputed oil field.\n Pending the receivership, by order of June 7, 1920, made pursuant to the suggestion of the parties, we set the cause down for hearing at the present term upon two questions of law, with leave to take testimony pertinent to the purpose. \n253 U.S. 471\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 580. \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 85]\n\u00a0\n The testimony was taken and returned, a hearing has been had, and the matter is now to be decided.\n The questions are as follows:\n'(1) Is the decree of this court in United States v. Texas, \n162 U.S. 1\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 725, final and conclusive upon the parties to this cause in so far as it declares that the Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain fixed the boundary along the south bank of Red river? (2) If said decree is not conclusive, then did the Treaty of 1819, construed in the light of pertinent public documents and acts, fix the boundary along the midchannel of Red river or along the south bank of said river?'\n\n The first is a question of res judicata, and, obviously, if it is answered in the affirmative, the second becomes immaterial.\n The general principle, applied in numerous decisions of this court, and definitely accepted in Southern Pacific R. R. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 49 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 18, is, that a question of fact or of law distinctly put in issue and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery or defense in a suit or action between parties sui juris is conclusively settled by the final judgment or decree therein so that it cannot be further litigated in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies whether the second suit be for the same or a different cause of action. As was declared by Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court in the case cited on page 49 of 168 U. S., on page 27 of 18 Sup. Ct. (42 L. Ed. 355):\n'This general rule is demanded by the very object for which civil courts have been established, which is to secure the peace and repose of society by the settlement of matters capable of judicial determination. Its enforcement is essential to the maintenance of social order; for, the aid of judicial tribunals would not be invoked for the vindication of rights of person and property, if, as between parties and their privies, conclusiveness did not attend the judgments of such tribunals in respect of \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 86]\n\u00a0\n all matters properly put in issue and actually determined by them.'\n\n In order to aid us in ascertaining whether the question of boundary location now at issue was settled by the decision and decree in the Greer County Case, the parties have stipulated that the entire record in that case, including pleadings, stipulations, testimony, briefs, and documents of every character, now on file in this court, and the orders and decrees of the court therein, are to be considered in evidence for all purposes. They have been examined and considered accordingly.\n The jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter of that suit- its original jurisdiction over a suit in equity brought by the United States against one of the states to determine the boundary between such state and a territory of the United States-was put at issue by a demurrer to the bill of complaint in that case, and decided in favor of the jurisdiction, United States v. Texas, \n143 U.S. 621\n, 641, et seq., 12 Sup. Ct. 488. It was set at rest when followed by the making of a final decree, United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1, 90\n, 91 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 725.\n That the court had jurisdiction over the parties is obvious from the fact that the suit was brought in behalf of the United States pursuant to an act of Congress (Act of May 2, 1890, c. 182,  25; 26 Stat. 81, 92), that a bill of complaint and an amended bill were filed, to each of which the state of Texas demurred, and also answered, and that the United States filed a replication (\n162 U.S. 21\n-23, 16 Sup. Ct. 725), and both parties introduced evidence and participated in the hearing.\n There is identity of parties between the former suit and the present one, so far as concerns the proprietary interest now set up by the United States. As to governmental jurisdiction, the state of Oklahoma has succeeded in part to the position formerly held by the United States, and therefore is in privity with it. \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 87]\n\u00a0\n The former decision was based upon final hearing, on issue joined between the parties and upon evidence taken by both; and, as stated, it resulted in a final decree (\n162 \nU.S. 90, 91\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 725).\n Therefore it remains only to consider whether the 'right, question, or fact' now in controversy-the location of the boundary line with respect to the course of the Red river, and whether by the true construction of the Treaty of 1819 its location is along the south bank or in mid-channel- was put in issue and directly determined in the former case. That the final decree purports to determine it is obvious from a reading of the language employed (\n162 U.S. 90\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 754):\n'That the territory east of the 100th meridian of longitude, west and south of the river now known as the north fork of Red river, and north of a line following westward, as prescribed by the treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain, the course, and along the south bank, both of Red river and of the river now known as the Prairie Dog Town fork or South fork of Red river until such line meets the 100th meridian of longitude-which territory is sometimes called Greer county-constitutes no part of the territory properly included within or rightfully belonging to Texas at the time of the admission of that state into the Union, and is not within the limits nor under the jurisdiction of that state, but is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States of America.'\n\n The literal meaning of this is not seriously disputed; but it is insisted that, so far as it describes the boundary line of the treaty as following the south bank of the river, it was outside the issues litigated, and hence is not conclusive upon the parties to this cause-in effect, that in construing the decree the words 'along the south bank' should be excluded from consideration. Clearly, the inclusion of those words amounted to a decision that the correctness of that particular definition of the boundary \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 88]\n\u00a0\n was within the issues in the cause. But we concede that, in a subsequent suit upon a different cause of action, the question whether the matter decided on the former occasion was within the issues then proper to be decided, or was presented and actually determined in the course of deciding those issues, is open to inquiry, and that, unless it be answered in the affirmative, the matter is not res judicata.\n What was involved and determined in the former suit is to be tested by an examination of the record and proceedings therein, including the pleadings, the evidence submitted, the respective contentions of the parties, and the findings and opinion of the court; there being no suggestion that this is a proper case for resorting to extrinsic evidence. Russell v. Place, \n94 U.S. 606\n, 608; Last Chance Mining Co. v. Tyler Mining Co., \n157 U.S. 683\n, 688, et seq., 15 Sup. Ct. 733; Baker v. Cummings, \n181 U.S. 117\n, 124-130, 21 Sup. Ct. 578; National Foundry, etc., v. Oconto Water Supply Co., \n183 \nU.S. 216, 234\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 111.\n The Act of May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. 81, 92), briefly recited the existence of a controversy between the United States and the state of Texas as to the ownership of the land known as Greer county, and directed the Attorney General to bring suit in this court in order that the rightful title to that land might be finally determined. Referring to this, and to the history and nature of the controversy, it is contended that the pleadings should be so construed as to confine the issue to the identification of one of the forks of the Red river with the Red river of the treaty. It is true that the principal matter in dispute was the claim of the United States to ownership of the tract of land lying between the forks and bounded on the west by the 100th meridian. But the bill and the amended bill, after reciting article 3 of the treaty defining the boundary line between the United States and Spain, by which both parties to the cause were bound, and recounting \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 89]\n\u00a0\n the history of the controversy, concluded with a prayer that the bill might be filed and Texas made a defendant thereto, 'to the end and for the purpose of determining and settling the true boundary line between the United States and the state of Texas, and to determine and put at rest questions which now exist as to whether the Prairie Dog Town fork or the North fork of Red river, as aforesaid, constitutes the true boundary line of the Treaty of 1819'; and that upon final hearing a decree might be entered, establishing complainant's rights as set up in the bill; and there was a prayer for general relief. The contention now made is based upon an unduly narrow interpretation of the act and of the pleading. Granting that the substantial controversy related to the ownership of and jurisdiction over the tract lying between the forks, it was essential to a complete and precise disposition of that controversy that the court should define with certainty the bounds of the tract. If it were to be awarded to the state of Texas, an accurate definition of its northerly boundary was essential; if to the United States, like accuracy in defining its southerly boundary was called for; in either case, the line to be defined was 'the true boundary line between the United States and the state of Texas.' And if, as suggested, the river is to be regarded as navigable ( upon which we express no opinion), so that a boundary line separating national territory from that of the state, if described as following the river, without more, would by implication follow the middle of the main navigable channel, as in a case between adjoining states (Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 239; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 171\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258), so much the more was specific mention of the bank essential to an accurate description of the tract in issue, if the bank was the true line instead of midchannel. And if at the termination of the suit, the line were left undefined, a ground of further controversy would remain; and it is as foreign to correct \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 90]\n\u00a0\n practice as to the principles of equity that a final decree should be pregnant with further litigation.\n Even less substantial is the suggestion that the language of section 25 of the Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 92) authorizing suit to determine the title to the tract 'lying between the North and South forks of the Red river,' etc., and the use of that phrase in the amended bill had the effect of excluding from the issue land south of the middle of the south fork. Upon so narrow an interpretation, the controversy might as well be confined to the upland between the forks, leaving the United States without claim to any part of the bed of the stream, if the south fork proved to be the river of the treaty. Of course, the phrase merely pointed out the tract in dispute, without attempting to delimit it.\n The contention that the evidence and the arguments in the Greer County Case raised no controversy as to whether the boundary followed the mid-channel or the south bank of the river is not well founded. The Treaty of 1819, and a mass of historical and other data bearing upon its proper interpretation, were before the court. It appeared that the treaty was negotiated at Washington between the Spanish Minister, Don Luis de Onis, and the United States Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams; M. de Neuville, the French Minister, acting at times as an intermediary. The state of Texas itself introduced authenticated extracts from the instructions of the Spanish Minister, and excerpts from correspondence between him and Mr. Adams, from which latter it appeared that the question whether the boundary should follow the middle of the Sabine and Red rivers, or the westerly bank of the former and the southerly bank of the latter, was one of the points under discussion; the Spanish Minister proposing the middle lines, Mr. Adams the banks.\n Furthermore, in the principal brief for the state of Texas, reference was made to entries in Mr. Adams' diary, found in his Memoirs, vol. 4, pp. 233-280, in connection \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 91]\n\u00a0\n with which the brief declared:\n'An objection was long persisted in by Spain that instead of the banks of the rivers named being boundaries the middle of the river should be the dividing line [Adams, supra]. This objection was at last abandoned,' etc.\n\n The diary itself, in the pages thus referred to, abounds in statements to the effect that the representative of Spain, during the course of the negotiation, insisted that the middle of the rivers should be taken for the boundary, Mr. Adams firmly insisting upon 'the western and southern banks,' and at last prevailing. J. Q. Adams' Memoirs, vol. 4, pp. 255, 256, 261, 264, 266, 267, 270. It is true these references were made by counsel for Texas principally with the object of showing the important part that the Melish Map (mentioned in the treaty) played in the negotiations; but it is impossible to escape the conclusion that both counsel and the court understood that the question whether the boundary line, where it followed the Sabine and Red rivers, should be so located as to establish the United States as owner of the rivers or so as to divide the ownership between the United States and Spain, figured to an important extent in the negotiations, was disposed of by the treaty, and hence was vital to the correct location of the boundary line as between the litigants. If the point was not controverted, it was only because counsel for Texas in effect conceded that the treaty line ran along the south bank of the Red river. It may have seemed, at that time, a matter of no great moment.\n Finally, the precise matter was discussed in the opinion of the court, and was made the subject of a finding which was carried into the final decree. In the course of an outline of the diplomatic correspondence and negotiations that preceded the making of the treaty, the court said (\n162 U.S. 27\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 729 [40 L. Ed. 867]):\n'The Spanish Minister required that 'the boundary between the two countries shall be the middle of the rivers, and that the navigation of the said rivers \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 92]\n\u00a0\n shall be common to both countries.' Mr. Adams replied that the United States had always intended that 'the property of the river should belong to them,' and he insisted on that point 'as an essential condition, as the means of avoiding all collision, and as a principle adopted henceforth by the United States in its treaties with its neighbors.' He agreed, however, 'that the navigation of the said rivers to the sea shall be common to both people\"-citing Annals of Congress, Appendix, 15th Cong., 2d Sess., 2120, 2021, 2123\n\n\n\n The opinion then proceeded to set forth (\n162 U.S. 27\n-29, 16 Sup. Ct. 729 [40 L. Ed. 867]) the third and fourth articles of the treaty, in the former of which occurs the language that Mr. Adams had insisted upon as carrying out the purposes of the United States that 'the property of the river should belong to them'; and at a later point the opinion declared ( \n162 U.S. 37\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 733 [40 L. Ed. 867]):\n'The two governments certainly intended that the line should be run from the Gulf along the western bank of the Sabine river, and after it reached Red river that it should follow the course of that river, leaving both rivers within the United States.'\n\n And, having decided the case in favor of the United States, the court embodied in the final decree a description of the boundary line, in terms quoted above.\n To sum it up, we find that the question of the true location of the boundary between the territory of the United States and Texas where it followed the Red river bordering upon Greer county, and the question whether the boundary followed the middle or the south bank of the river, were within the issues made by the pleadings, and so recognized by both parties, as well as by the court; that, by the concession of both, the location was to be determined according to the true effect and meaning of the Treaty of 1819; that in elucidation of the matter the treaty, and much historical evidence of the negotiations that led up to it, were introduced, discussed by counsel in argument, and referred to in the opinion of the court; \n\n[256 U.S. 70, 93]\n\u00a0\n and that the point was directly determined by the court and the determination made a part of its final decree. By every test that properly can be applied, the matter is res judicata.\n And, of course it not only concludes the parties with respect to that part of the boundary which borders upon what was called Greer county, but settles the construction of article 3 of the Treaty of 1819 as to the entire course of the Red river where it marks the boundary between the territory then owned by the United States and that of the state of Texas.\n Having reached this conclusion upon the first of the two questions proposed for decision, it is unnecessary to consider the second, which is whether the treaty, by proper construction, fixes the boundary along the midchannel or the south bank. The matter being res judicata, as the result of the decree in the former suit, it is of no consequence whether it was correctly decided or not. We say this without intending to intimate the least doubt about the propriety of that decision.\n The parties may submit within 30 days a proper form of decree for carrying this decision into effect.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justic CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., and George L. Ingraham and John Quinn, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to establish a claim to and prevent a sale of 14,900 shares of the capital stock of the Botany Worsted Mills, a New Jersey corporation, which were seized by the Alien Property Custodian under the Trading with the Enemy Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2a-3115 1\/2j) as the property of a German corporation called Kammgarnspinnerei Stoehr & Co., Aktiengesellschaft. The plaintiff is a citizen of the United States, residing in New York, and sues in the right of Stoehr & Sons, Incorporated, a New York corporation, of which he is a stockholder; his asserted justification for so suing being that the directors of the corporation are agents of the Alien Property Custodian, and so far under his control that it would be useless to request them to bring the suit.\n The grounds for relief urged in the bill are that the shares, although seized and proposed to be sold as the \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n property of the German corporation, are in truth the property of the New York corporation; that, even if it does not own them, it has a substantial interest in them under a pre-war contract between it and the German corporation; that the shares cannot be taken from it consistently with due process of law as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, save through a judicial proceeding, wherein it has a right and an opportunity to be heard; that the shares were seized and are about to be sold without any such proceeding or hearing, and in violation of subsisting treaty provisions; and that the seizure as made did not conform to designated provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, and the sale as proposed will not be in accord with other provisions of the act.\n After a full hearing the District Court overruled the objections urged against the initial seizure; found from the proofs that the German corporation was the beneficial owner, that the New York corporation had no actual interest in the shares, and that the contract between those corporations, stressed by the plaintiff, 'was not intended to represent the real purpose of the parties at all, but to serve as a cover for another purpose'; and as a result of the findings the court held that neither the plaintiff nor his corporation was entitled to any relief, and accordingly dismissed the bill. The plaintiff then asked and was allowed a direct appeal to this court. His assignments of error cover all the grounds on which the seizure and proposed sale were attacked in the bill.\n We shall assume, as did the District Court, that a stockholder may bring a suit such as this in the right of his corporation, where there are circumstances justifying such representative action, and that the plaintiff has shown sufficient reason for suing in that capacity.

Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 126; Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 305.\n It is with parts of the act which relate to captures on land that we now are concerned. They invest the President with extensive powers respecting the sequestration, custody and disposal of enemy property. By section 5 (Comp. St. 1918 Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 c) he is in terms authorized to exercise 'any' of these powers 'through such officer or officers as he shall direct.' By section 6 (section 3115 1\/2 cc) he is authorized to appoint and 'prescribe the duties of' an officer to be known as the Alien Property Custodian. By section 7c, as amended November 4, 1918, direct provision for sequestering enemy property is made as follows:\n'If the President shall so require any money or other property including ... choses in action, and rights and claims of every character and description owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit, of an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owing or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian; and all property thus acquired shall be held, administered and disposed of as elsewhere provided in this act. ...\n\n'Whenever any such property shall consist of shares of stock or other beneficial interest in any corporation, \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n association, or company or trust, it shall be the duty of the corporation, association, or company or trustee or trustees issuing such shares or any certificates or other instruments representing the same or any other beneficial interest to cancel upon its, his, or their books all shares of stock or other beneficial interest standing upon its, his, or their books in the name of any person or persons, or held for, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of any person or persons who shall have been determined by the President, after investigation, to be an enemy or ally of enemy, and which shall have been required to be conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him, and in lieu thereof to issue certificates or other instrument for such shares or other beneficial interest to the Alien Property Custodian or otherwise, as the Alien Property Custodian shall require.\n\n'The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any money or other property heretofore or hereafter conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or required so to be, or seized by him shall be that provided by the terms of this act, and in the event of sale or other disposition of such property by the Alien Property Custodian, shall be limited to and enforced against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.'\n\n By section 9 (section 3115 1\/2 e), as twice amended, any one, 'not an enemy or ally of enemy,' claiming any interest, right or title in any money or other property so sequestered and held may give notice of his claim and institute a suit in equity against the Custodian or the Treasurer, as the case may be, to establish and enforce his claim; and where suit is brought the money or property is to be retained by the Custodian or in the Treasury to abide the final decree. By section 12, as amended March 28, 1918, the Custodian is \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n clothed with 'all of the powers of a commonlaw trustee' in respect of all enemy property coming into his hands and is given authority, subject to the President's supervision, to manage and dispose of the same, by sale or otherwise, as if he were the absolute owner, save as the power of disposal may be suspended by a suit under section 9. As respects the ultimate disposition of the property or its proceeds section 12 says:\n'After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money or other property received and held by the Alien Property Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury, shall be settled as Congress shall direct.'\n\n The President, by orders of October 12, 1917, and February 26, 1918, committed to the Alien Property Custodian the executive administration of section 7c, including the power to determine after investigation whether property was enemy-owned, etc., and to require the surrender or seizure of such as he should determine was so owned. In exercising this power the Custodian after investigation determined, in substance, that the shares now in question, which then stood in the name of the New York corporation on the books of the Botany Worsted Mills, belonged to the German corporation, that it was an enemy not holding a presidential license, and that the New York corporation held the shares for its benefit; and in further exercising this power the Custodian seized the shares and required the Botany Worsted Mills to transfer them to his name on its books in accordance with the provision in section 7c before quoted.\n One objection urged by the plaintiff is that the seizure permitted by the act is confined to money or property 'which the President after investigation shall determine' is enemy-owned, etc., and that here there was no such determination by the President, but only by the Custodian. Whether the objection would be good if it turned entirely on the words of section 7c, on which the plaintiff relies, we need \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n not consider; for they obviously are qualified and explained by section 5 which very plainly enables the President to exercise his power under section 7c 'through such officer or officers as he may direct.' By the orders already noticed the President directed that this power be exercised through the Alien Property Custodian. It therefore is as if the words relied on had been 'which the President, acting through the Alien Property Custodian, shall determine after investigation' is enemy-owned, etc. In short, a personal determination by the President is not required; he may act through the Custodian, and a determination by the latter is in effect the act of the President. Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 214, 65 L. Ed. --; The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 109.\n The plaintiff further objects that the shares, although claimed by and standing in the name of the New York corporation, which concededly was neither an enemy nor an ally of an enemy, were seized and transferred to the name of the Alien Property Custodian in virtue of a determination by an executive officer in an ex parte administrative proceeding that they belonged to an alien enemy-the gist of the objection being that the shares could not be taken from the New York corporation consistently with due process of law without first according it a hearing on its claim in a court of justice. The objection rests on erroneous assumptions and is not tenable.\n That Congress in time of war may authorize and provide for the seizure and sequestration through executive channels of property believed to be enemy-owned, if adequate provision be made for a return in case of mistake, is not debatable. Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, supra. There is no warrant for saying that the enemy ownership must be determined judicially before the property can be seized; and the practice has been the other way. The present act commits the determination of that question to the President, or the representative through whom \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n he acts, but it does not make his action final. On the contrary, it distinctly reserves to any claimant who is neither an enemy nor an ally of an enemy a right to assert and establish his claim by a suit in equity unembarrassed by the precedent executive determination. Not only so, but pending the suit, which the claimant may bring so promptly after the seizure as he chooses, the property is to be retained by the Custodian to abide the result and, if the claimant prevails, is to be forthwith returned to him. Thus there is provision for the return of property mistakenly sequestered; and we have no hesitation in pronouncing it adequate, for it enables the claimant as of right, to obtain a full hearing on his claim in a court having power to enforce it if found meritorious.\n That the shares were transferred to the Custodian's name does not affect the question, for, considering the nature of the property, that was but an incident of an effective seizure and, if a return of the shares were ordered, a retransfer would follow as of course.\n Treating this as a suit under section 9-the plaintiff having filed a notice of claim under that section-the next question is: Has the New York corporation such an interest in the shares as entitles it, or the plaintiff in its right, to demand that they be freed from the seizure? Whether it has any interest turns on the effect to be given to the contract between it and the German corporation, under which the plaintiff insists it became the owner or acquired a substantial interest. The District Court, as we have indicated, found that the contract was not intended to affect the ownership as between the two corporations, but to serve as a cover for something else, and that after the contract the German corporation remained as it had been before, the sole beneficial owner. The facts bearing on the question are as follows:\n At the beginning of the World War and during its early stages the Stoehr family, consisting of a father and three \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 247]\n\u00a0\n sons, were engaged in business in New York as copartners under the name of Stoehr & Sons. The father and one son were German subjects residing in Germany; one son, Hans E. Stoehr, was a German subject residing in the United States; and the remaining son, Max W. Stoehr, was a naturalized citizen of the United States residing therein. All were shareholders in the German corporation, and the father and son in Germany were among its chief officers. All were directors of the Botany Worsted Mills, and Hans E. Stoehr and Max W. Stoehr were directing and controlling its affairs, one being its treasurer and the other its secretary. It was a manufacturing concern with large holdings, had a well-established and extensive business, had been paying large dividends, and gave promise of continuing to do so. The German corporation acquired the 14,900 shares in that company long prior to the war, and in 1915, after the war became flagrant in Europe, transferred them to Hans E. Stoehr and Max W. Stoehr, be be held in trust for it as the beneficial owner. Stoehr & Sons, the copartnership, also had 5,690 shares in that company, and these, with the 14,900 constituted a majority of its stock.\n Diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany were severed February 3, 1917, and, as was commonly understood, war between them was then imminent. The Stoehrs took that view and began to adjust their affairs accordingly. They caused the New York corporation to be organized, and on February 19, 1917, transferred to it the entire assets and business of their copartnership, taking in exchange all of its capital stock and putting the same in a five-year voting trust as a means of protecting and preventing a severance of their interests. On the following day, February 20, 1917, the contract relating to the 14,900 shares in the Botany Worsted Mills was made, and the shares were immediately transferred on its books to the name of the New York corporation. \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 248]\n\u00a0\n In that transaction Hans E. Stoehr acted for the German corporation and the directors of the New York corporation for it-the directors being Hans E. Stoehr, Max W. Stoehr, George G. Roehlig, and Alfred de Liagre, the last two being relatives of the Stoehrs. The attorney who had advised and assisted them in transferring the copartnership assets and business also advised and assisted them in this. The shares were worth approximately $5, 000,000; and yet the initial payment was only $5,000, and even that was paid by mere book entries. The full stipulated price was the book value of the shares, with good will and other intangible assets eliminated, and was payable in five future annual instalments. The stock certificates, transferred as just stated, were left in the custody of the German corporation as collateral security. If payment was not made when due, nor within 60 days after demand, the shares were to be retransferred, the $5, 000 was to be retained by the German corporation, and neither corporation was to have 'any further claim against the other' by reason of the contract. Possibly the stipulated price was less than the actual value; but, however this may have been, the assets and situation of the New York corporation were such that it reasonably could not have been expected to make the required payments.\n After the contract the dividends accruing on the shares were not paid to the New York corporation, but were credited to it in a 'special' account on the books of the Botany Worsted Mills, this being directed by Hans E. Stoehr, president of the former and treasurer of the latter.\n War was declared by Congress April 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 1), and the Trading with the Enemy Act was passed October 6th following. Up to the latter date no preparation was made for making the first payment under the contract although it was to be about $1,000,000. Under the act it became the duty of every domestic corporation to report fully whether it owed any money to or held any property \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 249]\n\u00a0\n for an enemy, and also whether any of its shares were owned by or held for an enemy. In the report of the New York corporation, signed by Max W. Stoehr, the 14,900 shares covered by the contract were not reported as held for the German corporation, nor was the stipulated price, or any part thereof, reported as owing to that corporation. But in the report of the Botany Worsted Mills, signed by Thomas Prehn, it was said that that company had 'reason to believe' that the German corporation had an interest in the shares. This led to an insistent call for full information, and resulted in some correspondence and several conferences at the Alien Property Custodian's office, in all of which Herbert Heyn represented the New York corporation and the Botany Worsted Mills-he being the attorney who had advised and assisted the Stoehrs in adjusting their copartnership affairs and in making the contract. February 5, 1918, while Heyn was attending one of the conferences, Hans E. Stoehr, as president of the New York corporation and treasurer of theBotany Worsted Mills, sent to him, for use at the conference, a list of the latter company's stockholders, in which the German corporation was described as having 14,900 shares and the New York corporation as having only 5,685. In an accompanying letter he said, 'The majority of the stock of the Botany Worsted Mills ... is held by parties who are alien enemies'-a statement which was true if the 14,900 shares belonged to the German corporation, and not true if they belonged to the New York corporation. Four days later Heyn, with the approval in writing of Hans E. Stoehr as such president and treasurer, wrote to the Alien Property Custodian, saying of the purpose with which the New York corporation was formed:\n'The immediate occasion for the organization of the corporation in February, 1917, was this: It was assumed that, if there was a declaration of war between the United States and Germany, the partnership [of Stoehr & Sons] would probably have to cease , \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 250]\n\u00a0\n being dissolved by reason of the alien enemy character of Eduard Stoehr, the father, and Geo. Stoehr, the brother; the results of such dissolution being of course obviously unfortunate and conceivably disastrous'\n\n -and saying of the 14,900 shares:\n'Regarding the contract for the purchase of said 14,900 shares of Stoehr & Sons, Incorporated, from Stoehr & Co., of Leipzig, Germany, it has been fully explained that the control of Botany might be imperiled by a state of war, because the voting right on stock of alien enemies or in which alien enemies had the beneficial interests ( as was the case with said 14,900 shares) was doubtful under the decisions of the courts, and if deprived of the voting right, the control of Botany might be lost. This contract was made with reference to the control of Botany as between its stockholders and had of course no reference to the status of such control so far as the alien Property Custodian is concerned. Such status is not affected whether such shares are in Stoehr & Co., the Leipzig corporation, or in Stoehr & Sons, Incorporated, the New York corporation. ... While Botany is managed in this country, considerably more than a majority of its stock is controlled by alien enemy interests.'\n\n Max W. Stoehr, the plaintiff, was a director and the secretary of the New York corporation from the time it was organized until October 14, 1918. He participated in making the contract relating to the 14,900 shares and signed it as secretary. The shares were seized in April, 1918, and he knew of the seizure. The other directors at that time were new. He regularly attended their meetings, but did not suggest to them that the corporation had an interest in the shares. At a meeting in August, 1918, an attorney who had been looking into the contract made an oral report, in the course of which he called in question the purpose with which the contract was made and said it 'would not hold water.' Max W. Stoehr, although present, said nothing in support of the contract. Not until he \n\n[255 U.S. 239, 251]\n\u00a0\n ceased to be an officer of the corporation did he manifest any opposition to the seizure. His only explanation of his silence while he remained a director is that he feared he would lose that position if he took any other course.\n The District Court, after reviewing the proofs at length, concluded that the contract was not prompted by commercial motives, nor based on an estimate of mutual advantages, and was not intended as a genuine business transaction, but was made to avoid inconveniences which otherwise might ensue from a state of war; and that the parties intended to leave the beneficial ownership in the German corporation and not to pass it to the New York corporation. We reach the same conclusion. On no other theory can the acts of those who were concerned be explained or their declarations reconciled. The mere recitation of the facts makes this so plain that we refrain from any special discussion of them.\n The treaty provisions relied on (articles 23 and 24, 8 Stat. 174) relate only to the rights of merchants of either country 'residing in the other' when war arises, and therefore are without present application.\n Of the objections specially directed against the proposed sale, it is enough to observe that as the New York corporation does not own or have any interest in the shares it is not in a position to criticize or attack the sale; and of course a stockholder suing in its right is in no better position.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSULLIVAN v.

Compilation of Treaties in Force 1904, 375 (Malloy); 31 Stats. U. S. 1939.\n The case arises from the following facts:\n Peter Martin died at Osawatomie, Kan., January 29, 1915, owing real estate situated in the county of Saline, Kan. He left surviving him certain relatives, among others a sister Margaret Ingoldsby, a resident of the township of Sheffield, county of Lennox Addington, Province of Ontario, Canada. After the death of Peter Martin, and on July 28, 1916, Margaret Ingoldsby died at her home in Canada, and by her last will and testament, duly probated, she named the appellee, Jane Kidd, her sole devisee and legatee. The real estate in Kansas has been sold in partition sale, and the question to be decided is whether Jane Kidd, thus holding by devise the interest of Margaret Ingoldsby, is entitled to succeed to the undivided one seventh of the estate of Peter Martin.\n Primarily the devolution of the estate, it being situated in the state of Kansas, would be determined by the laws of that state. Blythe v. Hinckley, \n180 U.S. 333\n, and previous cases in this court cited and quoted on page 341 et seq., 21 Sup. Ct. 390, on page 394 et seq. (45 L. Ed. 557). Under the Constitution and laws of Kansas, Margaret Ingoldsby, an alien, was incapable of inheriting, and the estate would pass to the brothers and sisters and their representatives who were native citizens. Johnson v. Olson, 92 Kan. 819, 142 Pac. 256, L. R. A. 1915E, 327. \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n The right of Jane Kidd to succeed to the interest of Margaret Ingoldsby is said to arise from the fact that the latter was, although a citizen and resident of Canada, a British subject, and entitled to the succession because of the Treaty of March 2, 1899. The District Court sustained this contention. Pertinent provisions of the treaty are:\n'ARTICLE I.\n\n'Where, on the death of any person holding real property (or property not personal), within the territories of one of the contracting parties, such real property would, by the laws of the land pass to a citizen or subject of the other, were he not disqualified by the laws of the country where such real property is situated, such citizen or subject shall be allowed a term of three years in which to sell the same, this term to be reasonably prolonged if circumstances render it necessary, and to withdraw the proceeds thereof, without restraint or interference, and exempt from any succession, probate or administrative duties or charges other than those which may be imposed in like cases upon the citizens or subjects of the country from which such proceeds may be drawn.\n\n'ARTICLE II.\n\n'The citizens or subjects of each of the contracting parties shall have full power to dispose of their personal property within the territories of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise; and their heirs, legatees, and donees, being citizens or subjects of the other contracting party, whether resident or nonresident, shall succeed to their said personal property, and may take possession thereof either by themselves or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their pleasure, paying such duties only as the citizens or subjects of the country where the property lies shall be liable to pay in like cases.\n\n ... \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n 'ARTICLE IV.\n'The stipulations of the present convention shall not be applicable to any of the colonies or foreign possessions of Her Britannic Majesty unless notice to that effect shall have been given, on behalf of any such colony or foreign possession by Her Britannic Majesty's representative at Washington to the United States Secretary of State, within one year from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of the present convention.\n\n'It is understood that under the provisions of this article, Her Majesty can in the same manner give notice of adhesion on behalf of any British protectorate or sphere of influence, or on behalf of the island of Cyprus, in virtue of the convention of the 4th of June, 1878, between Great Britain and Turkey.\n\n'The provisions of this convention shall extend and apply to any territory or territories pertaining to or occupied and governed by the United States beyond the seas, only upon notice to that effect being given by the representative of the United States at London, by direction of the treaty making power of the United States.\n\n'ARTICLE V.\n\n'In all that concerns the right of disposing of every kind of property, real or personal, citizens or subjects of each of the high contracting parties shall in the dominions of the other enjoy the rights which are or may be accorded to the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation.\n\n'ARTICLE VI.\n\n'The present convention shall come into effect ten days after the day upon which the ratifications are exchanged, and shall remain in force for ten years after such exchange. In case neither of the high contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n the expiration of the said period of ten years, of the intention to terminate the present convention, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the high contracting parties shall have given such notice.\n\n'The United States or Her Britannic Majesty shall also have the right separately to terminate the present convention at any time on giving twelve months' notice to that effect in regard to any British colony, foreign possession, or dependency, as specified in article IV, which may have acceded thereto.'\n\n The case was argued and submitted at the last term of this court. It was ordered reinstated with notice to the Attorneys General of the United States and of the state of Kansas. The case has been reargued. The Solicitor General presented the views of the State Department of the United States, and submitted a brief in behalf of the government.\n There are opposing views of the treaty, one taken by the British, and the other by the American, government. The view of the former being that British subjects, resident of Canada, or elsewhere, are entitled to inherit property in any state of the United States, and citizens of the United States are entitled to inherit in Great Britain and its possessions and colonies, provided as to the latter, that notice has been given under article 4 of the treaty of adhesion to the terms of the convention as to such colonies and possession. The American contention is stated by the Solicitor General, and appears by a communication from the Secretary of State of October 2, 1920, sent in response to the invitation of the Solicitor General, and now on the files of the Department of Justice. The Secretary of State sets forth that it is the view of this government that British subjects, citizens and residents of Canada, do not inherit in the United States by virtue of the stipulations of the treaty, because as to the Dominion \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n of Canada no notice of adhesion to the same has been given as is required by the stipulations of article 4. It hence appears that the one contention is that the notice required by article 4 has a territorial effect only, and when given brings such territory into the operative force of the treaty as to the property situated therein; the other, that as to subjects and citizens, the notice is required to bring residents and property within the operative effect of the treaty.\n Applied to the concrete case, the American contention is that Margaret Ingoldsby was not entitled to inherit in Kansas by the terms of this treaty because notice of adherence for the Dominion of Canada was not given. The communication of the State Department to the Solicitor General shows that the American government is ready, and has expressed its willingness to take up the matter of extending the treaty provisions to the Dominion of Canada, notwithstanding the fact that the stipulated time for notice has expired.\n Writers of authority agree that treaties are to be interpreted upon the principles which govern the interpretation of contracts in writing between individuals, and are to be executed in the utmost good faith, with a view to making effective the purposes of the high contracting parties; that all parts of a treaty are to receive a reasonable construction with a view to giving a fair operation to the whole. Moore, International Law Digest, vol. 5, p. 249. At the time of the negotiation of the treaty Great Britain had numerous colonies and possessions, and the United States had recently acquired certain islands beyond the seas. Concerning these the contracting parties made the stipulations contained in article 4, adding the right to give like notice in behalf of any British protectorate, or sphere of influence, or on behalf of the island of Cyprus by virtue of the covention of June 4, 1878, between Great Britain and Turkey As to the islands beyond \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n the seas occupied or governed by the United States, they were to come within the terms of the treaty only upon notice to that effect by direction of the treaty making power of the United States.\n If the contention of the appellee be correct, it necessarily follows that as to British possessions, the inhabitants thereof being British subjects, had nothing to gain by giving notice which article 4 specifically required, for as to them their rights had been secured by articles 1 and 2 of the treaty. Applying this construction to the instant case, Canadians, while residents of the Dominion and citizens of a self regulating and self governing community, acquired by virtue of this treaty as British subjects the right to inherit in every state of the American Union regardless of local laws; this while citizens of the United States acquired no corresponding right to inherit in the Dominion of Canada until notice be given; a matter entirely beyond the control of American authority. American right to inherit in Canada became a matter of grace on the part of the other contracting nation when it saw fit to grant it by signifying its adhesion to the treaty. Such construction is inconsistent with the general purpose and object of such conventions to secure equality in exchange of privileges and reciprocity in rights granted and secured. Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 271\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 295.\n The fact that Canada as a self governing dependency, in the exercise of the legislative power which is hers, has seen fit to give aliens the right to inherit, adds nothing to the argument in favor of the appellee. The Dominion of Canada has not the treatymaking power. Whatever the Dominion may see fit to do in the exercise of its own legislative authority cannot affect the right of a state of the American Union to determine for herself whether aliens shall inherit property within her borders. The construction insisted upon by the United States makes for the exchange of reciprocal rights under the provisions \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n of the treaty, and when the required notice is given, British subjects resident of Canada would have property rights in the United States similar to those accorded citizens of the United States in Canada. That notice was deemed essential to the security of rights of British subjects, resident of the colonies, is shown by the practice which has followed the making of the supplementary convention of 1902 (Treaties in Force 1904, 379; 32 U. S. Stats. p. 1864) extending for 12 months from July 28, 1901, the time fixed in article 4 of the Treaty of March 2, 1899, for the notification of accession to that convention by British colonies or foreign possessions. In a note to this treaty, published in Treaties in Force 1904, supra, it appears that most of the British colonies and possessions have given notice of adhesion to the treaty of 1899.\n The significance of article 6 is important. In this article provision is made for the right of the United States or the British government to terminate separately the convention by twelve months' notice to that effect in regard to any British colony, foreign possession or dependency, as specified in article 4, which may have acceded to the convention. This article lends strong support to the argument that only colonies or possessions which accede to the convention are to have the benefit thereof; such rights, recognized as acquired by accession, being subject to termination by the withdrawal provision of article 6.\n Nor are we impressed with the argument that Canadian citizens, being also British subjects, are entitled to inherit in Kansas by virtue of the most favored nation clause. That clause has been held in the practice of this country to be one not extending rights acquired by treaties containing it because of reciprocal benefits expressly conferred in conventions with other nations in exchange for rights or privileges given to this government. This clause cannot overcome the specific provisions of article \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n 4 making adhesion to the treaty necessary in order to bring citizens and property of colonies and possessions within the benefits of the treaty.\n We are unable to see that the construction of this treaty is aided by the argument of counsel in the supplemental brief of the appellee that Lord Salisbury for the British government insisted upon the construction which they contend for in relation to a similar covention with Japan. We find nothing in the archives of the Department of State to show that this insistence was brought forward in the course of negotiations or in any manner came to the attention of the American representative, Mr. Hay, who negotiated this treaty with Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British representative.\n The American government upon a message from the President for the purpose of securing the consent of the Senate, as we learn from public documents on file in the State Department, has with the consent of the Senate extended the provisions of the convention of 1899 to Proto Rico and has so notified the British government. We are advised by the letter of the Secretary of State of October 2, 1920 (on file in the Department of Justice), that this government is ready to take up with the British government the matter of extension of the treaty provisions to Hawaii and the Dominion of Canada.\n While the question of the construction of treaties is judicial in its nature, and courts when called upon to act should be careful to see that international engagements are faithfully kept and observed, the construction placed upon the treaty before us and consistently adhered to by the Executive Department of the Government, charged with the supervision of our foreign relations, should be given much weight. Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 468\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397. See, also, Castro v. De Uriarte (D. C.) 16 Fed. 93, 98 (opinion by Judge Addison Brown).\n Taking the view which we have here expressed of the \n\n[254 U.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n real purpose of the treaty as evidenced by its terms, which is strengthened by the practices of both governments in pursuance of it, we reach the conclusion that for lack of notice of the adhesion of Canada to the terms of the treaty, the law of Kansas was not superseded in favor of British subjects resident in Canada, and it determined the rights of aliens to inherit lands in that state.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUPREME TRIBE OF BEN HUR v. CAUBLE(1921)\nNo. 274\nArgued: Decided: March 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 356, 357]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles M. McCabe, of Crawfordsville, Ind., and Samuel D. Miller, William H. Thompson, and Frank C. Dailey, all of Indianapolis, Ind ., for appellant.\n Mr. William C. Bachelder, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon the question of jurisdiction. Jud. Code,  238 ( Comp. St.  1215). Appellant is a fraternal benefit association organized under the laws of the state of Indiana. It filed a bill against Aurelia J. Cauble and others, citizens and residents of Indiana, to enjoin them from prosecuting in the state courts certain suits which, it is averred, would relitigate questions settled by a decree of the United States District Court for Indiana; it being the contention that all the members in Class A in the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, including the appellees, were bound and concluded by the federal decree.\n The bill was filed upon the theory that it is ancillary in character, and justifies a decree to protect the rights \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 358]\n\u00a0\n adjudicated in the original proceeding. A motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was sustained. (D. C.) 264 Fed. 247.\n The ancillary bill alleges that the questions decided in the original suit determined:\n\n\n (1)\n The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to create a new class of benefit certificate holders known as Class B. (The membership in such society up to July 1, 1908, having been in the class thereafter to be designated as Class A.) (2) The right of the society to determine that all benefit certificates issued after July 1, 1908, should be Class B certificates, and that no Class A certificates should be issued after that date, and no new members taken into Class A, from that time. (3) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to require members of Class B to pay different rates for their insurance from members of Class A. (4) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to require that the mortuary funds of the two classes be kept separate and distinct, and that the death losses occurring therein, should be paid out of the funds of each class respectively. (5) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to authorize members of Class A to transfer, upon a written application therefor to Class B, and to take with them into Class B. their interest in the mortuary, and other funds, of the society, created, or arising prior to July 1, 1908, and requiring the Class B members to pay a monthly payment and rate in excess of that paid by Class A members. (6) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to require members remaining in Class A, and not transferring to Class B, to pay a sufficient number of monthly payments, or assessments, to meet the death losses in Class A. (7) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to use the expense fund of the society for the purpose of creating Class B, and induce Class A members to transfer to Class B, and to secure new members in Class B. (8) Whether \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 359]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur had used the expense fund in a manner justified by its constitution and by-laws and a general examination of expenditures which had been made by that society, out of its expense fund, and the purpose for which these expenditures had been made, and whether any of them were made in violation of the rights of Class A members. (9) The right of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to use its expense fund, including all questions as to whether payments made out of it were equitable and just, or inequitable, wrongful and unlawful; and the question of whether the maintenance of a general expense fund, and the payments of the entire expenses of the society therefrom, was fair, just and legal. (10) Whether the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur had wrongfully, or unlawfully inaugurated a campaign to persuade and induce the members of the society belonging to Class A to give up their certificates in Class A, and to apply for and procure membership and certificates in Class B; or whether the action of the society, and its officers in that connection, was rightful, just and equitable. (11) The question of whether the rates in Class A, in effect prior to July 1, 1908, were adequate, or inadequate, or whether they were sufficient to provide for the current death losses in Class A, and the expenses of the society; or whether it was necessary, in order to prevent the insolvency of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, to create a new class, and induce the members of the old class, in so far as it was possible to induce them, to transfer to the new class, and the right of the society to take all action necessary for this purpose.\n Other details of the reorganization are set forth, and it is averred that in the original suit it was finally determined and adjudged that the reorganization adopted by the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur was valid and binding upon all the members of the society, including the members known as Class A. \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 360]\n\u00a0\n The ancillary bill alleges that the commencement of the suit in the state courts of Indiana will have the effect to relitigate questions conclusively adjudicated against the defendants as members of Class A in the action in the United States District Court; that to permit them to do so would destroy the effect of the decree rendered in that suit; that in the several suits commenced in the state courts plaintiffs therein challenged the rights of the society to create Class B; and that the plan of reorganization of the society to create Class B, and the questions of fact and law involved in the causes in the state court are the same questions, and none other than those conclusively adjudged and determined in the main suit.\n The District Judge dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction upon the following certificate:\n'I hereby certify that I dismissed the ancillary bill of complaint in the above cause of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur v. Aurelia J. Cauble et al., solely because of the lack of jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Indiana to entertain said ancillary bill of complaint.\n\n'I dismissed said ancillary bill of complaint upon a motion filed by the defendants thereto and also upon my own motion.\n\n'The jurisdictional question arose as follows:\n\n'On April 16, 1913, George Balme, a citizen of the state of Kentucky, and five hundred and twenty-three other complainants residing in fifteen different states of the Union outside of the state of Indiana, and one complainant residing in the Dominion of Canada, filed their bill of complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Indiana against the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, a fraternal beneficiary society organized under laws of the state of Indiana with its principal office at Crawfordsville in said state and district aforesaid, and its officers, all citizens and residents of the state of Indiana, \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 361]\n\u00a0\n to enjoin what was claimed to be an unlawful use of trust funds of said defendant, Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur in which all the complainants and other members of Class A of said Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur had a common but indivisible interest, and attacking a plan of reorganization adopted by the supreme legislative body of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur to prevent threatened insolvency and disruption of said society; the suit was a class suit brought and prosecuted for the benefit of all members of Class A of said society of whom there were more than seventy thousand at the time of the commencement of said suit, to wit, April 16, 1913; an answer was filed by the defendants, setting up a full answer to the facts averred in the bill of complaint; a long hearing was had before the master, the master filed a written report, and in this report it was found that this was strictly a true class suit, presenting questions of common interest to all the members of Class A and affecting their joint interests in funds and in internal management of the society, written exceptions were filed thereto both by complainants and defendants, and a final decree was entered, dismissing complainants' bill of complaint for want of equity, which said decree has never been appealed from, modified or vacated, but is still in full force and effect. No Indiana members of the society intervened or were made parties to the suit by any subsequent proceeding prior to the filing of said ancillary bill in said cause.\n\n'In 1919 the defendants to the ancillary bill, all being residents of the state of Indiana, and all having been members of said Class A of said Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur or being beneficiaries of persons who were members of said Class A at the time of the commencement, prosecution and final decree in said cause of Balme and Others v. Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur and Others, commenced actions in the circuit court of Montgomery county, \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 362]\n\u00a0\n Ind., and in the circuit court of Marion county, Ind., in which they seek to relitigate questions determined in favor of the defendant, Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, in said suit brought by George Balme and others in the United States District Court for the District of Indiana.\n\n'The ancillary bill of complaint filed herein seeks to enjoin the maintenance and prosecution of the actions commenced by said several defendants to the ancillary bill of complaint in the state courts of Indiana, all of which actions were commenced subsequent to the final decree in said cause of Balme and Others v. Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, which final decree was entered and rendered on the 1st day of July, 1915\n\n\n\n'That a copy of said ancillary bill, together with the motion of the defendants thereto to dismiss the same, and the order of dismissal are contained in the judgment roll filed herein, to which reference is made for a more particular description thereof, and that there is attached to said ancillary bill contained in said judgment roll a full copy of all the pleadings and proceedings had in said cause of Balme et al. v. The Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur et al., together with the report and findings of the master and the judgment and decree of the court.\n\n'I dismissed the ancillary bill of complaint on the ground only that members of Class A of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur residing in the state of Indiana could not be bound by representation by complainants in the class suit of Balme et al. v. Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur et al., as the presence of such Indiana members of Class A as plaintiffs would have ousted the jurisdiction of the court in the main suit, such jurisdiction being based only on diversity of citizenship and not on any federal question, and that therefore the decree in the main case was and is not res adjudicata as to Indiana members of Class A of the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur. \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 363]\n\u00a0\n 'The only question which arose on the dismissal of the ancillary bill of complaint was the question of jurisdiction, and such question of jurisdiction only, as above stated, is hereby certified to the Supreme Court of the United States for its decision thereon.'\n\n From this statement of the case it is apparent that two points are involved in determining the jurisdictional question before us: First. Was the original decree binding upon citizens of Indiana who were in the class for whom the suit was prosecuted, but not otherwise parties to the bill? Second. Was the present suit ancillary in character, and such as to justify an injunction in the federal court to restrain the proceedings in the state court?\n Class suits have long been recognized in federal jurisprudence. In the leading case of Smith et al. v. Swormstedt et al., 16 How. 288, 302 ( 14 L. Ed. 942) of such suits this court said:\n'Where the parties interested in the suit are numerous, their rights and liabilities are so subject to change and fluctuation by death or otherwise, that it would not be possible, without very great inconvenience, to make all of them parties, and would oftentimes prevent the prosecution of the suit to a hearing. For convenience, therefore, and to prevent a failure of justice, a court of equity permits a portion of the parties in interest to represent the entire body, and the decree binds all of them the same as if all were before the court. The legal and equitable rights and liabilities of all being before the court by representation, and especially where the subject-matter of the suit is common to all, there can be very little danger but that the interest of all will be properly protected and maintained.'\n\n The subject is provided for by rule 38 (33 Sup. Ct. xxix) of the equity rules of this court promulgated in 1912, which reads:\n'When the question is one of common or general interest to many persons constituting a class so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court, \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 364]\n\u00a0\n one or more may sue or defend for the whole.'\n\n As the rule formerly read, it contained the following provision:\n'But in such cases the decree shall be without prejudice to the rights and claims of the absent parties.'\n\n The District Court held that this change in the rule could not affect the jurisdictional authority of the court, and added that in its view rule 39 (33 Sup. Ct. xxix) was the applicable one. Rule 39 provides:\n'In all cases where it shall appear to the court that persons, who might otherwise be deemed proper parties to the suit, cannot be made parties by reason of their being out of the jurisdiction of the court, or incapable otherwise of being made parties, or because their joinder would oust the jurisdiction of the court as to the parties before the court, the court may, in its discretion, proceed in the cause without making such persons parties; and in such case the decree shall be without prejudice to the rights of the absent parties.'\n\n Under the latter rule the District Court held that the Indiana citizens were out of the jurisdiction of the federal court in the original suit, and that their joinder would have ousted the jurisdiction of the court, although that fact would not prevent the court from proceeding in the case to a decree without prejudice to their rights. 'In other words,' said the judge, 'although the original bill was a class suit, the class did not include Indiana citizens.'\n That the persons in Class A of the society were so numerous that it would have been impossible to bring them all before the court is apparent from a statement of the case. They numbered many thousands of persons, and resided in many different states of the Union. There was the requisite diversity of citizenship to justify the bringing of a class suit in the United States District Court for the District of Indiana. The court, therefore, properly acquired jurisdiction of the suit, and was authorized to proceed to a final decree.\n The District Court held that in its view joinder of Indiana \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 365]\n\u00a0\n citizens would have defeated jurisdiction in the federal court, which conclusion was necessarily decisive of the case.\n In Stewart v. Dunham, \n115 U.S. 61\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1163, a creditor's bill was filed in equity to set aside a conveyance of a stock of merchandise. The suit was removed from the state court to the Circuit Court of the United States on the ground of diversity of citizenship. After the cause was removed co-claimants, citizens of the same state as were the defendants, were admitted into the suit. This, it was contended, prevented the court from proceeding to a decree, as it was without jurisdiction because the controversy became one not wholly between citizens of different states. Of this contention this court said (\n115 U.S. 64\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1164):\n'This, of course, could have furnished no objection to the removal of the cause from the state court, because at the time these parties had not been admitted to the cause; and their introduction afterwards as co-complainants did not oust the jurisdiction of the court, already lawfully acquired, as between the original parties. The right of the court to proceed to decree between the appellants and the new parties did not depend upon difference of citizenship; because, the bill having been filed by the original complainants on behalf of themselves and all other creditors choosing to come in and share the expenses of the litigation, the court, in exercising jurisdiction between the parties, could incidentally decree in favor of all other creditors coming in under the bill. Such a proceeding would be ancillary to the jurisdiction acquired between the original parties, and it would be merely a matter of form whether the new parties should come in as cocomplainants, or before a master, under a decree ordering a reference to prove the claims of all persons entitled to the benefit of the decree. If the latter course had been adopted, no question of jurisdiction could have arisen. The adoption of the alternative is, in substance, the same thing.'\n\n This principle controls this case. The original suit was \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 366]\n\u00a0\n a class suit brought by a large number of the class as representatives of all its membership.\n The change in rule 38 by the omission of the qualifying clause is significant. It is true that jurisdiction, not warranted by the Constitution and laws of the United States, cannot be conferred by a rule of court, but class suits were known before the adoption of our judicial system, and were in use in English chancery. Street's Federal Equity Practice, vol. 1,  549.\n The District Courts of the United States are courts of equity jurisdiction, with equity powers as broad as those of state courts. That a class suit of this nature might have been maintained in a state court, and would have been binding on all of the class, we can have no doubt. Hartford Insurance Co. v. Ibs, \n237 \nU.S. 662, 672\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 692, L. R. A. 1916A, 765; Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 U.S. 531\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771.\n Owing to the number of interested parties and the impossibility of bringing them all before the court, the original suit was peculiarly one which could only be prosecuted by a part of those interested suing for all in a representative suit. Diversity of citizenship gave the District Court jurisdiction. Indiana citizens were of the class represented, their rights were duly represented by those before the court. The intervention of the Indiana citizens in the suit would not have defeated the jurisdiction already acquired. Stewart v. Dunham, supra. Being thus represented, we think it must necessarily follow that their rights were concluded by the original decree.\n Rule 38, as amended, was intended to apply to just such cases. Rule 39 does not apply to a subject already specifically covered in rule 38. Of course, mere considerations of inconvenience cannot confer jurisdiction, but it is to be noted that if the Indiana citizens are not concluded by the decree, and all others in the class are, this unfortunate situation may result in the determination of the rights of most of the class by a decree rendered upon a theory which \n\n[255 U.S. 356, 367]\n\u00a0\n may be repudiated in another forum as to a part of the same class.\n If the federal courts are to have the jurisdiction in class suits to which they are obviously entitled, the decree when rendered must bind all of the class properly represented. The parties and the subject-matter are within the court's jurisdiction. It is impossible to name all of the class as parties, where, as here, its membership is too numerous to bring into court. The subject-matter included the control and disposition of the funds of a beneficial organization, and was properly cognizable in a court of equity. The parties bringing the suit truly represented the interested class. If the decree is to be effective and conflicting judgments are to be avoided, all of the class must be concluded by the decree.\n As to the other question herein involved, holding, as we do, that the membership of Class A were concluded by the decree of the District Court, an ancillary bill may be prosecuted from the same court to protect the rights secured to all in the class by the decree rendered. Looney v. East Texas R. R. Co., \n247 U.S. 214\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 460, and cases cited.\n It follows that the decree of the District Court, dismissing the ancillary bill for want of jurisdiction, must be reversed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUTTON v.

U S \n256 U.S. 575\n (1921) ] \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 577]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The River and Harbor Act of July 25, 1912, c. 253, 37 Stat. 201, 209, made this appropriation:\n'Improving channel from Clearwater Harbor through Boca Ceiga Bay to Tampa Bay, Florida. Completing improvement and for maintenance, twenty thousand dollars.'\n\n Sealed proposals were solicited, and on January 21, 1913, a contract was made by the War Department with the Hillsboro Dredging Company to do work at unit rates for dredging soft material and for excavating rock. The appropriation was ample to defray the cost at these rates, assuming that the quantities of material to be removed did not greatly exceed the estimates presented by the specifications. It was provided by the contract that United States 'inspectors will keep a record of the work done' and also that, 'within the limits of available funds the United States reserves the right to require the removal of such yardage as will complete the work, ... be it more or less than the quantities above estimated . ...'\n Work was begun under the contract in June, 1913, and payments were made monthly on estimates of the government inspector. Upon these estimates both the government and the contractor relied. About May 15, 1914, it was discovered that through a mistake of the inspector so much work had already been done that, if paid for at the unit rates, it would call for an amount far in excess of the appropriation available. The government engineer in charge ordered operations discontinued immediately, and this contractor had no further connection with the work. The work already done amounted at the unit price to $25,032.31. The aggregate appropriation available for the improvement-including an additional $3,000 made by Act of March 4, 1913, c. 144, 37 Stat. 801, 809-was $23,000. Against this appropriation the government \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 578]\n\u00a0\n charged $1,732.90 for superintendence and office expenses. The balance-$21, 267.10-it paid to the contractor, leaving unsatisfied a claim, at the unit rates, of $3,042.74, for material dredged or excavated, and as further claim of $1,551 for the cost of blasting rock which was not removed because of the order to cease work. To recover these sums the assignee in bankruptcy of the Hillsboro Company brought this suit in the Court of Claims. That court entered judgment for the government, 55 Ct. Cl. 193; and the case is here on appeal.\n First. It is urged that the Secretary of War was authorized by Congress to make, and that he did make, a contract with the Hillsboro Company not only to proceed with the work, but for its completion, and that the United States is, therefore, liable, even though the appropriation proved to be insufficient. Two appropriations had been made for this project before the Act of 1912 above referred to; one by Act of June 25, 1910, c. 382, 36 Stat. 630, 644, of $29,500, for 'improving channel from Clearwater Harbor'; the other by Act of February 27, 1911, c. 166, 36 Stat. 933, 941, of a like amount for 'completing improvement.' The Act of 1912 provided by section 8 (37 Stat. 233; Comp. St.  9888) that--\n'Whenever the appropriations made, or authorized to be made, for the completion of any river and harbor work shall prove insufficient therefor, the Secretary of War may, in his discretion, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, apply the funds so appropriated or authorized to the prosecution of such work.'\n\n But by none of these acts was any authority conferred upon the Secretary of War to complete the improvement or to contract to expend more than the amount then appropriated. On the other hand, section 3733 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6886) provides that no contract 'for any public improvement shall bind the government to pay a larger sum than the amount in the treasury appropriated for the specific purpose.' See \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 579]\n\u00a0\n also sections 3732 and 5503 (Comp. St.  6884, 10266). And the Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3914, provides by section 9 (34 Stat. 697, 764; Comp. St .  6763) that--\n'No act of Congress hereafter passed shall be construed ... to authorize the execution of a contract involving the payment of money in excess of appropriations made by law, unless such act shall in specific terms declare an appropriation to be made or that a contract may be executed.'\n\n The Secretary of War was, therefore, without power to make a contract binding the government to pay more than the amount appropriated. See Bradley v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 104, 113\n, 114 S.. Those dealing with him must be held to have had notice of the limitations upon his authority. But there is nothing in the contract indicating a purpose to bind the government for any amount in excess of the appropriation. On the contrary, it limits to the amount of the appropriation the work which may be done.\n By Act of October 2, 1914, c. 313, 38 Stat. 725, Congress appropriated the sum of $20,000,000--\n'to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of War and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers, for the preservation and maintenance of existing river and harbor works, and for the prosecution of such projects heretofore authorized as may be most desirable in the interests of commerce and navigation, and most economical and advantageous in the execution of the work.'\n\n Out of the sum so appropriated $12,000 was allotted by the Secretary for completing the Clearwater Harbor improvement; and out of this sum there was paid to the contractor in November, 1914, $3,046.44, being the unpaid balance at unit prices for the material removed prior to May 15, 1914. This payment was later disallowed by the Comptroller of the War Department and the Comptroller of the Treasury, and was deducted from payments made to the contractor under a wholly different contract for work in North and South Carolina. It is clear that the Act of 1914 did not \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 580]\n\u00a0\n authorize the application of any part of the appropriation to work theretofore done. The payment therefrom having been unauthorized, did not bind the government; and if it was entitled to recover the money, the method pursued in doing so was proper. Wisconsin Central Railroad Co. v. United States, \n164 U.S. 190\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 45; Grand Trunk Western Railway Co. v. United States, \n252 U.S. 112\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 309.\n Second. It is contended that since the contract provided that the government 'inspectors will keep a record of the work done,' since their estimates were relied upon by the contractor, and since by reason of the inspector's mistake the contractor was led to do work in excess of the appropriation, the United States is liable as upon an implied contract for the fair value of the work performed. But the short answer to this contention is that since no official of the government could have rendered it liable for this work by an express contract, none can by his acts or omissions create a valid contract implied in fact. The limitation upon the authority to impose contract obligations upon the United States is as applicable to contracts by implication as it is to those expressly made. Nor did the subsequent use of the excavation by the government imply a promise to pay for it if at any time thereafter Congress should appropriate money to be applied in completing the improvement.\n'Whenever a structure is permanently affixed to real property belonging to an individual, without his consent or request, he cannot be held responsible because of its subsequent use. It becomes his by being annexed to the soil; and he is not obliged to remove it to escape liability. He is not deemed to have accepted it so as to incur an obligation to pay for it, merely because he has not chosen to tear it down, but has seen fit to use it.' United States v. Pacific Railroad, \n120 \nU.S. 227, 240\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 490, 496 (30 L. Ed. 634).\n\n And the work here in question was not done with the consent or at the request of the United States; for neither the government inspectors \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 581]\n\u00a0\n nor the Secretary of War had authority either to obligate the government or accept voluntary services. See Rev. Stat.  3679, as amended by Act March 3, 1905, c. 1484,  4, 33 Stat. 1257, and Act February 27, 1906, c. 510,  3, 34 Stat. 48 (Comp. St.  6778).\n There is no necessity to consider what may be the equitable rule where there is a claim of unjust enrichment through work done upon the land of another under a mistake of fact. See Bright v. Boyd, 1 Story, 478, Fed. Cas. No. 1,875; Id., 2 Story, 608, Fed. Cas. No. 1,876; Williams v. Gibbes, 20 How. 535, 538; Canal Bank v. Hudson, \n111 U.S. 66\n, 82-83, 4 Sup. Ct. 303; Armstrong v. Ashley, \n204 \nU.S. 272, 285\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 270. Nor need we consider whether the doctrine is ever applicable to transactions with the government. For the right to sue the United States in the Court of Claims here invoked must rest upon the existence of a contract express or implied in fact. United States v. North American Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 518.\n Third. While the contractor cannot recover for work done in excess of the appropriation he is entitled to payment to the extent of the available appropriation. The amount appropriated was $23,000. The contractor received only $21,267.10. It appears that the balance, $1,732.90, was applied to superintendence and office expenses; and the findings of fact state that the contractor 'was charged with expenses of inspection during an extension of time beyond the contract period amounting to $722.47.' The appropriate expense of superintendence is clearly chargeable against the appropriation. But if, through mistake of the government's representatives more work is done, and work is continued for a longer period, than was contracted for or authorized, the expenses of superintendence incident to the mistake should be borne by the government, and the contractor should not be made to suffer by the depletion of the appropriation. The fund otherwise available for work actually performed should be applied to that purpose. \n\n[256 U.S. 575, 582]\n\u00a0\n The findings of fact leave us in doubt whether there has been charged against this appropriation any sum for superintendence in excess of amounts properly chargeable; and counsel were unable to remove these doubts, to which attention was called at the argument. Unless the parties can agree as to the facts, the case should be remanded to the Court of Claims to determine what, if any, amount was erroneously charged against the appropriations aggregating $23,000; and for the amount of such improper charges, if any, judgment should be entered for the petitioner. Except as stated the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEDROW v. A T LEWIS & SON DRY GOODS CO(1921)\nNo. 357\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n Messrs.

HOGARTH SHIPPING CORPORATION(1921)\nNo. 555\nArgued: Decided: June 6, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 619, 620]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Griffin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John M. Woolsey, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in admiralty to recover damages for an alleged breach of a voyage charter party entered into in New York, February 6, 1915, between a British corporation, which owned the Baron Ogilvy and other freight ships, and a Texas corporation, which was engaged in shipping and marketing petroleum products. The charter party did not name a particular ship as the subject of the hiring, but required that one of a certain type be designated from among the ships of the British company, on or before March 15. In due time that company named the Baron Ogilvy, and the Texas Company assented. The intended voyage was from a port in Texas to another in South Africa with a full cargo of refined petroleum in cases. The ship was to be tendered at the initial port ready to load between April 15 and May 15, 1915, and in case of \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n default the Texas Company was given the option of canceling or maintaining the charter party. If the vessel was then at that port, the option was to be exercised at once, and if she was not then there, it was to be exercised within 24 hours after her arrival. There was no clause expressly excepting restraints of princes, etc. April 10, 1915, the Baron Ogilvy, while in British waters and being provisioned for the intended voyage, was requisitioned by the British government and pressed into its war service, in which she continuously was retained until October 20 following. On April 12 the British company notified the Texas Company that the vessel had been requisitioned and therefore would not be available to carry out the charter party. The Texas Company thereupon procured another vessel to make the voyage at the time intended, but at an increased freight rate, and subsequently brought this suit against the British company on the theory that the latter had broken the charter party and was liable in damages for the difference between the rate which it was to receive and that actually paid to the other vessel. On the final hearing the District Court rendered a decree for the respondent, the principal grounds of the decision being (a) that when in accordance with the terms of the charter party the Baron Ogilvy was named as the ship to make the voyage the contract became an ordinary voyage charter party for that ship, and none other, and (b) that that ship, before the time for the voyage, was taken in invitum by the owner's government for war use for a period likely to extend beyond the time for the intended voyage, and that this dissolved the charter party and excused the owner from furnishing the ship. (D. C.) 265 Fed. 375. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 267 Fed. 1023; and a writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n254 U.S. 625\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 15, 65 L. Ed. --.\n We agree that after the designation of the Baron Ogilvy, \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 627]\n\u00a0\n conformably to a provision in the charter party, every element of an ordinary voyage charter party for a particular ship was present. It was then as if that vessel had been named at the outset. And, as there was no provision for substituting another ship, there was no obligation on the part of the owner to furnish, nor on the part of the charterer to accept, another. Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton, Edbridge & Co., \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 1901]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 126, 131. The contract related to a particular ship just as it related to a particular voyage. Neither could be changed without departing from the contract, which could not be done without the consent of both parties.\n The libelant challenges the good faith of the owner and seeks by taking mere fragments of the evidence here and there to show that the owner invited the requisition, welcomed it as promising a better return than the charter party, and in effect voluntarily turned the vessel over to the government. But the fragments to which attention is invited must be read with the context and all the evidence must be considered. When this is done it becomes very plain that there is no basis for the challenge. The owner made the usual preparations for complying with the charter party, earnestly sought to prevent the requisitioning of the vessel, urged the existence of the charter party as a reason for leaving her free, and respected the requisition, when made, because no other course was reasonably open. It may not be material, but in fact the charter party gave promise of a better return and called for a service which would be less hazardous. The vessel was taken by the government for the use to which she was subjected and after the taking the owner agreed to furnish certain additional facilities by reason of which a higher compensation was obtained than otherwise would have been allowed. Beyond this the owner was accorded no voice in the matter.\n As the ship was British and in British waters and the \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 628]\n\u00a0\n owner was a British corporation the power of the British government to requisition the ship is beyond question. But the libelant insists that those who assumed to exert this power did not proceed in the mode prescribed, and therefore that the requisition was invalid. The facts adequately proved are as follows: A royal proclamation of August 3, 1914, authorized and empowered the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, 'by warrant under the hand of their Secretary,' 'to requisition and take up' British vessels within British waters for use as transports and auxiliaries. The Baron Ogilvy was requisitioned by an order of the Lords Commissioners, and the order was communicated to the owner by a telegram signed 'Transports' and saying: 'SS. Baron Ogilvy is requisitioned under royal proclamation for government service.' The telegram was sent by the Assistant Director of Military Sea Transports, the officer through whom requisitioning orders were executed. This was the usual mode of communicating such orders. Formal warrants never were issued. Generally, the telegraphic communication was followed, after a time, by a letter of like import bearing a block (printed) signature of the Secretary; but in this instance, through an error in office routine, no letter was sent. These letters were intended to be corroborative, but were not deemed essential; and in actual practice the Lords Commissioners and those who executed their orders proceeded on the theory that the ship was taken when the order was received by the owner, however the order was communicated, and that a telegraphic communication of it was effective and must be obeyed. Indeed, the evidence is that if the telegraphic order was not obeyed the vessel would be taken by force. The owner here-six of whose ships had been requisitioned theretofore-so understood the practice and respected the order. It does not appear that the government at any time or in any way disapproved of the practice, but it does appear that in \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 629]\n\u00a0\n this instance the government treated the telegraphic order as effective by using the ship as a transport for more than six months and compensating the owner accordingly. In these circumstances, the contention that the requisition was invalid is quite untenable. Whether in differenct circumstances it could and should be pronounced invalid here we need not consider. See Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 U.S. 250\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 53; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; Oetjen v.

American Trading Co., \n195 U.S. 439\n, 467-468, 25 Sup. Ct. 84.\n In the District Court the British Ambassador was permitted to intervene as amicus curiae, object to the adjudication of the libelant's claim and present a certificate avowing that the requisition was a governmental act. Complaint is made of this. The permission was improvidently granted, as was afterwards indicated by this court in other cases. In re Muir, \n254 U.S. 522\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed.--; The Pesaro, \n255 U.S. 216\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 308. But the libelant was not prejudiced, for the intervention and certificate ultimately were not considered and the decree was rested on the evidence otherwise presented.\n Finally, the libelant insists that the requisition, even if valid and not invited by the owner, did not operate to dissolve the charter party or to excuse the owner from performing it. The courts below held otherwise, and we think rightly so.\n It long has been settled in the English courts and in those of this country, federal and state, that where parties enter into a contract on the assumption that some particular thing essential to its performance will continue to exist and be available for the purpose and neither agrees to be responsible for its continued existence and availability the contract must be regarded as subject to an implied condition that, if before the time for performance \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 630]\n\u00a0\n and without the default of either party the particular thing ceases to exist or be available for the purpose, the contract shall be dissolved and the parties excused from performing it.

Siegel, Cooper & Co., 237 Ill. 610, 86 N. E. 1104, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1114. The principle underlying the rule is widely recognized and applied to various classes of contracts. The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, \n244 U.S. 12\n, 22-24, 37 Sup. Ct. 490. But, of course, it does not apply where the risk is fully covered by a term of the contract, nor where performance is not practically cut off, but only rendered more difficult or costly. Columbus Railway, Power & Light Co. v. Columbus, \n249 U.S. 399\n, 410 et seq., 39 Sup. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648. Perhaps the oldest and most familiar application of the principle is to contracts for personal service, where performance is prevented by death or illness. Robinson v. Davison (1871) L. R. 6 Exch. 269; Spalding v. Rosa, 71 N. Y. 40, 27 Am. Rep. 7. Another application widely recognized is where a ship chartered for a voyage, after the date of the charter party and before the time for the voyage, is accidentally destroyed by fire, lost at sea, or injured in such degree as not to be available for the service. The Tornado, supra, was a suit on a contract of affreightment where the ship, before beginning the voyage, was accidentally burned and thereby prevented from undertaking it. This court held that the contract was dissolved, saying (\n108 U.S. 349\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 750):\n'We are of opinion that by the disaster which occurred before the ship had broken ground or commenced to earn freight, the circumstances with reference to which the \n\n[256 U.S. 619, 631]\n\u00a0\n contract of affreightment was entered into were so altered by the supervening of occurrences which it cannot be intended were within the contemplation of the parties in entering into the contract, that the shipper and the underwriters were absolved from all liability under the contract of affreightment. The contract had reference to a particular ship, to be inexistence existence as a seaworthy vessel and capable of carrying cargo and earning freight and of entering on the voyage. All the fundamental conditions forming part of the contract of the shipowner were wanting at the time when the earning of freight could commence.'\n\n Here the ship, although still in existence and entirely seaworthy, was rendered unavailable for the performance of the charter party by the requisition. By that supervening act she was impressed into the war service of the British government for a period likely to extend-and which as it turned out did extend-long beyond the time for the charter voyage. In other words, compliance with the charter party was made impossible by an act of state, the charterer was prevented from having the service of the ship and the owner from earning the stipulated freight. The event apparently was not anticipated, and there was no provision casting the risk on either party. Both assumed that the ship would remain available, and that was the basis of their mutual engagements. These, we think, must be regarded as entered into on an implied condition that, if before the time for the voyage the ship was rendered unavailable by such a supervening act as the requisition, the contract should be at an end and the parties absolved from liability under it.\n That the charter party was entered into in this country is not material. The important consideration is that it became impossible of performance through a supervening act of state which operated directly on the ship and the parties could not avoid.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE CARLO POMA(1921)\nNo. 167\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

The only difference requiring notice is that the appeal in that case was to this court while in this it was to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which rendered a decree of affirmance. 259 Fed. 369, 179 C. C. A. 345. A writ of certiorari brings that decree here for review. Cavallaro v. Carlo Poma, \n250 U.S. 656\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 14\n\n\n The question raised and decided in the District Court was whether, sitting as a court of admiralty, it could entertain a suit in rem against a ship such as the Carlo Poma was represented to be in the suggestion of the Italian Ambassador. That was a jurisdictional question in the sense of section 238 of the Judicial Code. The Pesaro, supra. The court resolved it in the negative and accordingly released the ship from arrest, thereby disposing of the suit adversely to the libelant.\n From that decree an appeal did not lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals, but only to this court. Such is the effect of the statute, Judicial Code,  128, 238 (Comp. St.  1120, 1215), defining and regulating the appellate jurisdiction of this court and of the Circuit Courts of Appeals, as is pointed out in United \n\n[255 U.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n States v. Jahn, \n155 \nU.S. 109, 114\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 39. In that case, after an extended review of the statute, it was said:\n'If the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court [now District Court] is in issue and decided in favor of the defendant, as that disposes of the case, the plaintiff should have the question certified and take his appeal or writ of error directly to this court.'\n\n As therefore the decree in the District Court was not open to review by the Circuit Court of Appeals, we must vacate the latter's decision and remand the case to it with a direction to dismiss the appeal. See Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, \n189 \nU.S. 71, 73\n, 74 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 604; Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, \n240 \nU.S. 305, 318\n, 36 S. Sup.

Conlen, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Howard M. Long, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Consequent on the allowance of a writ of certiorari, the case is here to review the action of the court below in granting, in an admiralty case there pending, a motion for leave to withdraw an appeal made by the respondents, who were there appellants. 256 Fed. 224, 167 C. C. A. 440. The situation thus arose: The schooner John Twohy was chartered to carry a cargo of bones from Buenos Aires to Philadelphia. The voyage was made, and, following the discharge of the cargo, the charterers, who are the petitioners, \n\n[255 U.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n libeled the vessel, asserting claims (1) for failure to deliver part of the cargo which, as evidenced by the intake weights recited in the bill of lading, had been loaded on the vessel at Buenos Aires; and (2) for damage by sea water to part of the delivered cargo in consequence of leakage alleged to be due to the unseaworthiness of the vessel.\n Holding that the recital in the bill of lading of the intake weights was but prima facie evidence, and that the proof showed the delivery of all cargo received on board, the court dismissed the libel as to the first claim. As to the second, however, it found that the damage from leakage had resulted from unseaworthiness, and sustained that claim.\n The claimants alone appealed, and, after having twice obtained a continuance, moved for leave to withdraw the appeal. Opposing this notion, the libelants asserted that under the practice in admiralty in that circuit an appeal opened up the whole case for reconsideration in the appellate court; that, relying upon that practice, they had refrained from themselves taking an appeal from the ruling of the trial court denying their claim for nondelivery of cargo; that, owing to the continuances allowed the appellants, the time within which the libelants might have taken an appeal had expired, and if the appellants prevailed in their motion the libelants would be without means of obtaining a review of the adverse action of the trial court.\n Coming to consider these contentions, the court held them to be without merit, first, because the libelants, by themselves taking an appeal, could have required the appellate court to proceed and decide the same; second, because, having failed to adopt that course they could not complain if the court, in the exercise of its discretion, declined to grant them as a legal right that which they might have made such, had they availed themselves of \n\n[255 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n the appropriate procedure; and, third, because the court conceived that the allowance of the withdrawal of the appeal would be in furtherance of the due administration of the admiralty in that it would tend to put an end to litigation, would afford appellants time within which to exercise a cooler judgment, would forewarn all persons to themselves appeal if they desired to insure a review of unfavorable decisions, and would prevent the hardship which would result from a contrary ruling, as many would be deterred from appealing from unjust decisions if, having once embarked on that course, they were powerless to withdraw. Upon compliance with certain conditions prescribed by the court, appellants' motion was therefore granted.\n We are unable to give our approval to this result or the reasons by which it was sustained. As recognized by the court, the case of The Canadia, 241 Fed. 233, 154 C. C. A. 153, had settled in that circuit that in admiralty an appeal by either party operated to remove the case to the appellate court for a trial de novo. The decision was based solely upon the previous rulings of this court in Irvine v. The Hesper, \n122 U.S. 256\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1177, and Reid v. American Express Co., \n241 U.S. 544\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 712. In Irvine v. The Hesper, Mr. Justice Blatchford, speaking for the court, said:\n'It is well settled, however, that an appeal in admiralty from the District Court to the Circuit Court vacates altogether the decree of the District Court, and that the case is tried de novo in the Circuit Court. Yeaton v. United States, 5 Cranch, 281; Anonymous, 1 Gallison, 22; The Roarer, 1 Blatchford 1; The Saratoga v. 438 Bales of Cotton, 1 Woods, 75; The Lucille, 19 Wall. 73; The Charles Morgan, \n115 U.S. 69\n, 75. We do not think that the fact that the claimants did not appeal from the decree of the District Court alters the rule. When the libelants appealed, they did so in view of the rule, and took the risk of the result of a trial of the case de novo. The whole \n\n[255 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n case was opened by their appeal, as much as it would have been if both parties had appealed, or if the appeal had been taken only by the claimants.'\n\n And in the Reid Case this court, although pressed to repudiate the practice as opposed to the weight of adjudged cases, declined to do so, and reaffirmed the ruling made in Irvine v. The Hesper.\n In view, therefore, of the settled law as to the effect of appeals in admiralty, we are of opinion that the libelants were justified in regarding the appeal taken by the claimants as securing to libelants the right to be heard in the appellate court without the necessity of perfecting a cross-appeal in order to preserve that right. To hold, then, that the appellate court could nevertheless, without affording the libelants an opportunity to be heard, enter a decree the plain effect of which was to deny one of the two claims for which the libel was brought and which, in view of the settled effect of the appeal, the libelants could not be presumed to have abandoned, would be to subject them to a wrong without a remedy, even if it did not amount to a denial of due process of law.\n And this renders it unnecessary to consider the supposed advantages which would arise from the adopting of a new rule, since, if the wisdom of so doing be arguendo conceded, that concession would not justify the misapplication of the existing rule and the destruction of rights vested in reliance, not only upon its existence, but upon the discharge of the duty to enforce and apply it.\n It follows that the decree of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE PESARO(1921)\nNo. 317\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Oscar R. Houston, of New York City, Harold V. Amberg, of Washington, D. C., and Henry J. Bigham, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. John M. Woolsey, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Pesaro, an Italian steamship which carried a shipment of olive oil from Genoa to New York, was sued in rem \n\n[255 U.S. 216, 217]\n\u00a0\n in admiralty in the District Court to enforce a claim for damage to that part of her cargo, the libel alleging that she was 'a general ship engaged in the common carriage of merchandise by water, for hire.' The usual process issued and the ship was arrested. Afterwards upon a direct suggestion by the Italian Ambassador that the ship was owned by the Italian government and at the time of the arrest was in its possession, and therefore was not subject to the court's process, the court vacated the arrest. The libelants objected that a direct suggestion by the Ambassador was not admissible and that, to be entertained, the suggestion should come through official channels of the United States; but the objection was overruled. The libelants then requested permission to traverse the suggestion and to make a showing in opposition; but the request was denied, the court holding that to controvert or question the suggestion was not allowable. The libelants appealed directly to this court, and in that connection the District Court certified the ground of its decisions as follows:\n'I do certify that the vessel was released from arrest by me by a final decree herein, solely because I deemed that the United States District Court, sitting as a court of admiralty, has no jurisdiction to subject to its process a steamship which is by the suggestion of the said Italian Ambassador filed in this court represented to be the public property and in the possession of the kingdom of Italy.'\n\n Our authority to entertain the appeal is challenged upon two grounds. One is that the decree is not final, because it does not dismiss the libel. That it does not formally do so is true, but this is not decisive. The suit is in rem-is against the ship. The decree holds for naught the process under which the ship was arrested, declares she is not subject to any such process and directs her release-in other words, dismisses her without day. Thus the decree ends the suit as effectually as if it formally dismissed the libel. \n\n[255 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, therefore, it is final. That it was intended to be so is shown by the court's certificate.\n The other ground is that the question raised and decided was not a jurisdictional one in the sense of the statute (Jud. Code,  238 [Comp. St .  1215]), providing for an appeal or writ of error from a District Court directly to this court 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court may be in issue.' But we think it was such a question because it directly concerned the power of the District Court, as defined by the laws of the United States, to entertain and determine the suit. The Steamship Jefferson, \n215 \nU.S. 130, 137\n, 138 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 54, 17 Ann. Cas. 907; The Ira M. Hedges, \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235; United States v. Congress Construction Co., \n222 U.S. 199\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 44. By Judicial Code  24, cl. 3, the District Courts are invested with original jurisdiction of 'all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction'; and this is a suit of that character. Whether Congress intended this statute should include suits against ships such as the Pesaro is represented to be in the Ambassador's suggestion, when they are within the waters of the United States, is as yet an open question. The statute contains no express exception of them; but it may be that they are impliedly excepted. The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116, 136, 146. If so, the implication is a part of the statute. United States v. Babbit, 1 Black, 55, 61; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 451\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737. Thus the answer to the question propounded to the District Court involved a construction of the statute defining its jurisdiction in admiralty.\n We come then to consider whether the court erred in sustaining the Ambassador's suggestion that the ship was not subject to its process. Apart from that suggestion, there was nothing pointing to an absence of jurisdiction. On the contrary, what was said in the libel pointed plainly to its presence. The suggestion was made directly to the court and not through any official channel of the United States. True, it was accompanied by a certificate of the \n\n[255 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of State stating that the Ambassador was the duly accredited diplomatic representative of Italy, but while that established his diplomatic status it gave no sanction to the suggestion. The terms and form of the suggestion show that the Ambassador did not intend thereby to put himself or the Italian government in the attitude of a suitor, but only to present a respectful suggestion and invite the court to give effect to it. He called it a 'suggestion,' and we think it was nothing more. In these circumstances the libelants' objection that, to be entertained, the suggestion should come through official channels of the United States was well taken. In re Muir, Master of the Gleneden, 41 Sup. Ct. 185. And see United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 209\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 240. With the suggestion eliminated, as it should have been, there obviously was no basis for holding that the ship was not subject to the court's process. What the decree should have been if the matters affirmed in the suggestion had been brought to the court's attention and established in an appropriate way we have no occasion to consider now. An opportunity so to present and establish them should be accorded when the case goes back, as it must.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRUAX v. CORRIGAN(1921)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clifton Mathews, of Globe, Ariz., and E. E. Ellinwood and John Mason Ross, both of Bisbee, Ariz., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jackson H. Ralston, of Washington, D. C., Wiley E. Jones, of Phoenix, Ariz., and Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[257 U.S. 312, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs in error, who were plaintiffs below, and will be so called, own, maintain and operate, on Main street, in the city of Bisbee, Ariz., a restaurant, known as the 'English Kitchen.' The defendants are cooks and waiters formerly in the employ of the plaintiffs, together with the labor union and the trades assembly of which \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n they were members. All parties are residents of the state of Arizona.\n The complaint set out the following case:\n In April, 1916, a dispute arose between the plaintiffs and the defendants' union concerning the terms and conditions of employment of the members of the union. The plaintiffs refused to yield to the terms of the union, which thereupon ordered a strike of those of its members who were in plaintiffs' employ. To win the strike, and to coerce and compel the plaintiffs to comply with the demands of the union, the defendants and others unknown to the plaintiffs entered into a conspiracy and boycott to injure plaintiffs in their restaurant and restaurant business, by inducing plaintiffs' customers and others, theretofore well and favorably disposed, to cease to patronize or trade with the plaintiffs. The method of inducing was set out at length, and included picketing, displaying banners, advertising the strike, denouncing plaintiffs as 'unfair' to the union, and appealing to customers to stay away from the 'English Kitchen,' and the circulation of handbills containing abusive and libelous charges against plaintiffs, their employees, and their patrons, and intimations of injury to future patrons. Copies of the handbills were set forth in exhibits made part of the complaint.\n In consequence of defendants' acts, many customers were induced to cease from patronizing plaintiffs, and their daily receipts, which had been in excess of the sum of $156 were reduced to $75. The complaint averred that if the acts were continued, the business would be entirely destroyed, and that the plaintiffs would suffer great and irreparable injury; that for the plaintiffs to seek to recover damages would involve a multiplicity of suits; that all the defendants were insolvent, and would be unable to respond in damages for any injury resulting from their acts, and the plaintiffs were therefore without any adequate remedy at law. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 322]\n\u00a0\n The complaint further averred that the defendants were relying for immunity on paragraph 1464 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913 (Civ. Code), which is in part as follows:\n'No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of this state, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving or growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property or to a property right of the party making the application, for which unjury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney.\n\n'And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at or near a house or place where any person resides or works, or carries on business, or happens to be for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person, to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute; or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do. ...'\n\n The plaintiffs alleged that this paragraph, if it made lawful defendants' acts, contravened the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by depriving plaintiffs of their property without due process of law, and by denying to plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws, and was therefore void and of no effect. Upon the case thus stated the plaintiffs asked a temporary and a permanent injunction. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 323]\n\u00a0\n The defendants filed a demurrer, on two grounds: First, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that the property rights asserted therein were not, under paragraph 1464, Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913, of such character that their irreparable injury might be enjoined; and, secondly, that upon its face the complaint showed a want of equity.\n The superior court for Cochise county sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint, and this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arizona.\n The ruling of the Supreme Court proceeded, first, on the assumption that the gravamen of the complaint was that the defendants were merely inducing patrons to cease their patronage by making public the fact of the dispute and the attitude of plaintiffs in it; and secondly, on the proposition that, while good will is a valuable factor in business success, 'no man has a vested right in the esteem of the public'-that, while the plaintiff had a clear right to refuse the demand of the union, the union had a right to advertise the cause of the strike. The court held that the purpose of paragraph 1464 was to recognize the right of workmen on a strike to use peaceable means to accomplish the lawful ends for which the strike was called; that picketing, if peaceably carried on for a lawful purpose, was no violation of the rights of the person whose place of business was picketed; that prior to the enactment of paragraph 1464, picketing was unlawful in Arizona, because it was presumed to induce breaches of the peace, but that plaintiffs had no vested right to have such a rule of law continue in that state; that under paragraph 1464 picketing was no longer conclusively presumed to be unlawful; that the paragraph simply dealt with a rule of evidence requiring the courts to substitute evidence of the nature of the act for the presumption otherwise arising; that the plaintiffs' property rights were not invaded by picketing, unless the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 324]\n\u00a0\n picketing interfered with the free conduct of the business; that plaintiffs did not claim that defendants had by violent means invaded their rights; and that, if that kind of picketing were charged and established by proof, plaintiffs would be entitled to relief to the extent of prohibiting violence in any from.\n The effect of this ruling is that, under the statute, loss may be inflicted upon the plaintiffs' property and business by 'picketing' in any form if violence be not used, and that because no violence was shown or claimed, the campaign carried on, as described in the complaint and exhibits, did not unlawfully invade complainants' rights.\n The facts alleged are admitted by the demurrer, and, in determining their legal effect as a deprivation of plaintiffs' legal rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, we are at as full liberty to consider them as was the state Supreme Court. McKay v. Dillon, 4 How. 431; Dower v. Richards, \n151 \nU.S. 658, 667\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 452. Nor does the court's declaration that the statute is a rule of evidence bind us in such an investigation. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 239 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 145; Chicago Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 U.S. 418\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 702; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 273; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427, 432\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 325. In cases brought to this court from state courts for review, on the ground that a federal right set up in the state court has been wrongly denied, and in which the state court has put its decision on a finding that the asserted federal right has no basis in point of fact, or has been waived or lost, this court, as an incident of its power to determine whether a federal right has been wrongly denied, may go behind the finding to see whether it is without substantial support. If the rule were otherwise, it almost always would be within the power of a state court practically to prevent a review here. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., \n223 \nU.S. 573, 591\n, 593 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 316; Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 U.S. 655\n, 688, \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 325]\n\u00a0\n 669, 32 Sup. Ct. 389; Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 901. Another class of cases in which this court will review the finding of the court as to the facts is when the conclusion of law and findings of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the question to analyze the facts. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; Jones National Bank v. Yates, \n240 \nU.S. 541, 552\n, 553 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 429. In view of these decisions and the grounds upon which they proceed, it is clear that in a case like the present, where the issue is whether a state statute in its application to facts which are set out in detail in the pleadings and are admitted by demurrer violates the federal Constitution, this court must analyze the facts as averred and draw its own inferences as to their ultimate effect, and is not bound by the conclusion of the state Supreme Court in this regard. The only respect in such a case in which this court is bound by the judgment of the state Supreme Court is in the construction which that court puts upon the statute.\n The complaint and its exhibits make this case:\n The defendants conspired to injure and destroy plaintiffs' business by inducing their theretofore willing patrons and would-be patrons not to patronize them, and they influenced these to withdraw or withhold their patronage:\n\n\n (1)\n By having the agents of the union walk forward and back constantly during all the business hours in front of plaintiffs' restaurant, and within five feet thereof, displaying a banner announcing in large letters that the restaurant was unfair to cooks and waiters and their union.\n\n\n (2)\n By having agents attend at or near the entrance of the restaurant during all business hours and continuously announce in a loud voice, audible for a great distance, that the restaurant was unfair to the labor union.\n\n\n (3)\n By characterizing the employees of the plaintiff as scab Mexican labor, and using opprobrious epithets concerning \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 326]\n\u00a0\n them in handbills continuously distributed in front of the restaurant to would-be customers.\n\n\n (4)\n By applying in such handbills abusive epithets to Truax, the senior member of plaintiffs' firm, and making libelous charges against him, to the effect that he was tyrannical with his help, and chased them down the street with a butcher knife; that he broke his contract and repudiated his pledged word; that he had made attempts to force cooks and waiters to return to work by attacks on men and women; that a friend of Truax assaulted a woman and pleaded guilty; that plaintiff was known by his friends, and that Truax's treatment of his employees was explained by his friend's assault; that he was a 'bad actor.'\n\n\n (5)\n By seeking to disparage plaintiffs' resturant, charging that the prices were higher and the food worse than in any other restaurant, and that assaults and slugging were a regular part of the bill of fare, with police indifferent.\n\n\n (6)\n By attacking the character of those who did patronize, saying that their mental caliber and moral fiber fell far below the American average, and inquiring of the would-be patrons: Can you patronize such a place and look the world in the face?\n\n\n (7)\n By threats of similar injury to the would-be patrons-by such expressions as 'All ye who enter here leave all hope behind;' 'Don't be a traitor to humanity;' by offering a reward for any of the ex- members of the union caught eating in the restaurant; by saying in the handbills: 'We are also aware that handbills and banners in front of a business house on the Main street give the town a bad name, but they are permanent institutions until William Truax agrees to the eight hour day.'\n\n\n (8)\n By warning any person wishing to purchase the business from the Truax firm that a donation would be necessary, amount to be fixed by the District Trades As \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 327]\n\u00a0\n sembly, before the picketing and boycotting would be given up.\n The result of this campaign was to reduce the business of the plaintiffs from more than $55,000 a year to one of $12,000.\n Plaintiffs' business is a property right (Duplex Printing Press. Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 465\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172), and free access for employees, owner, and customers to his place of business is incident to such right. Intentional injury caused to either right or both by a conspiracy is a tort. Concert of action is a conspiracy, if its object is unlawful or if the means used are unlawful. Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 542; Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, supra. Intention to inflict the loss and the actual loss caused are clear. The real question here is: Were the means used illegal? The above recital of what the defendants did can leave no doubt of that. The libelous attacks upon the plaintiffs, their business, their employees, and their customers, and the abusive epithets applied to them, were palpable wrongs. They were uttered in aid of the plan to induce plaintiffs' customers and would-be customers to refrain from patronizing the plaintiffs. The patrolling of defendants immediately in front of the restaurant on the main street and within five feet of plaintiffs' premises continuously during business hours, with the banners announcing plaintiffs' unfairness; the attendance by the picketers at the entrance to the restaurant and their insistent and loud appeals all day long, the constant circulation by them of the libels and epithets applied to employees, plaintiffs, and customers, and the threats of injurious consequences to future customers, all linked together in a campaign were an unlawful annoyance and a hurtful nuisance in respect of the free access to the plaintiffs' place of business. It was not lawful persuasion or inducing. It was not a mere appeal to the sympathetic aid of would-be customers by a simple statement of the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 328]\n\u00a0\n fact of the strike and a request to withhold patronage. It was compelling every customer or wouldbe customer to run the gauntlet of most uncomfortable publicity, aggressive and annoying importunity, libelous attacks, and fear of injurious consequences, illegally inflicted, to his reputation and standing in the community. No wonder that a business of $50, 000 was reduced to only one-fourth of its former extent. Violence could not have been more effective. It was moral coercion by illegal annoyance and obstruction, and it thus was plainly a conspiracy.\n It would consume too great space to refer to the mass of authority which sustains this conclusion. It is sufficient to cite the general discussion of the subject in Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 439\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874. Well- known decisions on similar facts are Sherry v. Perkins, 147 Mass. 212, 17 N. E. 307, 9 Am. St. Rep. 689. Barr v. Essex Trades Council, 53 N. J. Eq. 101, 30 Atl. 881; Purvis v. Local No. 500, 214 Pa. 348, 63 Atl. 585, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 642, 112 Am. St. Rep. 757, 6 Ann. Cas. 275; Wilson v. Hey, 232 Ill. 389, 83 N. E. 928, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 85, 122 Am. St. Rep. 119, 13 Ann. Cas. 82; Casey v. Cincinnati Typographical Union (C. C.) 45 Fed. 135, 12 L. R. A. 193; Pierce v. Stablemen's Union, 156 Cal. 70, 103 Pac. 324.\n A law which operates to make lawful such a wrong as is described in plaintiffs' complaint deprives the owner of the business and the premises of his property without due process, and cannot be held valid under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The opinion of the state Supreme Court in this case, if taken alone, seems to show that the statute grants complete immunity from any civil or criminal action to the defendants, for it pronounces their acts lawful. If, however, we are to assume that the criminal laws of Arizona do provide prosecution for such libels against the plaintiffs, though committed by this particular class of tort-feasors (Truax v. Bisbee Local, 19 Ariz. 379, 171 Pac. 121), still the tort here committed was not a mere libel of plaintiffs. That would not have had any such serious consequences. The libel of the plaintiffs here was not the cause of the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 329]\n\u00a0\n injury; it was only one step or link in a conspiracy unlawfully to influence customers.\n It is argued that, while the right to conduct a lawful business is property, the conditions surrounding that business, such as regulations of the state for maintaining peace, good order, protection against disorder, are matters in which no person has a vested right. The conclusion to which this inevitably leads in this case is that the state may withdraw all protection to a property right by civil or criminal action for its wrongful injury, if the injury is not caused by violence. This doctrine is supposed to find support in the case of New York Central Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 198\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, and cases there cited. These cases, all of them, relate to the liabilities of employers to employees growing out of the relation of employment for injuries received in the course of employment. They concern legislation as to the incidents of that relation. They affirm the power of the state to vary the rules of the common law as to the fellow servant doctrine, assumption of risk, and negligence in that relation. They hold that employers have no vested right in those rules of the common law. The broad distinction between one's right to protection against a direct injury to one's fundamental property right by another who has no special relation to him, and one's liability to another with whom he establishes a voluntary relation under a statute is manifest upon its statement. It is true that no one has a vested right in any particular rule of the common law, but it is also true that the legislative power of a state can only be exerted in subordination to the fundamental principles of right and justice which the guaranty of due process in the Fourteenth Amendment is intended to preserve, and that a purely arbitrary or capricious exercise of that power whereby a wrongful and highly injurious invasion of property rights, as here, is practically sanctioned and the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 330]\n\u00a0\n owner stripped of all real remedy, is wholly at variance with those principles.\n It is to be observed that this is not the mere case of a peaceful secondary boycott as to the illegality of which courts have differed and states have adopted different statutory provisions. A secondary boycott of this kind is where many combine to injure one in his business by coercing third persons against their will to cease patronizing him by threats of similar injury. In such a case the many have a legal right to withdraw their trade from the one, they have the legal right to withdraw their trade from third persons, and they have the right to advise third persons of their intention to do so when each act is considered singly. The question in such cases is whether the moral coercion exercised over a stranger to the original controversy by steps in themselves legal becomes a legal wrong. But here the illegality of the means used is without doubt and fundamental. The means used are the libelous and abusive attacks on the plaintiffs' reputation, like attacks on their employees and customers, threats of such attacks on would-be customers, picketing and patrolling of the entrance to their place of business, and the consequent obstruction of free access thereto-all with the purpose of depriving the plaintiffs of their business. To give operation to a statute whereby serious losses inflicted by such unlawful means are in effect made remediless, is, we think, to disregard fundamental rights of liberty and property and to deprive the person suffering the loss of due process of law.\n If, however, contrary to the construction which we put on the opinion of the Supreme Court of Arizona, it does not withhold from the plaintiffs all remedy for the wrongs they suffered, but only the equitable relief of injunction, there still remains the question whether they are thus denied the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 331]\n\u00a0\n The Arizona constitution provides that the superior court shall have jurisdiction in all cases of equity and, in pursuance of this provision, paragraph 1456 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913 (Civ. Code), declares:\n'Judges of the superior courts may grant writs of injunction, returnable to said courts, in the following cases:\n\n'1. Where it shall appear that the party applying for such writ is entitled to the relief demanded, and such relief or any part thereof requires the restraint of some act prejudicial to the applicant.\n\n'2. Where pending litigation, it shall be made to appear that a party is doing some acts respecting the subject of litigation, or threatens, or is about to do some act, or is procuring or suffering the same to be done, in violation of the rights of the applicant, which act would tend to render the judgment ineffectual.\n\n'3. In all other cases where the applicant for such writ may show himself entitled thereto under the principles of equity.'\n\n The necessary and resulting effect of these provisions and of paragraph 1464 is that the plaintiffs in error would have had the right to an injunction against such a campaign as that conducted by the defendants in error, if it had been directed against the plaintiffs' business and property in any kind of a controversy which was not a dispute between employer and former employees. If the competing restaurant keepers in Bisbee had inaugurated such a campaign against the plaintiffs in error and conducted it with banners and handbills of a similar character, an injunction would necessarily have issued to protect the plaintiffs in the enjoyment of their property and business.\n This brings us to consider the effect in this case of that provision of the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids any state to deny to any person the equal protection of the laws. The clause is associated in the amendment \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 332]\n\u00a0\n with the due process clause and it is customary to consider them together. It may be that they overlap, that a violation of one may involve at times the violation of the other, but the spheres of the protection they offer are not coterminous. The due process clause brought down from Magna Charta was found in the early state constitutions and later in the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution as a limitation upon the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the federal government, while the equality clause does not appear in the Fifth Amendment and so does not apply to congressional legislation. The due process clause requires that every man shall have the protection of his day in court, and the benefit of the general law, a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds not arbitrarily or capriciously, but upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial, so that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society. Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 535\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 111. It, of course, tends to secure equality of law in the sense that it makes a required minimum of protection for every one's right of life, liberty, and property, which the Congress or the Legislature may not withhold. Our whole system of law is predicated on the general fundamental principle of equality of application of the law. 'All men are equal before the law,' 'This is a government of laws and not of men,' 'No man is above the law,' are all maxims showing the spirit in which Legislatures, executives and courts are expected to make, execute and apply laws. But the framers and adopters of this amendment were not content to depend on a mere minimum secured by the due process clause, or upon the spirit of equality which might not be insisted on by local public opinion. They therefore embodied that spirit in a specific guaranty.\n The guaranty was aimed at undue favor and individual or class privilege, on the one hand, and at hostile dis crimination \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 333]\n\u00a0\n or the oppression of inequality, on the other. It sought an equality of treatment of all persons, even though all enjoyed the protection of due process.\n Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of this court in Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 \nU.S. 27, 32\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 357, 360 (28 L. Ed. 923), of the equality clause, said:\n'Class legislation, discriminating against some and favoring others, is prohibited; but legislation which, in carrying out a public purpose, is limited in its application if, within the sphere of its operation, it affects alike all persons similarly situated, is not within the amendment.'\n\n In Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 350, the court, speaking through the same Justice, said the Fourteenth Amendment--\n'does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the objects to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate. It merely requires that all persons subject to such legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in privileges conferred and in liabilities imposed.'\n\n Thus the guaranty was intended to secure equality of protection not only for all but against all similarly situated. Indeed, protection is not protection unless it does so. Immunity granted to a class however limited, having the effect to deprive another class however limited of a personal or property right, is just as clearly a denial of equal protection of the laws to the latter class as if the immunity were in favor of, or the deprivation of right permitted worked against, a larger class.\n Mr. Justice Matthews, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1064, 1070 (30 L. Ed. 220), speaking for the court of both the due process and equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment said:\n'These provisions are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color or of nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 334]\n\u00a0\n The accuracy and comprehensive felicity of this description of the effect of the equality clause are shown by the frequency with which it has been quoted in the decisions of this court. It emphasizes the additional guaranty of a right which the clause has conferred beyond the requirement of due process.\n\n With these views of the meaning of the equality clause, it does not seem possible to escape the conclusion that by the clauses of paragraph 1464 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona (Civ. Code) here relied on by the defendants, as construed by its Supreme Court, the plaintiffs have been deprived of the equal protection of the law.\n It is beside the point to say that plaintiffs had no vested right in equity relief, and that taking it away does not deprive them of due process of law. If, as is asserted, the granting of equitable remedies falls within the police power, and is a matter which the Legislature may vary as its judgment and discretion shall dictate, this does not meet the objection under the equality clause which forbids the granting of equitable relief to one man and the denying of it to another under like circumstances and in the same territorial jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment, as this court said in Barbier v. Connolly, already ready cited, intended--\n'Lot only that there should be no arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty, or arbitrary spoliation of property, but that equal protection and security should be given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and civil rights; that all persons should be equally entitled to pursue their happiness and acquire and enjoy property; that they should have like access to the courts of the country for the protection of their persons and property, the prevention and redress of wrongs, and the enforcement of contract; that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of any one except as applied to the same pursuits by others under like circumstances; that no greater burdens should be laid upon one \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 335]\n\u00a0\n than are laid on others in the same calling and condition and that in the administration of criminal practice no different or higher punishment should be imposed upon one than such as is prescribed for all for like offenses.'\n\n If, as claimed, the Legislature has full discretion to grant or withhold equitable relief in any class of cases, indeed, to take away from its courts all equity jurisdiction and leave those who are wronged to suits at law or to protection by the criminal law, the Legislature has the same power in respect to the declaration of crimes. Suppose the Legislature of the state were to provide that such acts as were here committed by defendants, to wit, the picketing or patrolling of the sidewalk and street in front of the store or business house of any person and the use of handbills of an abusive and libelous character against the owner and present and future customers, with intent to injure the business of the owner, should be a public nuisance and be punishable by fine and imprisonment, and were to except ex-employees from its penal provisions. Is it not clear that any defendant could escape punishment under it on the ground that the statute violated the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? That is the necessary effect of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co ., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 431, where an anti-trust act was held invalid under this same clause because it contained the excepting provision that it should 'not apply to agricultural products or live stock while in the hands of the producer or raiser.' That was a stronger case than this because there the whole statute was one dealing with economic policy, and was a declaration of mala prohibita that had theretofore been lawful, from which it was strongly argued that the exception was justified in the interest of agriculture, and was a proper exception by permissible classification. Here is a direct invasion of the ordinary business and property rights of a person, unlawful when committed by any one, and remediable because \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 336]\n\u00a0\n of its otherwise irreparable character by equitable process, except when committed by ex-employees of the injured person. If this is not a denial of the equal protection of the laws, then it is hard to conceive what would be. To hold it not to be would be, to use the expression of Mr. Justice Brewer in Gulf Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 255, to make the guaranty of the equality clause 'a rope of sand.'\n In Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, we find one of the earlier and one of the most helpful discussions of the application of the equality clause to judicial procedure by Mr. Justice Bradley speaking for this court. In that case one who had been disbarred by the Court of Appeals of St. Louis sought to avoid the effect of this action by the contention that he was denied the equal protection of the laws because he was not given the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, granted to litigants in the state, except in St. Louis and three other counties. It was held that the equality clause did not apply, because the state Legislature had the right to vary the system of courts and procedure in various parts of the state. Mr. Justice Bradley said (\n101 U.S. 30\n):\n'The last restriction, as to the equal protection of the laws, is not violated by any diversity in the jurisdiction of the several courts as to subject-matter, amount, or finality of decision, if all persons within the territorial limits of their respective jurisdictions have an equal right, in like eases and under like circumstances, to resort to them for redress.'\n\n Again (\n101 U.S. 31\n):\n'For as before said, it [i. e., the equality clause] had respect to persons and classes of persons. It means that no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under like circumstances.'\n\n To sustain the distinction here between the ex-employees and other tort-feasors in the matter of remedies \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 337]\n\u00a0\n against them, it is contended that the Legislature may establish a class of such ex-employees for special legislative treatment. In adjusting legislation to the need of the people of a state, the Legislature has a wide discretion, and it may be fully conceded that perfect uniformity of treatment of all persons is neither practical nor desirable, that classification of persons is constantly necessary, and that questions of proper classification are not free from difficulty. But we venture to think that not in any of the cases in this court has classification of persons of sound mind and full responsibility, having no special relation to each other, in respect of remedial procedure for an admitted tort been sustained. Classification must be reasonable. As was said in Gulf Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 155\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 257:\n'Classification ... must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.'\n\n As was said in Magoun v. Illinois Trust Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 594, 598 (42 L. Ed. 1037):\n'The rule [i. e., of the equality clause] is not a substitute for municipal law; it only prescribes that that law have the attribute of equality of operation, and equality ... does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to their relations.'\n\n The same principle is repeated and enforced in Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 417\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 291 (54 L. Ed. 536, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247):\n'While reasonable classification is permitted, without doing violence to the equal protection of the laws, such classification must be based upon some real and substantial distinction, bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which such classification is imposed; and classification cannot be arbitrarily made without any substantial basis.'\n\n Classification is the most inveterate of our reasoning processes. We can scarcely think or speak without consciously or unconsciously exercising it. It must therefore obtain in \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 338]\n\u00a0\n and determine legislation; but it must regard real resemblances and real differences between things and persons, and class them in accordance with their pertinence to the purpose in hand. Classification like the one with which we are here dealing is said to be the development of the philosophic thought of the world and is opening the door to legalized experiment. When fundamental rights are thus attempted to be taken away, however, we may well subject such experiment to attentive judgment. The Constitution was intended-its very purpose was-to prevent experimentation with the fundamental rights of the individual. We said through Mr. Justice Brewer, in Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957, that--\n'It is the peculiar value of a written constitution that it places in unchanging form limitations upon legislative action, and thus gives a permanence and stability to popular government which otherwise would be lacking.'\n\n It is urged that this court has frequently recognized the special classification of the relations of employees and employers as proper and necessary for the welfare of the community and requiring special treatment. This is undoubtedly true, but those cases-the Second Employer's Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 U.S. 210\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 U.S. 152\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 227; Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537-as we have already pointed out in discussing the due process clause, were cases of the responsibility of the employer for injuries sustained by employees in the course of their employment. The general end of such legislation is that the employer shall become the insurer of the employee against injuries from the employment without regard to the negligence, if any, through which it occurred, leaving to the employer to protect himself by insurance and to compensate himself for the additional cost of production \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 339]\n\u00a0\n by adding to the prices he charges for his products. It seems a far cry from classification on the basis of the relation of employer and employee in respect of injuries received in course of employment to classification based on the relation of an employer, not to an employee, but to one who has ceased to be so, in respect of torts thereafter committed by such ex- employee on the business and property right of the employer. It is really a little difficult to say, if such classification can be sustained, why special legislative treatment of assaults upon an employer or his employees by ex-employees may not be sustained with equal reason. It is said the state may deal separately with such disputes because such controversies are a frequent and characteristic outgrowth of disputes over terms and conditions of employment. Violence of ex-employees toward present employees is also a characteristic of such disputes. Would this justify a Legislature in excepting ex-employees from criminal prosecution for such assaults and leaving the assaulted persons to suits for damages at common law?\n Our conclusion, that plaintiffs are denied the equal protection of the laws, is sustained by the decisions in this court in Truax v. Raich, \n239 U.S. 33\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas 1917B, 283; Atchison & Santa Fe Ry. v. Vosburg, \n238 U.S. 56\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 675, L. R. A. 1615E, 953; Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 431; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 U.S. 79\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 30; Gulf Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 255. In the state courts, we find equal support for it. Bogni v. Perotti, 224 Mass. 152, 112 N. E. 853, L. R. A. 1916A, 831; Pearson v. Portland, 60 Me. 278, 31 Am. Rep. 276. Goldberg, Bowen & Co. v. Stablemen's Union, 149 Cal. 429, 434, 86 Pac. 806, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 460, 117 Am. St. Rep. 145, 9 Ann. Cas. 1219; Pieice v.

Law Rep. 286. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 340]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that, in holding paragraph 1464 invalid, we are in effect holding invalid section 20 of the Clayton Act (Comp. St.  1243d). Of course, we are not doing so. In the first place, the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to congressional, but only to state, action. In the second place, section 20 of the Clayton Act never has been construed or applied as the Supreme Court of Arizona has construed and applied paragraph 1464 in this case.\n We have but recently considered the clauses of section 20 of the Clayton Act, sometimes erroneously called the 'picketing' clauses. American Steel Foundries v. TriCity Trades Council, \n257 U.S. 184\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 72, opinion announced December 5th. They forbid an injunction in labor controversies prohibiting--\n'any person ... from attending at any place where any such person ... may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do.'\n\n We held that under these clauses picketing was unlawful, and that it might be enjoined as such, and that peaceful picketing was a contradiction in terms which the statute sedulously avoided, but that subject to the primary right of the employer and his employees and would-be employees to free access to his premises without obstruction by violence, intimidation, annoyance, importunity, or dogging, it was lawful for ex-employees on a strike and their fellows in a labor union to have a single representative at each entrance to the plant of the employer to announce the strike and peaceably to persuade the employees and would-be employees to join them in it. We held that these clauses were merely declaratory of what had always been the law and the best practice in equity, and we thus applied them. The construction put \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 341]\n\u00a0\n upon the same words by the Arizona Supreme Court makes these clauses of paragraph 1464 as far from those of section 20 of the Clayton Act in meaning as if they were in wholly different language.\n We conclude that the demurrer in this case should have been overruled, the defendants required to answer, and that if the evidence sustain the averments of the complaint, an injunction should issue as prayed.\n Objection is made to this conclusion on the ground that as we hold certain clauses of paragraph 1464 of the Arizona Code, as construed, invalid, they cannot be separated from paragraph 1456, which must also be held invalid, and then there is no law in Arizona authorizing an injunction in this or any case. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 431, is cited to sustain this view. There a new anti-trust statute was enacted, making criminal and subject to injunction what before had not been so. The exception from its operation of products of the farm in the hands of the producers, contained in the law as enacted, was declared to be a denial of equal protection of the laws, and the whole law was declared invalid because the court, in view of the exception, could not assume that the Legislature would have enacted the law, had it known that the producers of farm products would have come within its terms. But here the case is quite different. Paragraph 1456 has been the statute law of Arizona, state and territory, since 1901. It was first adopted in the Code of the territory of 1901. It was continued in force, by virtue of the new Constitution of Arizona adopted by the people in 1912, which merely changed the name of the court, upon which general equity jurisdiction was conferred, from the district court to the superior court, and which provided that the authority, jurisdiction, practice, and procedure of the district courts should continue in force and apply and govern superior courts until altered or repealed. Arizona came into the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 342]\n\u00a0\n Union with this Constitution February 14, 1912. At the session of 1912 provision was made for revision and codification of the laws. The present Code was adopted by the Legislature at its third special session of 1913. Paragraph 1464 was passed, as the Code itself states, at the second session of 1913. Thus paragraph 1464 was an amendment to paragraph 1456, and was included with the original section in the Code revision of 1913. To invalidate paragraph 1456 we must assume that, had the Legislature known that the clauses of paragraph 1464 here involved, construed as the Arizona Supreme Court has construed them, were unconstitutional, it would have repealed all the existing law conferring the equitable power of injunction on its first instance courts of general jurisdiction. We cannot make this assumption. The exception introduced by amendment to paragraph 1456 proving invalid, the original law stands without the amendatory exception.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n The dangers of a delusive exactness in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment have been adverted to before now. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 466. Delusive exactness is a source of fallacy throughout the law. By calling a business 'property' you make it seem like land, and lead up to the conclusion that a statute cannot substantially cut down the advantages of ownership existing before the statute was passed. An established business no doubt may have pecuniary value and commonly is protected by law against various unjustified injuries. But you cannot give it definiteness of contour by calling it a thing. It is a course of conduct and like other conduct is \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 343]\n\u00a0\n subject to substantial modification according to time and circumstances both in itself and in regard to what shall justify doing it a harm. I cannot understand the notion that it would be unconstitutional to authorize boycotts and the like in aid of the employees' or the employers' interest by statute when the same result has been reached constitutionally without statute by courts with whom I agree. See The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 404\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 133. In this case it does not even appear that the business was not created under the laws as they now are. Denny v. Bennett, \n128 U.S. 489\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 134.\n I think further that the selection of the class of employers and employees for special treatment, dealing with both sides alike, is beyond criticism on principles often asserted by this court. And especially I think that without legalizing the conduct complained of the extraordinary relief by injunction may be denied to the class. Legislation may begin where an evil begins. If, as many intelligent people believe, there is more danger that the injunction will be abused in labor cases than elsewhere I can fell no doubt of the power of the Legislature to deny it in such cases. I refer to two decisions in which I have stated what I understand to be the law sanctioned by many other decisions. Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 66; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 U.S. 59\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 192.\n In a matter like this I dislike to turn attention to anything but the fundamental question of the merits, but Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 431, raises at least a doubt in my mind of another sort. The exception and the rule as to granting injunctions are both part of the same Code, enacted at the same time. If the exception fails, according to the Connolly Case the statute is bad as a whole. It is true that here the exception came in later than the rule, but after they had been amalgamated in a single act I cannot know that the later Legis lature \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 344]\n\u00a0\n WOULD HAVE KEPT THE RULE IF THE EXCEPTION could not be allowed. if labor had the ascendancy that the exception seems to indicate, I think that probably it would have declined to allow injunctions in any case if that was the only way of reaching its end. But this is a matter upon which the state court has the last word, and if it takes this view its decision must prevail. I need not press further the difficulty of requiring a state court to issue an injunction that it never has been empowered to issue by the quasi sovereign that created the court.\n I must add one general consideration. There is nothing that I more deprecate than the use of the Fourteenth Amendment beyond the absolute compulsion of its words to prevent the making of social experiments that an important part of the community desires, in the insulated chambers afforded by the serveral states, even though the experiments may seem futile or even noxious to me and to those whose judgment I most respect. I agree with the more elaborate expositions of my Brothers PITNEY and BRANDEIS and in their conclusion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n The Supreme Court of the state of Arizona sustained, against objections raised by plaintiffs in error under the 'due process of law' and 'equal protection' clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, a statutory provision found in paragraph 1464, Arizona Civil Code 1913, which restricts the employment of the process of injunction against what are called peaceful picketing and boycotting under certain circumstances, in terms similar to those found in section 20 of the Clayton Act of Congress ( Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 738 [Comp. St.  1243d]). \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 345]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiffs in error, who were plaintiffs in the trial court and appellants in the Supreme Court of the state, were engaged in the business of conducting a restaurant in Bisbee, enjoying and dependent for success upon the good will, custom, and patronage of the public; defendants had been employed, in one capacity or another, in the restaurant, and were members of a local labor union. A dispute arose concerning the terms and conditions of the employment, and in the course of it demands were made upon plaintiffs by the union, with which plaintiffs refused to comply. Because of this the union ordered a strike of all its members then employed by plaintiffs, and defendants joined in the strike and left plaintiffs' employ. Thereupon, for the purpose of winning the strike and \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 346]\n\u00a0\n coercing plaintiffs into complying with the demands of the union, defendants and numerous other persons unknown combined to inaugurate and did inaugurate a boycott of plaintiffs and their restaurant business, in order to induce plaintiffs' customers and patrons to refrain from patronizing the restaurant. In furtherance of the boycott defendants caused persons to walk back and forth along the street in front of the restaurant and near to the entrance during business hours, carrying banners bearing conspicuous notices denouncing plaintiffs as unfair to organized labor, etc., and caused printed handbills to be distributed among plaintiffs' customers and patrons recommending and attempting to persuade them to refrain from patronizing the restaurant. Having sustained serious pecuniary loss, and being threatened with further and irreparable damage, plaintiffs brought suit for injunction, setting up that defendants were relying upon the provisions of paragraph 1464 of the Civil Code, and praying that this might be held violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and that they might have an injunction and other relief.\n The Supreme Court, conceding that prior to the enactment of paragraph 1464 picketing carried on in any manner, even in a concededly peaceable manner, was unlawful by the law of Arizona, nevertheless, upon authority of a previous case decided by it upon substantially identical facts (Truax v. Bisbee Local, No. 380, 19 Ariz. 379, 392, 171 Pac. 121), held that relief was barred by the statute (Truax v. Corrigan, 20 Ariz. 7, 176 Pac. 570).\n Upon the facts, it hardly could be said that defendants kept within the bounds of a 'peaceful' picket or boycott. They appear to have gone beyond mere attempts to persuade plaintiffs' customers to withdraw their patronage, and to have resorted to abusive and threatening language towards the patrons themselves. The court declared, however, that the statute established a new rule \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 347]\n\u00a0\n of evidence for determining whether picketing was peaceful and not otherwise unlawful, and that, measured by the standard thus prescribed, defendants were not subject to injunction. by this construction we are bound, and the only question is whether by the statute as so construed, and as applied to the facts of the case, plaintiffs are deprived of rights secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n As to this, I regret that I am not in accord with the views of the majority of the court. Expressing no opinion as to the wisdom, or policy, or propriety in the general sense of paragraph 1464-with neither of which is our duty concerned-I consider first, whether, as construed and applied, it has the effect of depriving plaintiffs in error of their liberty or property without due process of law.\n It is beside the question to discuss whether under the rules of the common law or the general principles of justice, picketing or boycotting, or the conduct of defendants however described, is lawful. The Supreme Court of Arizona virtually conceded that in that state, in the absence of statute, they were not. The question is whether in this respect the law might be altered by act of legislation, to the extent of depriving a party aggrieved, and threatened with irreparable injury, of relief by injunction.\n That the right to conduct a lawful business, and thereby acquire pecuniary profits, is property, is indisputable. That the state of society, and the existing condition of good order, or the opposite, surrounding the business, and its liability to or immunity from interruption through particular forms of disorder, affect its profitableness, likewise is plain. But it seems to me clear that, so far as these result from the general operation of the laws and regulations established by authority of the state for maintaining the peace, good order, and tranquility of its people and affording protection against disturbing elements \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 348]\n\u00a0\n and ill-disposed persons, those laws and regulations, as rules of conduct and measures of relief, are subject to be changed in the normal exercise of the legislative power of the state. That no person has a vested interest in any rule of law, entitling him to have it remain unaltered for his benefit, is a principle thoroughly settled by numerous decisions of this court, and having general application, not confined at all to the rights and liabilities existing between employers and employees, or between persons formerly occupying that relation. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 134; Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 532\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 111, 292; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Chicago & Alton R. R. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 76\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 678; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 198\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629.\n The use of the process of injunction to prevent disturbance of a going business by such a campaign as defendants here have conducted, is in the essential sense a measure of police regulation. And just as the states have a broad discretion about establishing police regulations, so they have a discretion, equally broad, about modifying and relaxing them. They may adopt the common law, or some other system, as their own judgment of the interests of their people may determine. They have general dominion, and saving as restricted by particular provisions of the federal Constitution, complete dominion over all persons, property, and business transactions within their borders; and in regulating its internal affairs a state may establish by legislation a policy differing in one or more respects from those of other states, just as it might establish a like difference through the decisions of its courts.\n Hence I have no doubt that, without infringing the 'due process' clause, a state might by statute establish protection against picketing or boycotting however conducted, just as many states have done by holding them to be contrary to the common law recognizing a property \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 349]\n\u00a0\n value in a going business, and applying equitable principles in safeguarding it from irreparable injury through interference found unwarranted. Vegelahn v. Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, 97, 98, 44 N. E. 1077, 35 L. R. A. 722, 57 Am. St. Rep. 443; Beck v. Railway Teamsters' Protective Union, 118 Mich. 497, 520, 521, 77 N. W. 13, 42 L. R.

And, just as one state might establish such protection by statute, so another state may by statute disestablish the protection, even as states have differed in their judicial determination of the general law upon the subject. In neither case can I find ground for declaring that the state's action is so arbitrary and devoid of reasonable basis that it can be called a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law, in the constitutional sense. In truth, the states have a considerable degree of latitude in determining, each for itself, their respective conditions of law and order, and what kind of civilization they shall have as a result.\n Paragraph 1464 does not modify any substantive rule of law, but only restricts the processes of the courts of equity. Ordinary legal remedies remain; and I cannot believe that the use of the injunction in such cases- however important-is so essential to the right of acquiring, possessing and enjoying property that its restriction or elimination amounts to a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Secondly, it is said that paragraph 1464, Arizona Civil Code, denies to plaintiffs in error the 'equal protection of the laws'; but it seems to me evident that it does not offend in this regard. Examination shows that it does not discriminate against the class to which plaintiffs belong \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 350]\n\u00a0\n in favor of any other. It applies not only to cases between employers and employees, irrespective of who is plaintiff and who defendant, but to cases between employees, and between persons employed and those seeking employment. And it applies equally to all persons coming within its reach.\n It is said that because, under other provisions of the Arizona statute law, plaintiffs would have been entitled to an injunction against such a campaign as that conducted by defendants, had it been in a controversy other than a dispute between employer and former employees-for instance, had competing restaurant keepers been the offenders-refusal of relief in the particular case by force of paragraph 1464 is undue favoritism to the class of which defendants are members. But I submit with deference that this is not a matter of which plaintiffs are entitled to complain under the 'equal protection' clause. There is no discrimination as against them; others situated like them are accorded no greater right to an injunction than is accorded to them. Whatever complaint the competing restaurant keepers might have, if in the case supposed they were subject to be stopped by an injunction where former employees were not, it would not be a denial of equal protection to plaintiffs. Cases arising under this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pre-eminently, call for the application of the settled rule that before one may be heard to oppose state legislation upon the ground of its repugnance to the federal Constitution he must bring himself within the class affected by the alleged unconstitutional feature. Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 U.S. 260\n, 270-271, 33 Sup. Ct. 27, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 71; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 149\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 237; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 U.S. 152\n, 156-157, 39 Sup. Ct. 227.\n A disregard of the rule in the present case has resulted, as it seems to me, in treating as a discrimination what, so \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 351]\n\u00a0\n far as plaintiffs are concerned, is no more than a failure to include in the statute a case which in consistency ought, it is said, to have been covered-an omission immaterial to plaintiffs. This is to transform the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment from a guaranty of the 'protection of equal laws' into an insistence upon laws complete, perfect, symmetrical.\n The guaranty of 'equal protection' entitles plaintiffs to treatment not less favorable than that given to others similarly circumstanced. This the present statute gives the. The provision does not entitle them, as against their present opponents under present circumstances, to protection as adequate as they might have against opponents of another class under like circumstances. I find no authority for the proposition that the guaranty was intended to secure equality of protection 'not only for all but against all similarly situated,' except as between persons who properly belong in the same class. The familiar expression, in Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 \nU.S. 27, 32\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 357, 360 (28 L. Ed. 923), 'Class legislation, discriminating against some and favoring others,' refers to a discrimination which at the same time favors others similarly situated. The same is true of what was said in Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 71- 72, 7 Sup. Ct. 350, 352 (30 L. Ed. 578), to the effect that the Amendment 'merely requires that all persons subjected to such legislation shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed.' Other decisions are to the same effect. Nothing in the Arizona statute under consideration, either as written or as construed and applied, operates to discriminate against plaintiffs in favor of others similarly circumstanced and conditioned. Neither class of supposed offenders-those exempt from or those subject to injunction-stands in like case with plaintiffs who seek an injunction.\n But, assuming plaintiffs were entitled to assert, as a denial of equal protection, the alleged discrimination arising \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 352]\n\u00a0\n from a denial of equitable relief in one class of cases which would be granted in another, I am unable to see that the statute creates an arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination in this regard.\n It is going far-too far, I submit-to assume that there is any discrimination in fact. Such a campaign as that conducted by defendants, the Legislature foresaw, was likely to be resorted to by employees or former employees, in the case of a dispute with the employer concerning terms or conditions of employment. In such a case, for reasons deemed sufficient, the Legislature declared there should be no injunction. That such picketing or boycotting ever was conducted in Arizons, or that the Legislature had reason to anticipate that it would be undertaken in the future, by competitors in business or any others than participants in a labor dispute, does not appear and cannot be assumed. Without this, the supposed discrimination is but theoretical, not practical.\n But were there actual discrimination, granting immunity from injunction to laboring men who resort to unlawful conduct in the way of picketing, boycotting and the like, seriously interfering with the employer's business, while denying the like immunity to other classes who may resort to similar unlawful and harmful conduct, but with what the Legislature probably regarded as a slighter claim to indulgence, I cannot agree that this demonstrates the classification to be so arbitrary and unreasonable as to render the act a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Doubtless the Legislature, upon a review of the subject in the light of a knowledge of conditions in their own state that we do not possess, concluded that in labor controversies there were reasons affecting the public interest for preventing resort to the process of injunction and leaving the parties to the ordinary legal remedies, which reasons did not apply generally. The simple truth is they merely singled out, as properly they \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 353]\n\u00a0\n might, a particular kind of controversy for what they regarded as appropriate treatment; and, as already shown, they acted upon it in a manner consistent with due process of law. There is here no denial of equal protection. Legislation almost of necessity proceeds subject by subject, with classification as an essential part of the process. In adjusting their laws to the needs of the people, the states have a wide range of discretion about classification; the equal protection clause does not require that all state laws shall be perfect and complete, nor that the entire field of proper legislation shall be covered by a single act; and it is not a valid objection that a law made applicable to one subject might properly have been extended to others. Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 U.S. 260\n, 270-271, 33 Sup. Ct. 27, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 71; Missouri, Kan. & Texas Ry. v. Cade, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 649-650, 34 Sup. Ct. 678. All employers' liability and workmen's compensation laws proceed upon the basis that the responsibility of employers for injuries sustained by employees forms a proper subject for separate treatment. See Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 U.S. 210\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 U.S. 152\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 227; Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537. And I see no adequate reason for denying the authority of a state to deal separately with those controversies between employer and employees or between persons employed and those seeking employment, which experience has shown to be a characteristic outgrowth of disputes over the terms and conditions of employment.\n I am unable to conclude that paragraph 1464 either deprives plaintiffs in error of liberty or property without due process of law, or denies to them the equal protection of the laws, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs in the above opinion. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting.\n The first Legislature of the state of Arizona adopted in 1913 a Civil Code. By title 6, chapter 3, it sets forth conditions and circumstances under which the courts of the state may or may not grant injunctions. Paragraph 1464 contains, among other things, a prohibition against interfering by injunction between employers and employees, in any case growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless interposition by injunction is necessary to protect property from injury through violence. Its main purpose was doubtless to prohibit the courts from enjoining peaceful picketing and the boycott. With the wisdom of the statute we have no concern. Whether Arizona in enacting this statute transgressed limitations imposed upon the power of the states by the Fourteenth Amendment is the question presented for decision.\n The employer has, of course, a legal right to carry on his business for profit, and incidentally the subsidiary rights to secure and retain customers, to fix such prices for his product as he deems proper, and to buy merchandise and labor at such prices as he chooses to pay. This right to carry on business-be it called liberty or property-has value, and he who interferes with the right without cause renders himself liable. But for cause the right may be interfered with and even be destroyed. Such cause exists when, in the pursuit of an equal right to further their several interests, his competitors make inroads upon his trade, or when suppliers of merchandise or of labor make inroads upon his profits. What methods and means are permissible in this struggle of contending forces is determined in part by decisions of the courts, in part by acts of the Legislatures. The rules governing the contest necessarily change from time to time. For conditions change, and, furthermore, the rules evolved, being merely experiments \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 355]\n\u00a0\n in government, must be discarded when they prove to be failures.\n Practically every change in the law governing the relation of employer and employee must abridge, in some respect, the liberty or property of one of the parties-if liberty and property be measured by the standard of the law therefore prevailing. If such changes are made by acts of the Legislature, we call the modification an exercise of the police power. And, although the change may involve interference with existing liberty and property of individuals, the statute will not be declared a violation of the due process clause, unless the court finds that the interference is arbitrary or unreasonable or that, considered as a means, the measure has no real or substantial relation of cause to a permissible end. \n1\n Nor will such changes in the law governing contests between employer and employee be held to be violative of the equal protection clause merely because the liberty or property of individuals in other relations to each other (for instance, as competitors in trade or as vendor and purchaser) would not, under similar circumstances, be subject to like abridgment. Few laws are of universal application. It is of the nature of our law that it has dealt, not with man in general, but with him in relationships. That a peculiar relationship of individuals may furnish legal basis for the classification which satisfies the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment 2 is clear. That the relation of employer \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 356]\n\u00a0\n and employee affords a constitutional basis for legislation applicable only to persons standing in that relation has been repeatedly held by this court. \n3\n The questions submitted are whether this statutory prohibition of the remedy by injunction is in itself arbitrary and so unreasonable as to deprive the employer of liberty or property without due process of law, and whether limitation of this prohibition to controversies involving employment denies him equal protection of the laws.\n Whether a law enacted in the exercise of the police power is justly subject to the charge of being unreasonable or arbitrary can ordinarily be determined only by a consideration of the contemporary conditions, social, industrial and political, of the community to be affected thereby. Resort to such facts is necessary, among other things, in order to appreciate the evils sought to be \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 357]\n\u00a0\n remedied and the possible effects of the remedy proposed. Nearly all legislation involves a weighing of public needs as against private desires, and likewise a weighing of relative social values. Since government is not an exact science, prevailing public opinion concerning the evils and the remedy is among the important facts deserving consideration, particularly when the public conviction is both deep-seated and widespread and has been reached after deliberation. \n4\n What, at any particular time, is the paramount public need, is necessarily largely a matter of judgment. Hence, in passing upon the validity of a law charged as being unreasonable, aid may be derived from the experience of other countries and of the several states of our Union in which the common law and its conceptions of liberty and of property prevail. The history of the rules governing contests between employer and employed in the several English-speaking countries illustrates both the susceptibility of such rules to change and the variety of contemporary opinion as to what rules will best serve the public interest. The divergence of opinion in this difficult field of governmental action should admonish us not to declare a rule arbitrary and unreasonable merely because we are convinced that it is fraught with danger to the public weal, and thus to close the door to experiment within the law.\n In England a workingman struggling to improve his condition, even when acting singly, was confronted until 1813 with laws limiting the amount of wages which he might demand. \n5\n Until 1824 he was punishable as a criminal if he combined with his fellow workmen to raise wages or shorten hours or to affect the business in any \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 358]\n\u00a0\n way, even if there was no resort to a strike. \n6\n Until 1871 members of a union who joined in persuading employees to leave work were liable criminally, although the employees were not under contract and the persuasion was both peaceful and unattended by picketing. \n7\n Until 1871 threatening a strike, whatever the cause, was also a criminal act. \n8\n Not until 1875 was the right of workers to combine in order to attain their ends conceded fully. In that year Parliament declared that workmen combining in furtherance of a trade dispute should not be indictable for criminal conspiracy unless the act, if done by one person, would be indictable as a crime. \n9\n After that statute a combination of workmen to effect the ordinary objects of a strike was no longer a criminal offense. But picketing, though peaceful, in aid of a strike, remained illegal,10 and likewise the boycott. \n11\n Not until 1906 was the ban on \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 359]\n\u00a0\n peaceful picketing and the bringing of pressure upon an employer by means of a secondary strike or a boycott removed. \n12\n In 1906, also, the act of inducing workers to break their contract of employment (previously held an actionable wrong)13 was expressly declared legal. \n14\n In England improvement of the condition of workingmen \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 360]\n\u00a0\n and their emancipation appear to have been deemed recently the paramount public need.\n In the British dominions the rules governing the struggle between employer and employed were likewise subjected to many modifications; but the trend of social experiment took a direction very different from that followed in the mother country. Instead of enabling the worker to pursue such methods as he might deem effective in the contest, statutes were enacted in some of the dominions which forbade the boycott, peaceful picketing, and even the simple strike and the lockout;15 use of the injunction to enforce compliance with these prohibitions was expressly sanctioned;16 and violations of the statute \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 361]\n\u00a0\n was also made punishable by criminal proceedings. \n17\n These prohibitions were the concomitants of prescribed industrial arbitration through administrative tribunals by which the right of both employer and employee to liberty and property were seriourly abridged in the public interest. Australia18 and New Zealand19 made compulsory both arbitration and compliance with the award. \n20\n Canada limited the compulsion to a postponement of the right to strike until the dispute should have been officially investigated and reported upon. \n21\n In these dominions the uninterrupted pursuit of industry and the prevention of the arbitrary use of power appear to be deemed the paramount public needs.\n In the United States the rules of the common law governing the struggle between employer and employee have likewise been subjected to \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 362]\n\u00a0\n been made mainly through judicial decisions. The legal right of workingmen to combine and to strike in order to securer for themselves higher wages, shorter hours and better working conditions received early generaly recognition. \n22\n But there developed great diversity of opinion as to the means by which,23 and also as to the persons through whom,24 and upon whom 25 pressure might permissibly be \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 363]\n\u00a0\n exerted in order to induce the employer to yield to the demands of the workingmen. Courts were required, in the absence of legislation, to determine what the public welfare demanded, whether it would not be best subserved by leaving the contestants free to resort to any means not involving a breach of the peace or injury to tangible property, whether it was consistent with the public interest that the contestants should be permitted to invoke the aid of others not directly interested in the matter in controversy, and to what extent incidental injury to persons not parties to the controversy should be held justifiable.\n The earliest reported American decision on peaceful picketing appears to have been rendered in 188826; the earliest on boycotting in 1886.27 By no great majority the prevailing judicial opinion in America declares the boycott \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 364]\n\u00a0\n as commonly practiced an illegal means28 (see Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 U.S. 443\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 172), while it inclines \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 365]\n\u00a0\n towards the legality of peaceful picketing. \n29\n See American can Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 U.S. 184\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 72. But in some of the states, notably New York, both peaceful picketing and the boycott are declared permissible. \n30\n Judges being thus called upon to exercise a quasi legislative function and weigh relative social values, naturally differed in their conclusion on such questions. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n[257 U.S. 312, 366]\n\u00a0\n In England, observance of the rules of the contest has been enforced by the courts almost wholly through the criminal law or through actions at law for compensation. An injunction was granted in a labor dispute as early as 1868.32 But in England resort to the injunction has not been frequent and it has played no appreciable part there in conflict between capital and labor. In America the injunction did not secure recognition as a possible remedy until 1888.33 When a few years later its use became extensive and conspicuous, the controversy over the remedy overshadowed in bitterness the question of the relative substantive rights of the parties. In the storms of protest against this use many thoughtful lawyers joined. 34 The equitable remedy, although applied in accordance with established practice, involved incidents which, it was asserted, endangered the personal liberty of wage earners. The acts enjoined were frequently, perhaps usually, acts which were already crimes at common law or had been made so by statutes. The issues in litigation arising out of trade disputes related largely to questions of fact. But in equity issues of fact as of law were tried by a single judge, sitting without a jury. Charges of violating an \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 367]\n\u00a0\n injunction were often heard on affidavits merely, without the opportunity of confronting or cross-examining witnesses. \n35\n Men found guilty of contempt were committed in the judge's discretion, without either a statutory limit upon the length of the imprisonment, or the opportunity of effective review on appeal, or the right to release on bail pending possible revisory proceedings. \n36\n The effect of the proceeding upon the individual was substantially the same as if he had been successfully prosecuted for a crime; but he was denied, in the course of the equity proceedings, those rights which by the Constitution are commonly secured to persons charged with a crime.\n It was asserted that in these proceedings an alleged danger to property, always incidental and at times insignificant, was often laid hold of to enable the penalties of the criminal law to be enforced expeditiously without that protection to the liberty of the individual which the Bill of Rights was designed to afford; that through such proceedings a single judge often usurped the functions not only of the jury but of the police department; that in prescribing the conditions under which strikes were permissible, \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 368]\n\u00a0\n and how they might be carried out, he usurped also the powers of the Legislature; and that incidentally he abridged the constitutional rights of individuals to free speech, to a free press, and to peaceful assembly.\n It was urged that the real motive in seeking the injunction was not ordinarily to prevent property from being injured nor to protect the owner in its use, but to endow property with active, militant power which would make it dominant over men; in other words, that under the guise of protecting property rights, the employer was seeking sovereign power. And many disinterested men, solicitous only for the public welfare, believed that the law of property was not appropriate for dealing with the forces beneath social unrest; that in this vast struggle it was unwise to throw the power of the state on one side or the other, according to principles deduced from that law; that the problem of the control and conduct of industry demanded a solution of its own; and that, pending the ascertainment of new principles to govern industry, it was wiser for the state not to interfere in industrial struggles by the issuance of an injunction. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n After the constitutionality and the propriety of the use of the injunction in labor disputes was established judicially, those who opposed the practice sought the aid of Congress and of state Legislatures. The bills introduced varied in character and in scope. Many dealt merely with rights; and, of these, some declared, in effect, that no act done in furtherance of a labor dispute by a combination of workingmen should be held illegal, unless it would \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 369]\n\u00a0\n have been so, if done by a single individual, while others purported to legalize specific practices, like boycotting or picketing. Other bills dealt merely with the remedy; and, of these, some undertook practically to abolish the use of the injunction in labor disputes, while some merely limited its use either by prohibiting its issue under certain conditions or by denying power to restrain certain acts. Some bills undertook to modify both rights and remedies. \n38\n These legislative proposals occupied the attention of Congress during every session but one in the 20 years between 1894 and 1914.39 Reports recommending such legislation \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 370]\n\u00a0\n were repeatedly made by the judiciary committee of the House or that of the Senate, and at some session by both. \n40\n Prior to 1914, legislation of this character had at several sessions passed the House,41 and in that year Congress passed and the President approved the Clayton Act, section 20 of which is substantially the same as paragraph 1464 of the Arizona Civil Code. Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 738.\n Such was the diversity of view concerning peaceful picketing and the boycott expressed in judicial decisions and legislation in English- speaking countries when in 1913 the new state of Arizona, in establishing its judicial system, limited the use of the injunction, and when in 1918 its Supreme Court was called upon to declare for the first time the law of Arizona on these subjects. The case of Truax v. Bisbee Local, No. 380, 19 Ariz 379, 171 Pac. 121, presented facts identical with those of the case at bar. \n42\n In that case the Supreme Court made its decision on four controverted points of law. In the first place, it held that the officials of the union were not outsiders with no justification for their acts. 19 Ariz. 379, 390. 171 Pac. 121.43 In the second place, rejecting the view held by the federal courts and the majority of the state courts on the illegality of the boycott, it \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 371]\n\u00a0\n specifically accepted the law of New York, Montana, and California, citing the decisions of those states. 19 Ariz. 379, 388, 390, 171 Pac. 121.44 In the third place it rejected the law of New Jersey, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania that it is illegal to circularize an employer's customers, and again adopted the rule declared in the decisions of the courts of New York, Montana, California, and Connecticut, 19 Ariz. 379, 389, 171 Pac. 121.45 In deciding these three points the Supreme Court of Arizona made a choice between well-established precedents laid down on either side by some of the strongest courts in the country. Can this court say that thereby it deprived the plaintiff of his property without due process of law?\n The fourth question requiring decision was whether peaceful picketing should be deemed legal. Here, too, each of the opposing views had the support of decisions of strong courts. \n46\n If the Arizona court had decided that by the common law of the state the defendants might peacefully picket the plaintiff, its decision, like those of the courts of Ohio, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire, would surely not have been open to objection under the federal Constitution; for this court has recently held that peaceful picketing is not unlawful. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, supra. The Supreme Court of Arizona Found it unnecessary to determine what was the common law of the state on that subject, because it construed paragraph 1464 of the Civil Code as declaring peaceful picketing to be legal. In the case at bar, commenting on the earlier case, the court said:\n'The statute adopts the view of a number of courts which have held picketing, \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 372]\n\u00a0\n if peaceably carried on for a lawful purpose, to be no violation of any legal right of the party whose place of business is picketed, and whether as a fact the picketing is carried on by peaceful means, as against the other view taken by the federal courts and many of the state courts that picketing is per se unlawful.'\n\n Shortly before that decision the Criminal Court of Appeals of Oklahoma had placed a similar construction upon a statute of that state, declaring that--\n'The doctrine [that picketing is not per se unlawful] represents the trend of legal thought of modern times, and is specifically reflected in the statute above construed.' Ex parte Sweitzer, 13 Okl. Cr. 154, 160, 162 Pac. 1134\n\n\n\n See St. Louis v. Gloner, 210 Mo. 502, 109 S. W. 30, 124 Am. St. Rep. 750.\n A state, which despite the Fourteenth Amendment possesses the power to impose on employers without fault unlimited liability for injuries suffered by employees,47 and to limit the freedom of contract of some employers and not of others,48 surely does not lack the power to select for its citizens that one of conflicting views on boycott by peaceful picketing which its legislature and highest court consider will best meet its conditions and secure the public welfare.\n The supreme Court of Arizona having held as a rule of substantive law that the boycott as here practiced was legal at common law, and that the picketing was peaceful, and hence legal under the statute (whether or not it was legal at common law), necessarily denied the injunction, since, in its opinion, the defendants had committed no legal wrong and were threatening none. But even if this court should hold that an employer has a constitutional right to be free from interference by such a boycott, or that the picketing practiced was not in fact peaceful, it does not follow that Arizona would lack the power to refuse to protect that right by injunction. For it is clear that the refusal of an equitable remedy for a tort is not \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 373]\n\u00a0\n necessarily a denial of due process of law. And it seems to be equally clear that such refusal is not necessarily arbitrary and unreasonable when applied to incidents of the relation of employer and employee. The considerations which show that the refusal is not arbitrary or unreasonable show likewise that such refusal does not necessarily constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws merely because some, or even the same property rights which are excluded by this statute from protection by injunction, receive such protection under other circumstances, or between persons standing in different relations. The acknowledged legislative discretion exerted in classification, so frequently applied in defining rights, extends equally to the grant of remedies. \n49\n It is for the legislature to say-within the broad limits of the discretion which it possesses-whether of not the remedy for a wrong shall be both criminal and civil and whether or not it shall be both at law and in equity.\n A state is free since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it was before, not only to determine what system of law shall prevail in it, but also by what processes legal rights may be asserted, and in what courts they may be enforced. Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, 31; Iowa, \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 374]\n\u00a0\n Central Railway Co. v. Iowa, \n160 U.S. 389\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 344. As a state may adopt or reject trial by jury, Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; or, adopting it, may retain or discard its customary incidents, Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 350; Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 77; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 U.S. 581\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 448, 494. As a state may grant or withhold review of a decision by appeal, Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 U.S. 505\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 390; so it may determine for itself, from time to time, whether the protection which it affords to property rights through its courts shall be given by means of the preventive remedy or exclusively by an action at law for compensation.\n Nor is a state obliged to protect all property rights by injunction merely because it protects some, even if the attending circumstances are in some respects similar. The restraining power of equity might conceivably be applied to every intended violation of a legal right. On grounds of expediency its application is commonly denied in cases where there is a remedy at law which is deemed legally adequate. But an injunction has been denied on grounds of expediency, in many cases where the remedy at law is confessedly not adequate. This occurs whenever a dominant public interest is deemed to require that the preventive remedy, otherwise available for the protection of private rights, be refused and the injured party left to such remedy as courts of law may afford. Thus, courts ordinarily refuse, perhaps in the interest of free speech, to restrain actionable libels. Boston Diatite Co. v. Florence Mfg. Co., 114 Mass. 69, 19 Am. Rep. 310; Prudential Insurance Co. v. Knott, L. R. 10 Ch. App. 142. In the interest of personal liberty they ordinarily refuse to enforce specifically, by mandatory injunction or otherwise, obligations involving personal service. Arthur v. Oakes, 63 Fed. 310, 318, 11 C. C. A. 209, 25 L. R. A. 414; Davis v. Foreman, \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 1894]\n\u00a0\n 3 Ch. 654, 657; Gossard v. Crosby, 132 Iowa, 155, 163, 164, 109 N. W. 483, 6 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1115. In the desire to preserve the separation of governmental powers they have declined to protect by injunction mere political rights, Giles v. \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 375]\n\u00a0\n Harris, \n189 U.S. 475\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 639; and have refused to interfere with the operations of the police department, Davis v. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 75 N. Y. 362; Delaney v. Flood, 183 N. Y. 323, 76 N. E. 209, 2 L. R. A. (N. S.) 678, 111 Am. St. Rep. 759, 5 Ann. Cas. 480. Compare Bisbee v. Arizona Insurance Agency, 14 Ariz. 313, 127 Pac. 722. Instances are numerous where protection to property by way of injunction has been refused solely on the ground that serious public inconvenience would result from restraining the act complained of. Such, for example, was the case where a neighboring landowner sought to restrain a smelter from polluting the air, but that relief, if granted, would have necessitated shutting down the plant, and this would have destroyed the business and impaired the means of livelihood of a large community. \n50\n There are also numerous instances where the circumstances would, according to general equity practice, have justified the issue of an injunction, but it was refused solely because the right sought to be enforced was created by statute, and the courts, applying a familar rule, held that the remedy provided by the statute was exclusive. \n51\n\u00a0\n\n Such limitations upon the use of the injunction for the protection of private rights have ordinarily been imposed in the interest of the public by the court acting in the exercise of its broad discretion. But in some instances, the \n\n[257 U.S. 312, 376]\n\u00a0\n denial of the preventive remedy because of a public interest deemed paramount, has been expressly commanded by statute. Thus the courts of the United States have been prohibited from staying proceedings in any court of a state, Judicial Code,  265 (Comp. St.  1242); and also from enjoining the illegal assessment and collection of taxes, Revised Statutes ,  3224 (Comp. St.  5947); Snyder v. Marks, \n109 U.S. 189\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 157; Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 U.S. 118\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 275. What Congress can do in curtailing the equity power of the federal courts, state Legislatures may do in curtailing equity powers of the state courts, unless prevented by the Constitution of the state. In other words, states are free since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, as they were before, either to expand or to contract their equity jurisdiction. The denial of the more adequate equitable remedy for private wrongs is in essence an exercise of the police power, by which, in the interest of the public and in order to preserve the liberty and the property of the great majority of the citizens of a state, rights of property and the liberty of the individual must be remolded, from time to time, to meet the changing needs of society.\n For these reasons, as well as for others stated by Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice PITNEY, in which I concur, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona should, in my opinion, be affirmed: First, because in permitting damage to be inflicted by means of boycott and peaceful picketing Arizona did not deprive the plaintiff of property without due process of law or deny him equal protection of the laws; and, secondly, because, if Arizona was constitutionally prohibited from adopting this rule of substantive law, it was still free to restrict the extraordinary remedies of equity where it considered their exercise to be detrimental to the public welfare, since such restriction was not a denial to the employer either of due process of law or of equal protection of the laws. \n\nFootnotes\n No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of this state, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case be- \n tween an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving or growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property or to a property right of the party making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney.\n And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at or near a house or place where any person resides or works, or carries on business, or happens to be for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information or of peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute; or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from paying or giving to or withholding from any person engaged in such dispute any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling at any place in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Muller v.

The Royal Commission on Trade Disputes and Trade Combinations, whose recommendations were the basis of the Trade Disputes Act. 1906, 6 Edw.

(2) To declare strikes from whatever motive or for whatever purposes (including sympathetic or secondary strikes), apart from crime or breach of contract, legal. ...' It is probable that sections 1 and 3 of the act of 1906 make the secondary strike or boycott in the course of a trade dispute legal. But see note 14, par. 2. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Trade Disputes Act (1906), 6 Edw. VII, c. 47,  2. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Read v.

In the event of an illegal strike occurring in any industry, the court may order any trade union, whose executive or members are taking part in or aiding or abetting the strike, to pay a penalty not exceeding five hundred pounds.'\n\n The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904,  38(e), provides that the Court of Arbitration and Conciliation shall have power 'to enjoin any organization or person from committing or continuing any contravention of this Act.' \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See note, 15, supra. \n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904-1915,  19-31 (printed as Appendix A to Commonwealth Acts, 1914-1915).

Ct. 72. \n[\nFootnote 25\n] In some jurisdictions the courts seek to localize the conflict by making it illegal to bring in any party beyond those between whom the original dispute arose. Burnham v. Dowd, 217 Mass. 351, 104 N. E. 841, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 778; Booth v. Burgess, 72 N. J. Eq. 181, 65 Atl. 226; Purvis v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, 214 Pa. 348, 63 Atl. 585, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 642, 112 Am. St. Rep. 757, 6 Ann. Cas. 275. In other jurisdictions it is considered that any one having business relations with either party which bear on the matter in controversy has violated his neutrality and is subject to reprisal from the union which is carrying on the struggle.

L. R. 901, for limitations.\n Again, in some states it is unlawful to resort to the method of notifying persons that a strike will occur if a non-union employer or his product is employed, Booth v. Burgess, 72 N. J. Eq. 181, 65 Atl. 226; Gray v. Building Trades Council, 91 Minn. 171, 97 N. W. 663, 63 L. R. A. 753, 103 Am. St. Rep. 447, 1 Ann. Cas. 172; while in other states it is lawful, Cohn & Roth Electric Co. v. Bricklayers, 92 Conn. 161, 167, 101 Atl. 659; Bossert v. Dhuy, 221 N. Y. 342, 117 N. E. 582, Ann.

Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, 44 N. E. 1077, 35 L. R. A. 722, 57 Am. St. Rep. 443. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] The earliest reported cases seem to be People v. Wilzig, 4 N. Y. Cr. R. 403; and People v. Kostka, 4 N. Y. Cr. R. 429, both of which occurred in June, 1886. The leading case of State v. Glidden, 55 Conn. 46, 8 Atl. 890, 3 Am. St. Rep. 23, came the next year. Laidler, however, speaks of an unreported case in 1840. See Laidler, Boycotts and the Labor Struggle, p. 70. See also Commons, History of Labor in the United States, vol. 2, pp. 267, 317, 364. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Some of the difference of opinion results from a difference in definition. A boycott is sometimes defined so as to entail violence or malicious oppression, State v. Glidden, 55 Conn. 46, 8 Atl. 890, 3 Am. St. Rep. 23; while in other cases it is simply pressure exerted by abstention from business relations, Mills v. U. S. Printing Co., 99 App. Div. 605, 91 N. Y. Supp. 185, affirmed 199 N. Y. 76, 92 N. E. 214. The terms primary and secondary, as describing the boycott, are also of uncertain content. Only a boycott that is free of violence or malevolence is anywhere held to be lawful. This peaceful boycott in support of a bona fide industrial conflict, however, is not everywhere held lawful, and its lawfulness often is held to depend on whether it is used against the industrial antagonist directly (primary boycott) or against an outsider because of his influence on or connection with the industrial antagonist (secondary boycott). Holding the boycott, primary and secondary, illegal: Wilson v. Hey, 232 Ill. 389, 83 N. E. 928, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 85, 122 Am. St. Rep. 119, 13 Ann. Cas. 82; Beck v.

AETNA EXPLOSIVES CO(1921)\nNo. 296\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 402, 403]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Hanson for the United States.\n Mr. Addison S. Pratt, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A writ of certiorari to the Court of Customs Appeals was granted (\n253 U.S. 481\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 483) under the Act of August 22, 1914 (chapter 267, 38 Stats. 703 [Comp. St.  1186]). AEtna Explosives Co. v. United States, 9 Ct. Cust. App. 298.\n The question presented is whether the imports came within paragraph 387 of the free list, Tariff Act of 1913 (chapter 16, 38 Stats. 114), which provides:\n'Acids: Acetic or pyroligneous, arsenic or arsenious, carbolic, chromic, fluoric, hydrofluoric, hydrochloric or muriatic, nitric, phosphoric, phthalic, prussic, silicic, sulphuric or oil of vitriol, and valerianic'\n\n -or was dutiable under paragraph 5:\n'Alkalies, alkaloids, and all chemical and medicinal compounds, preparations, mixtures and salts, and combinations thereof not specially provided for in this section, 15 per centum ad valorem.'\n\n The imported merchandise was nitric acid, to which approximately 20 per cent. by weight and 5 per cent. according to value of sulphuric acid had been added for the sole purpose of preventing corrosion of steel tank cars essential for transportation of the former acid in large quantities. That the addition of sulphuric acid prevents nitric acid from attacking steel is a well-known fact concerning which there is no very satisfactory explanation. The court below found the sulphuric acid was added solely for transportation purposes, and that the result was not a mixture merchantable as such for use in the United States. It accordingly held that no duty should have been damanded and among other things said: \n\n[256 U.S. 402, 404]\n\u00a0\n 'The word 'preparations' [in paragraph 5] implies of course that they are something prepared and adapted to particular uses or services. It is no stretch to say that the word 'mixtures' as here employed was used in a similar sense to import mixtures susceptible of commercial use as they exist, or are at least such as are purposely started on their way toward adaption to such use. While not resting this case solely upon this view, it certainly would appeal with great force were it the only consideration involved.'\n'The testimony fairly tends to show that as a commercial proposition there is only one practical means of transporting strong nitric acid such as that involved in the present importation in quantities sufficient to meet the current demand, and that is to mix it with a sufficient amount of sulphuric acid and ship it in tank cars or drums.'\n\n'It is evident that the importer sought to introduce nitric acid and had no desire to import sulphuric acid, or nitric and sulphuric acid as a usable mixture. This small percentage of sulphuric acid which was relatively insignificant in its money value was employed solely for the purpose of making it possible to ship the nitric acid into this country in usable quantities. The result was not a mixture merchantable as such for use in the United States. ... The merchandise had not reached the state of a commercial mixture contemplated by the statute. It was susceptible of no use other than as nitric acid which must before use be again treated. The mixing of this minimum amount of sulphuric acid should be treated as a means of and part of the shipment, and as an act as essential in the importation of nitric acid as would have been the proper packing of glassware or other goods designed for shipment by rail.'\n\n'In the present case we are convinced that there was neither an advantage to the importer in adding the requisite amount of sulphuric acid to admit of safe shipment of the nitric acid nor was there any possible loss of revenue to the \n\n[256 U.S. 402, 405]\n\u00a0\n government. The sole purpose for which this addition was made was to admit of shipment. It would be sticking in the bark to say that this was such a mixture as the statute in question contemplates. It is not yet prepared. It has not been advanced as a preparation for actual use except to the extent that a small portion of the requisite amount of sulphuric acid which when added in the proper quantity would result in making a mixture which was usable, is found in this tank instead of some other. The quantity is relatively insignificant.'\n\n'We think that the true rule is that the introduction of a quantity of sulphuric acid solely for the purpose of rendering the transportation of nitric acid safe, and which does not result in a usable mixture, is more in the nature of an act of shipment than an admixture, and does not produce a substance which is dutiable under paragraph 5.'\n\n We find no reason for disapproving the conclusion reached by the Court of Customs Appeals. The applicable tariff act granted free entry to both nitric and sulphuric acids, and, viewed practically, the commodity in question was nothing more than nitric acid rendered noninjurious to steel tanks by adding sulphuric acid of small value. The two acids do not interact, and the result was a mere mechanical mixture, not intended or adapted as such for commercial use, and not a chemical mixture within the true intent of paragraph 5.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. AMERICAN CHICLE CO(1921)\nNo. 175\nArgued: January 24, 1921Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for the United states. \n\n[256 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles P. Spooner, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMESdelivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant in error, the petitioner below, made a claim against the United States for $6,318.56 paid by it for revenue stamps under the Act of October 22, 1914, c. 331,  5, and Schedule B, 38 Stat. 745, 754, 763, (extended by Resolution of December 17, 1915, c. 4, 39 Stat. 2, through December 31, 1916), which it alleges were unused after January 1, 1916, and therefore were to be redeemed under section 24 of the Act of October 22, 38 Stat. 764, and the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463,  411, 39 Stat. 756, 793 (Comp. St.  6346a), the stamps having been purchased within two years of the application for redemption as required by the latter act. The United States demurred to the petition and the petitioner recovered in the District Court. The question is whether the petition discloses facts upon which it can be said that the goods were not 'removed for sale' within the meaning of section 5, which levies the tax upon the things mentioned in Schedule B 'manufactured, sold, or removed for sale.'\n The petitioner manufactures chewing gum, one of the articles mentioned in Schedule B, and when the product is prepared transports it from the place of preparation, in the language of the petitioner 'to one of its other factories or warehouses, as the state of the stock therein, or the condition of the trade, may demand.' The goods concerned 'had been removed from the factory at which they were manufactured and prepared for sale, to other factories or warehouses of petitioner in other parts of the United States, as hereinbefore set forth.' They had upon them uncancelled revenue stamps, but belonged to the petitioner and were subject to no contract of sale on September 9, 1916, when the above mentioned Act of September 8, 1916, went into effect, \n\n[256 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n providing for the redemption of stamps, as we have said. The petitioner sells only to wholesale dealers, never at retail. By its own statement it must be taken to have removed the goods for the purposes of sale to such places as seemed most likely to offer a market, although no sale had taken place. It is said that upon the language of the petition the greater part of the goods may have been sent to other factories. But it is for the petitioner to state a case and so far as appears, and probably in fact, all the removals had the same end in view.\n We may assume without deciding that the tax is levied in respect of the sale rather than of the manufacture of goods, but that throws little light upon the question of the precise moment when it falls due. The words 'sold or removed for sale' clearly mean that it falls due in some cases before a sale is complete. No one we presume would doubt that if the goods were removed for the purpose of satisfying an outstanding contract for a certain amount of chewing gum, the tax would be due at the moment of the removal although the goods were not yet appropriated to the contract in any binding way. It seems to us hardly more doubful that the same would be true if goods were removed by a manufacturer to put into the window of a retail shop kept by it on the other side of the street. If we are right these examples show that removal for the purpose of forwarding a sale is a removal for sale within the meaning of the Act. But on the face of the petition that was the object of the transfer of these goods to other parts of the United States.\n Notwithstanding the assumption that the tax is levied in respect of sale rather than of manufacture we agree with the Government that the statute contemplates a payment by the manufacturer. This is shown by sections 17-19. By section 20 every manufacturer of any article provided for in Schedule B is required to file a monthly declaration that no such article has been 'removed ... from \n\n[256 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n the premises of such manufacturer ... other than such as have been duly taken account of and charged with the stamp tax,' under a penalty for neglect. This seems to us to confirm the conclusion that we already have indicated. If the petitioner should send a mass of chewing gum from its factory in New Jersey or New York to a more promising market in another State it does not appear to us that it could escape the obligation of section 20 by showing that although the gum unquestionably had left the premises of the manufacturer it was destined to another warehouse that the petitioner also owned. That does not seem to us the natural or the rational meaning of the words used. It is said that the construction of a similar Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448-463, was the same while that was in force, and that presumably the later Act adopted the construction. The argument is another confirmation of the view that we adopt.\n The tax is four cents upon packages of not more than $1 of actual retail value, with 4 cents for each additional dollar, but this rough reference to retail price is far from implying that the package must have been sold in order to fix the tax. It appears to us entirely natural that Congress should look to the original place of manufacture as the place for the identification of the taxable goods and to the moment of leaving it, except in exceptional cases, as the time for the attaching of the tax. It seems to us to have done so in sufficiently unmistakable terms.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CORONADO BEACH CO(1921)\nNo. 524\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 472, 473]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnett, for the United States.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 472, 482]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Peter F. Dunne, of San Francisco, Cal., for Coronado Beach Co.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 472, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases arise out of a proceeding brought by the United States under the Act of July 27, 1917, c. 42, 40 Stat. 247 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1867ddd), for the double purpose of ascertaining the rights of private parties in North Island in the harbor of San Diego, California, and of condemning the whole of said island for public purposes after the value of such rights has been fixed and paid into Court. The proceeding was begun by a bill in equity against the Coronado Beach Company. In its answer that Company alleged title to the whole island, and after a hearing obtained a decree in its favor, subject to the question of the rights of the United States brought up by the appeal in No. 525. The case then was transferred to the law side, the value of the plaintiff's island was assessed by a jury, and a judgment was entered that upon payment of $5,000,000 into Court within thirty days the United States might have a final order of condemnation. The writ of error in 524 presents the questions raised in this stage of the case.\n The title of the Coronado Beach Company is derived from a Mexican grant of May 15, 1846, to one Carillo, a Mexican citizen, the Company having succeeded to his rights. At this point it is necessary to mention only that Carillo is given the right to enclose the land 'without prejudice to the crossings, roads, and servitudes.' The grant was under a law of August 18, 1824, by the fifth \n\n[255 U.S. 472, 486]\n\u00a0\n section of which--\n'If, for the defence or security of the nation, the Federal Government should find it expedient to make use of any portion of these lands for the purpose of constructing warehouses, arsenals, or other public edifices, it may do so, with the approbation of the General Congress, or during its recess with that of the Government Council.' Hall, Laws of Mexico, 148,  492.\n\n The United States interprets this as a reservation of power against all persons, as one of the servitudes to which the Carillo grant was subject, and as a sovereign right to which it succeeded when the land became territory of the United States. We cannot accept so broad an interpretation. We need not repeat the discussion in Arguello v. United States, 18 How. 539, wherein it was laid down that the first eight sections apply wholly to colonists and foreigners. The decision immediately concerned the fourth section of the law, but the ground for the construction given to it was that the others obviously were limited as stated and that there was no reason for giving to the fourth a greater scope. Moreover the second section states that--\n'The objects of this law are those national lands which are neither private property nor belong to any corporation or pueblo and can therefore be colonized.' United States v. Yorba, 1 Wall. 412.\n\n It is hardly credible that section five should have been intended to reserve the right to displace private owners, and wholly incredible that it reserves the right to do so without compensation, especially when it is noticed that by the law of April 6, 1830, the value of lands taken for fortification, &c., is to be credited to the States. Camou v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 277, 284\n, 285 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 855; Hall, Laws of Mexico, 108,  291.\n The more serious questions arise on the writ of error and concern primarily the extent of the grant; the main dispute being whether the Company owns the tide lands in front of the upland of the island. Carillo's petition states as its ground that he is in want of proper land for the breeding of \n\n[255 U.S. 472, 487]\n\u00a0\n cattle and horses and asks the grant for a cattle farm of the island or peninsula in question, bounded substantially as in the subsequent grant, viz.: on the north by the Estero of San Diego towards the town, east by the end of the rancho of Don Augustin Meliso, south by the sea, and west by the bay or anchorage for ships, as explained by the map which goes with the espediente. On April 20, 1852, Billings and others then holding the title petitioned the Commissioners to settle Private Land Claims, appointed under the Act of March 3, 1851, c. 41; 9 Stat. 631, to confirm to them this tract of land. The petition was rejected by the Board but on appeal the title was declared good and confirmed by the District Court of the United States. The decree stated the boundaries on the north, east and south as in the original grant, and 'west by the anchorage for ships according to the documents of title and map to which reference is had.' This decree was filed on January 12, 1857; on May 7, 1867, after an appeal to this Court had been dismissed, there was a substitution of Peachy and Aspenwall as parties, and on June 11, 1869, a patent was issued reciting the decree, a return with a plat of a survey approved under section 13 of the Act of 1851, and giving and granting to them the land described in the survey. The Mexican map is not in the record and is not material since the plat accompanying the patent of the United States shows the line marking the 'Anchorage for Ships,' which includes the tide lands in dispute.\n The jurisdiction of the decree and the validity of the patent so far as they cover the tide lands is denied by the United States, a special reason being found in the fact that California became a State in 1850 and thereby acquired a title to the submerged lands before the date of the decree. But the title of the State was subject to prior Mexican grants. The question whether there was such a prior grant and what were its boundaries were questions that had to be decided in the proceedings for confirmation and there was \n\n[255 U.S. 472, 488]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to decide them as well if the decision was wrong as if it was right. The title of California was in abeyance until those issues were determined, as the decree related back to the date of the original grant. The petitioner asked a confirmation of the tract conveyed to Carillo. The grant to Carillo was bounded 'west by the anchorage for ships' and although it well may be that in view of the purpose set out in his petition and the circumstances the grant could have been construed more narrowly, that was a matter to be passed upon and when the decree and the patent went in favor of the grantee it is too late to argue that they are not conclusive against the United States. It is said that the field notes, not put in evidence at the trial, show that the deep water line was not surveyed, but was taken from the Coast Survey maps. But however arrived at it was adopted by the United States for its grant and it cannot now be collaterally impeached. Knight v. United Land Association, \n142 U.S. 161\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 258; San Francisco v. Le Roy, \n138 U.S. 656\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 364; Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478. It was suggested that the bill might be regarded as a direct attack upon the patent; but this probably was an afterthought and in any event the attack would be too late. Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,  8; 26 Stat. 1099 ( Comp. St.  5114); United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n209 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 579.\n A subordinate objection is urged to the admission of maps or drawings showing the adaptability of the island to a great system of improvements possible if the Coronado Beach Company owned the submerged land. It is urged that such improvements were speculative, remote, and not shown to be commercially practicable. But the drawings were admitted only to illustrate the opinion of the witness as to value and were explained as meaning no more. If the reasons for his opinion were inadequate they detracted from the weight of his testimony but were not inadmissible on that account. \n\n[255 U.S. 472, 489]\n\u00a0\n Finally it is contended that the Government took only the upland. But the Act of 1917 provides for the taking of 'the whole of North Island' and for 'the determination and appraisement of any rights private parties may have in said island,' and the bill follows the act and prays that if the defendant company has any right to the tract or any part thereof the right 'and the whole thereof' may be 'appraised and condemned.' We discover no error in the proceedings below.\n Decree and judgment affirmed\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Wilson, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims sustaining a claim for refund of an estate tax exacted under title 2 of Revenue Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/2 a-6336 1\/2 m), as amended by Act March 3, 1917, c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000, 1002. It presents the question whether the act taxed a certain interest that passed under testamentary execution of a general power of appointment created prior, but executed subsequent, to its passage.\n The facts are as follows: Joseph N. Field, a citizen and resident of Illinois, died April 29, 1914, leaving a will which was duly admitted to probate in that state, and by which he gave the residue of his estate, after payment of certain \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n legacies, to trustees, with provision that one-third of it should be set apart and held as a separate trust fund for the benefit of his wife, Kate Field, the net income to be paid to her during life, and from and after her death the net income of onehalf of said share of the trust estate to be paid to such persons and in such shares as she should appoint by last will and testament. The trust was to continue until the death of the last surviving grandchild of the testator who was living at the time of his death, and at its termination the undistributed estate was to be divided among named beneficiaries or their issue, per stirpes, in proportions specified. Kate Field died April 29, 1917, a resident of Illinois, leaving a will which was duly probated in that state, by which she executed the power of appointment, directing that the income to which the power related should be paid in equal shares to her children surviving at the date of the respective payments, the issue of any deceased child to stand in the place of such deceased child. The collector of internal revenue, assuming to act under the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended, and regulations issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, included as a part of the gross estate of Kate Field the appointed estate passing under her execution of the power, and proceeded to assess and collect an estate tax based upon the net value thereof, and amounting to $121,059.60. Her executor, having paid the tax under protest, and having made a claim for refund which was considered and rejected by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, brought this suit and recovered judgment, from which the United States appeals.\n The Revenue Act of 1916, in section 201 (39 Stat. 777), imposes a tax equal to specified percentages of the value of the net estate 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this act.' By section 203 (page 778) the value of the net estate is to be determined by subtracting from the value of the gross estate certain \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n specified deductions. The gross estate is to be valued as follows:\n'Sec. 202. That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated:\n\n'(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration and is subject to distribution as part of his estate.\n\n'(b) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title. ...'\n\n The amendment of March 3, 1917 (39 Stat. 1002), pertains merely to the rates, and need not be further considered. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The provision quoted from section 202 was construed by the Treasury Department, in U. S. Internal Revenue Regulations No. 37, relating to Estate Taxes, Revised May, 1917, art. XI, as follows:\n'Property passing under a general power of appointment is to be included as a portion of the gross estate of a decedent appointor.'\n\n No question being suggested as to the power of Congress \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n to impose a tax upon the passing of property under testamentary execution of a power of appointment created before, but executed after, the passage of the taxing act (see Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466, 473\n, 478 S., 479, 27 Sup. Ct. 550; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 56-61, 20 Sup. Ct. 747), the case involves merely a question of the construction of the act. Applying the accepted canon that the provisions of such acts are not to be extended by implication (Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 53), we are constrained to the view-notwithstanding the administrative construction adopted by the Treasury Department-that the Revenue Act of 1916 did not impose an estate tax upon property passing under a testamentary execution of a general power of appointment.\n The government seeks to sustain the tax under both clauses above quoted from section 202.\n The conditions expressed in clause (a) are to the effect that the taxable estate must be (1) an interest of the decedent at the time of his death, (2) which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration, and (3) is subject to distribution as part of his estate. These conditions are expressed conjunctively; and it would be inadmissible, in construing a taxing act, to read them as if prescribed disjunctively. Hence, unless the appointed interest fulfilled all three conditions, it was not taxable under this clause.\n The chief reliance of the government is upon the rule, well established in England and followed generally, but not universally, in this country, that where one has a general power of appointment either by deed or by will, and executes the power, equity will regard the property appointed as part of his assets for the payment of his creditors in preference to the claims of his voluntary appointees. See Brandies v. Cochrane, \n112 \nU.S. 344, 352\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 194. \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n The English cases are fully reviewed by the House of Lords in O'Grady v. Wilmot, \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 1916]\n\u00a0\n 2 A. C. 231, 246, et seq. Illustrative cases in the American courts are Johnson v. Cushing, 15 N. H. 298, 307, 41 Am. Dec. 694; Rogers v. Hinton, 62 N. C. 101, 105; Clapp v. Ingraham, 126 Mass. 200, 202; Knowles v. Dodge, 1 Mackey (D. C.) 66, 72; Freeman's Adm'r v. Butters, 94 Va. 406, 411, 26 S. E. 845; Tallmadge v. Sill, 21 Barb. (N. Y.) 34, 51, et seq.; contra, per Gibson, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Duffield, 12 Pa. 277, 279-281; Pearce v. Lederer (D. C.) 262 Fed. 993, affirmed Lederer v. Pearce (C. C. A.) 266 Fed. 497.\n It is tacitly admitted that the rule obtains in Illinois, and we shall so assume.\n But the existence of the power does not of itself vest any estate in the donee. Collins v. Wickwire, 162 Mass. 143, 144, 38 N. E. 365; Keays v. Blinn, 234 Ill. 121, 124, 84 N. E. 628, 14 Ann. Cas. 37; Walker v. Treasurer, etc., 221 Mass. 600, 602, 603, 109 N. E. 647; Shattuck v. Burrage, 229 Mass. 448, 451, 118 N. E. 889. See Carver v. Jackson, 4 Pet. 1, 93.\n Where the donee dies indebted, having executed the power in favor of volunteers, the appointed property is treated as equitable, not legal assets of his estate (Clapp v. Ingraham, 126 Mass. 200, 203; Patterson Co. v. Lawrence, 83 Ga. 703, 707, 10 S. E. 355, 7 L. R. A. 143), and (in the absence of statute), if it passes to the executor at all, it does so, not by virtue of his office, but as a matter of convenience, and because he represents the rights of creditors (O'grady v. Wilmot, \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 1916]\n\u00a0\n 2 A. C. 231, 248-257; Smith v. Garey, 22 N. C. 42, 49; Olney v. Balch, 154 Mass. 318, 322, 28 N. E. 258; Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Mass. 410, 411, 50 N. E. 1033; Hill v. Treasurer, etc., 229 Mass. 474, 477, 118 N. E. 891, L. R. A. 1918D, 337).\n Where the power is executed, creditors of the donee can lay claim to the appointed estate only to the extent that the donee's own estate is insufficient to satisfy their demands. Patterson Co. v. Lawrence, 83 Ga. 703, 708, 10 S. E. 355, 7 L. R. A. 143; \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n Walker v. Treasurer, etc., 221 Mass. 600, 602, 603, 109 N. E. 647; Shattuck v. Burrage, 229 Mass. 448, 452, 118 N. E. 889.\n It is settled that (in the absence of statute) creditors have no redress in case of a failure to execute the power. Holmes v. Coghill, 7 Ves. 499, 507, affirmed 12 Ves. 206, 214-215; Gilman v. Bell. 99 Ill. 144, 150; Duncanson v. Manson, 3 App. D. C. 260, 273.\n And, whether the power be or be not exercised, the property that was subject to appointment is not subject to distribution as part of the estate of the donee. If there be no appointment, it goes according to the disposition of the donor. If there be an appointment to volunteers, then, subject to whatever charge creditors may have against it, it goes not to the next of kin or the legatees of the donee, but to his appointees under the power.\n It follows that the interest in question, not having been property of Mrs. Field at the time of her death, nor subject to distribution as part of her estate, was not taxable under clause (a).\n We deem it equally clear that it was not within clause (b). That clause is the complement of (a), and is aptly descriptive of a transfer of an interest in decedent's own property in his lifetime, intended to take effect at or after his death. It cannot, without undue laxity of construction, be made to cover a transfer resulting from a testamentary execution by decedent of a power of appointment over property not his own.\n It would have been easy for Congress to express a purpose to tax property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by a decedent had such a purpose existed; and none was expressed in the act under consideration. In that of February 24, 1919, which took its place, the section providing how the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined contains a clause precisely to the point (section 402 [ e], 40 Stat. 1097):\n'To the extent of any property passing under a general power of \n\n[255 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or (2) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his death, except,' etc.\n\n Its insertion indicates that Congress at least was doubtful whether the previous Act included property passing by appointment. See Matter of Miller, 110 N. Y. 216, 222, 18 N. E. 139; Matter of Harbeck, 161 N. Y. 211, 217, 218, 55 N. E. 850; United States v. Bashaw, 50 Fed. 749, 754, 1 C. C. A. 653. The government contends that the amendment was made for the purpose of clarifying rather than extending the law as it stood, and cites a statement to that effect in the Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means (House Doc. No. 1267, p. 101, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.). It is evident, however, that this statement was based upon the interpretation of the act of 1916 adopted by the Treasury Department. The same report proceeded to declare (page 102) that 'the absence of a provision including property transferred by power of appointment makes it possible, by resorting to the creation of such a power, to effect two transfers of an estate with the payment of only one tax'; and this, together with the fact that the committee proposed that the law be amended, shows that the Treasury construction was not treated as a safe reliance.\n The tax in question being unsupported by the taxing act, the Court of Claims was right in awarding reimbursement.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act was further amended October 3, 1917 (chapter 63, 40 Stat. 300, 324); superseded and repealed by act of February 24, 1919 (chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1149). \n\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Ed. --, just decided, and was argued and submitted at the same time.\n In this instance the government and the landowner appealed from the award of the commissioners, and the case was tried to a jury. Jurors were instructed that the allowance of interest was a matter of law, and in a form \n\n[255 U.S. 170, 171]\n\u00a0\n of verdict given to them interest at 6 per cent. was to be added from April 19, 1912, the date of appropriation.\n It appears that by agreement a separate order requiring the deposit of interest was entered in order to allow a writ of error upon that point, and in connection with the above form of verdict the jurors were instructed to assess compensation as of the value of the land on April 19, 1912, and not to add interest from that time to the date of the verdict. Afterwards a final judgment was entered in the District Court requiring a deposit of the amount of the verdict, and a separate order was made directing payment of interest from April 19, 1912.

Sacks, \n257 U.S. 37\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 38, 66 L. Ed. --. It as decided in the District Court at the same time as the Sacks Case and upon the same opinion, the legal propositions being the same in both cases. They were presented upon demurrers to the indictments.\n The indictment in the present case is in two counts, the first charging a violation of section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201 ), and the second charging a conspiracy under section 37 to violate section 148 (section 10318). The basis of both is a conspiracy to defraud the United States by the violation of the Act of Congress of September 24, 1917, passed on in United States v. Sacks. The ways and means of the execution of the conspiracy are described with much detail by a recitation of the Acts of Congress of September 24, 1917, and September 24, 1918 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6829l), and the provisions of the circulars issued by the Secretary of the Treasury providing for the execution of the purpose of those acts. And specifically, it is averred that the defendants \n\n[257 U.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n in the case, defendants in error here, purchased from persons not authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the same, a quantity of war savings certificates of the series of 1918 and 1919, with savings certificate stamps affixed thereto, and that the defendants well knew that the certificates and the stamps were not transferable, were worthless in their hands, and could not be redeemed by them at or prior to maturity dates thereof, and were not payable to any one save one who had purchased them from an authorized agent of the United States, and to a person whose name was written on them at the time of issue and purchase, but conspired to obtain them for themselves from the United States prior to the maturity date of the certificates and stamps knowing that they were not entitled thereto and that the United States was not obligated to pay them, and thereby defraud the United States.\n The defendants as part of their conspiracy, is the further averment, conspired to obtain in a manner contrary to the provisions of the act of Congress to the effect that the amount of certificates sold to any one person at any one time should not exceed $100, a number of blank certificates of a maturity value in excess of $100, to which stamps had not been affixed and on which the name of the owner had not been written, to detach from the certificates so purchased, the stamps, and to affix the stamps to blank certificates and to write upon them the name of some person, other than any one of the defendants, and to present them at a post office of the United States for payment.\n To effect the object of the conspiracy it is averred that the defendant Janowitz, at the Southern district of New York, maintained during the months of August and September, 1919, an office for the purpose of purchasing certificates and stamps, and that in the manner described, the defendants at the times and places set forth conspired \n\n[257 U.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n to defraud the United States, and one of them did an 'act to effect the object of the conspiracy against the peace of the United States, and their dignity contrary to the form of the statute of the United States in such case made and provided.' Section 37, U. S. C. C.\n The second count, with about the same detail of circumstances as contained in the first count, charges that the defendants at a particuar time conspired to commit an offense against the United States in that they conspired to alter with intent to defraud, obligations of the United States; that is, the war savings certificates of the United States issued under the Act of September 24, 1917, with war savings certificate stamps affixed thereto.\n It is difficult to succinctly represent the contentions of defendants. Their basic proposition seems to be that the certificates and war stamps were lawfully purchased from the Secretary of the Treasury and became the property of the purchaser and that, therefore, in the absence of an express statutory enactment, the right of the purchaser to alienate or sell them and of the defendants in error to acquire them was absolute and could not be made unlawful by a mere executive regulation. Or to put it another way, as counsel puts it 'that the exchange, sale or barter of war savings stamps is a perfectly lawful business under the strictest letter of the enabling statute.' The deduction, therefore, is that the Secretary of the Treasury had not power conferred upon him to issue the circulars and prescribe the conditions indorsed upon the certificates, and their violation was no crime but was the exercise of a property right.\n This is the ultimate deduction and emphasis of defendants in error's argument. It is not contended that Congress could not have prescribed such limitation but it is contended Congress did not do so nor authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to do so and that, therefore, his regulations are void. They write, it is asserted, 'an entirely \n\n[257 U.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n new law-a law which would hinder and obstruct persons from the exercise of the valuable property right which such persons have exercised in the full belief of its propriety for some years past.'\n These contentions prevailed with Judge Hough in the District Court. He said:\n'When Congress authorized the issuance of 'stamps to evidence payments for or on account of such certificates' and did not deny to the stamp holders the right of transfer, such right existed. The Treasury has sought to take it away by making the certificates nontransferable. Assuming that power exists to prohibit transfer of the certificates, I am wholly unable to perceive that there is any congressional authority for the Secretary's prohibiting the transferability of the stamps affixed to the certificates.\n\n'Nowhere is it said that any particular stamp shall evidence a payment on any particular certificate.\n\n'This I think is the gist of the matter: Is a regulation which as interpreted, in terms, takes away a property right in a manner not specifically authorized by statute, a valid rule? I cannot persuade myself that such is the case'\n\n -and after citing United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 480, and other cases, and attempting to confine them to mere 'procedural regulation' he said:\n'A stamp is a thing of value, bought and paid for, and to deprive it of the quality of assignability is a diminution of lawfully existing property rights, for which in my judgment, congressional action alone will suffice.'\n\n The act of Congress has broader meaning than that assigned to it by the District Court as we expressed in the Sacks Case, and there decided that the Secretary had the power which he exercised.\n The reasoning of the opinion in that case applies in this, and determines the reversal of the Judgment of the District Court. In other words, determines that the facts stated in the counts are sufficient to constitute crimes \n\n[257 U.S. 42, 47]\n\u00a0\n under sections 37 and 148 of the Criminal Code and the Act of Congress of September 24, 1917, properly construed.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Ewing, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered th opinion of the Court.\n April 14, 1919, the Court of Claims rendered a judgment against the United States in favor of L. P. & J. A. Smith (appellees and we shall so refer to them) for the sum of $119,304.27. To review that judgment this appeal is prosecuted.\n The appellees were a partnership doing business at the times herein stated under the firm name of L. P. & J. A. Smith.\n In response to an advertisement and after the submission of proposals for work at the mouth of the Detroit river, a contract in writing was entered into December 31, 1892, by O. M. Poe, Colonel, Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, and appellees, by which the latter agreed to excavate a ship channel 20 and 21 feet deep, located in section 8 of the Detroit river, in accordance with specifications attached to the contract and made a part thereof. They were to receive in full compensation for their work the sum of 18 cents per cubic yard of excavation, scow measure.\n The material to be removed was specified to consist 'of sand, gravel, and boulders, all in unknown quantities.'\n In the season of 1894 there was discovered a natural bed of limestone rock within the boundaries of the excavation called for by the contract, which was not provided for by the contract. For the removal of this limestone the United States advertised for bids. \n\n[256 U.S. 11, 15]\n\u00a0\n The L. P. & J. A. Smith Company, a corporation of Ohio, and a successor in interest to L. P. & J. A. Smith, bid on the work. The bid was accepted and a contract was entered into November 9, 1894, by which that company agreed to remove the rock and other material at the price of $2.24 per cubic yard of excavation, bank measure. The contract was completed on or about June 16, 1895\n\n\n The contract of December 31, 1892, was extended from time to time by Col. Lydecker, the engineer in charge of the work, he having succeeded Colonel Poe, to July 1, 1897. In that year he ordered appellees to work at particular spots toward the northerly end of section 8, at certain designated shoals which had been excavated under the contract of November 9, 1894, with the L. P. & J. A. Smith Company.\n And certain other officers, one an assistant engineer, another a subinspector, in charge of the work, insisted upon locating for appellees the points where dreding was to be done. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The material or a large part of the material to be removed from those points was limestone rock or limestone bed rock. Appellees protested and asked for the fixing of an extra price for doing the work. This was refused and they were told that if they did not remove the same they would be declared defaulting contractors; that the work would be taken from them, done and charged to them, and be paid for from the retained percentages for work already performed, and if the percentages were not sufficient for that purpose they, appellees, and their bondsmen, would be proceeded against. No other officer or officers so told appellees or insisted that all the material to be removed was clay, gravel and boundlers. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A large part of the material arbitrarily stated to be clay, gravel, sand and boundlers, was in fact limestone \n\n[256 U.S. 11, 16]\n\u00a0\n rock and limestone bed rock, and was not the material specified in the contract.\n The quantity of material excavated as thus required, and that required by the contract, the findings estimate in detail and the cost of its excavation, in the sum of $116,760.61, from which was deducted the sum of $5,174.64 that had been paid appellees, leaving due to them $111,585.97. It is found besides that delays caused by the engineer in charge resulted in a loss to the appellees of $7,718.30. For these two sums judgment was rendered.\n The Court of Claims in a brief memorandum summarized the elements of liability against the United States, concluding as follows:\n'We think the right of plaintiffs [the appellees] to recover the price for the work done by them is indisputable.'\n\n The United States adduces against the conclusion certain provisions of the specifications, the latter being, as we have seen, part of the contract.\n They are too long to quote or even summarize. They are to the effect that the decision of the engineer officer in charge as to quality and quantity of work was final and that his instructions were required to be observed by the contractor. And further that modifications of the work in character and quality, whether of labor or material, were to be agreed to in writing and unless so agreed to or expressly required in writing no claim should be made therefor.\n The contention overlooks the view of the contract entertained by Colonel Lydecker and the uselessness of soliciting or expecting any change by him. His conduct, to use counsel's description, 'though perhaps without malice or bad faith in the tortious sense,' was repellant of appeal or of any alternative but submission with its consequences. And we think, against he explicit declaration of the contract of the material to be excavated and its price. The contract provided, in response to advertisements \n\n[256 U.S. 11, 17]\n\u00a0\n and in fulfillment of bids, for the excavation of a ship channel 20 and 21 feet deep and that 'the material to be removed consists of clay, sand, gravel, and boulders, all in unknown proportions.' To these explicit provisions, and their contractual force we may add the judgment and conduct of Colonel Poe, the first engineer officer in charge of the work. He realized immediately when a bed of limestone rock was encountered it was not the material stated in the contract and without hesitation entered into another contract concerning it, and at a price of significant contrast-18 cents per cubic yard, scow measure, being the price of the first contract, $2.24 per cubic yard of excavation, bank measure, being the price of the second contract.\n We think the case is within the principle of Hollerback v. United States, \n233 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 553, Christie v. United States, \n237 U.S. 234\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 565, United States v. Spearin, \n248 U.S. 132\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 59, and United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 U.S. 1\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 423.\n We concur, therefore, with the declaration of the Court of Claims that 'the right' of the appellees 'to recover the price for the work done by them is indisputable,' including the loss to them while waiting for the engineer 'to locate their work.'\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Additional finding upon the mandate of this court. \n\n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., received by him as a dividend upon his 250 shares of stock of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Company, a New Jersey corporation. The United States appeals.\n From the findings of the Court of Claims, read in connection with claimant's petition, the following essential facts appear: In and prior to September, 1915, the New Jersey company had been engaged for many years in the business of manufacturing and selling explosives. Its \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n funded debt and its capital stock at par values were as follows:\n 5% mortgage bonds $ 1,230,000 4 1\/2% 30-year bonds 14,166,000 Preferred stock ($100 shares) 16,068,600 Common stock ($100 shares) 29,427,100 ___\n Total $60,891,700\n It had an excess of assets over liabilities showing a large surplus of accumulated profits; the precise amount is not important, except that it should be stated that it was sufficient to cover the dividend distribution presently to be mentioned. In that month a reorganization and financial adjustment of the business was resolved upon and carried into effect with the assent of a sufficient proportion of the stockholders, in which a new corporation was formed under the laws of Delaware with an authorized capital stock of $240,000,000, to consist in part of debenture stock bearing 6 per cent. cumulative dividends, in part of common stock, and to this new corporation all the assets and good will of the New Jersey company were transferred as an entirety and as a going concern, as of October 1, 1915, at a valuation of $120,000,000; the new company assuming all the obligations of the old except its capital stock and funded debt. In payment of the consideration, the old company retained $1,484,100 in cash to be used in redemption of its outstanding 5 per cent. Mortgage bonds, and received $59,661,700 par value in debenture stock of the new company (of which $30,234,600 was to be used in taking up, share for share and dollar for dollar, the preferred stock of the old company and redeeming its 30-year bonds), and $58,854,200 par value of the common stock of the new company, which was to be and was immediately distributed among the common stockholders of the old company as a dividend, paying them two shares of the new stock for each share they held \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n in the old company. This plan was carried out by appropriate corporate action; the new company took over all the assets of the old company, and that company, besides paying off its 5 per cent. bonds, acquired debenture stock of the new company sufficient to liquidate its 4 1\/2 per cent. 30- year bonds and retire its preferred stock, additional debenture stock equal in amount at par to its own outstanding common stock, and also two shares of common stock of the Delaware corporation for each share of the outstanding common stock of the New Jersey corporation. Each holder of the New Jersey company's common stock (including claimant), retained his old stock and besides received a dividend of two shares for one in common stock of the Delaware company, and the New Jersey corporation retained in its treasury 6 per cent. debenture stock of the Delaware corporation equivalent to the par value of its own outstanding common stock. The personnel of the stockholders and officers of the two corporations was on October 1, 1915, identical, the new company having elected the same officers as the old; and the holders of common stock in both corporations had the same proportionate stockholding in each. After the reorganization and the distribution of the stock of the Delaware corporation, the New Jersey corporation continued as a going concern, and still exists, but except for the redemption of its outstanding bonds, the exchange of debenture stock for its preferred stock, and a holding of debenture stock to an amount equivalent to its own outstanding common and the collection and disposition of dividends thereon, it has done no business. It is not, however, in process of liquidation. It has received as income upon the Delaware company's debenture stock held by it dividends to the amount of 6 per cent. per annum, which it has paid out to its own stockholders including the claimant. The fair market value of the stock of the New Jersey corporation on September 30, 1915, prior to the reorganization, was $ 795 \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n per share, and its fair market value, after the execution of the contracts between the two corporations, was on October 1, 1915, $100 per share. The fair market value of the stock of the Delaware corporation distributed as aforesaid was on October 1, 1915, $347.50 per share. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that the 500 shares of Delaware company stock acquired by claimant in the distribution was income of the value of $347. 50 per share and assessed the additional tax accordingly.\n The Court of Claims, observing that from the facts as found claimant's 250 shares of stock in the New Jersey corporation were worth on the market, prior to the transfer and dividend, precisely the same that the same shares plus the Delaware company's shares received by him were worth thereafter, and that he did not gain any increase in the value of his aggregate holdings by the operation, held that the whole transaction was to be regarded as merely a financial reorganization of the business of the company, producing to him no profit and hence no income, and that the distribution was in effect a stock dividend nontaxable as income under the authority of Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, and not within the rule of Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 U.S. 347\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 546\n\n\n We recognize the importance of regarding matters of substance and disregarding forms in applying the provisions of the Sixteenth Amendment and income tax laws enacted thereunder. In a number of cases besides those just cited we have under varying conditions followed the rule. Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 U.S. 221\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 537; Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 330\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 540; Gulf Oil Corporation v. Lewellyn, \n248 U.S. 71\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 35.\n The act under which the tax now in question was imposed (Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, 167), declares that income shall include, among other things, gains derived 'from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any lawful business carried \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 169]\n\u00a0\n on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.' Disregarding the slight looseness of construction, we interpret 'gains profits, and income derived from ... dividends,' etc., as meaning, not that everything in the form of a dividend must be treated as income, but that income derived in the way of dividends shall be taxed. Hence the inquiry must be whether the shares of stock in the new company received by claimant as a dividend by reason of his ownership of stock in the old company constituted (to apply the tests laid down in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570), a gain derived from capital, not a gain accruing to capital, nor a growth or increment of value in the investment, but a gain, a profit, something of exchangeable value proceeding from the property, severed from the capital however invested, and coming in, that is, received or drawn by the claimant for his separate use, benefit, and disposal.\n Claimant's capital investment was represented by his New Jersey shares. Whatever increment of value had accrued to them prior to September 30, 1915, by reason of the surplus profits that theretofore had been accumulated by the company, was still a part of claimant's capital, from which as yet he had derived no actual and therefore no taxable income so far as the surplus remained undistributed. As yet he had no right to withdraw it or any part of it, could not have such right until action by the company or its proper representatives, and his interest still was but the general property interest of a stockholder in the entire assets, business, and affairs of the company-a capital interest, as we declared in Eisner v. Macomber, supra, \n252 U.S. 208\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570.\n Upon the face of things, however, the transfer of the old company's assets to the new company in exchange for the securities issued by the latter, and the distribution of those securities by the old company among its stockholders, \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 170]\n\u00a0\n changed the former situation materially. The common stock of the new company, after its transfer to the old company and prior to its distribution, constituted assets of the old company which it now held to represent its surplus of accumulated profits-still, however, a common fund in which the individual stockholders of the old company had no separate interest. But when this common stock was distributed among the common stockholders of the old company as a dividend, then at once-unless the two companies must be regarded as substantially identical-the individual stockholders of the old company, including claimant, received assets of exchangeable and actual value severed from their capital interest in the old company, proceeding from it as the result of a division of former corporate profits, and drawn by them severally for their individual and separate use and benefit. Such a gain resulting from their ownership of stock in the old company and proceeding from it constituted individual income in the proper sense.\n That a comparison of the market value of claimant's shares in the New Jersey corporation immediately before with the aggregate market value of those shares plus the dividend shares immediately after the dividend showed no change in the aggregate-a fact relied upon by the Court of Claims as demonstrating that claimant neither gained nor lost pecuniarily in the transaction-seems to us a circumstance of no particular importance in the present inquiry. Assuming the market values were a precise reflex of intrinsic values, they would show merely that claimant acquired no increase in aggregate wealth through the mere effect of the reorganization and consequent dividend, not that the dividend did not constitute income. There would remain the presumption that the value of the New Jersey shares immediately prior to the transaction reflected the original capital investment plus the accretions which had resulted through the company's \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 171]\n\u00a0\n business activities and constituted its surplus; a surplus in which until dividend made the individual stockholder had no property interest except as it increased the valuation of his capital. It is the appropriate function of a dividend to convert a part of a surplus thus accumulated from property of the company into property of the individual stockholders; the stockholder's share being thereby released to and drawn by him as profits or income derived from the company. That the distrubution reduces the intrinsic capital value of the shares by an equal amount is a normal and necessary effect of all dividend distributions-whether large or small and whether paid in money or in other divisible assets-but such reduction constitutes the dividend none the less income derived by the stockholder if it represents gains previously acquired by the corporation. Hence a comparison of aggregate values immediately before with those immediately after the dividend is not a proper test for determining whether individual income, taxable against the stockholder, has been received by means of the dividend.\n The possibility of occasional instances of apparent hardship in the incidence of the tax may be conceded. Where, as in this case, the dividend constitutes a distribution of profits accumulated during an extended period and bears a large proportion to the par value of the stock, if an investor happened to buy stock shortly before the dividend, paying a price enhanced by an estimate of the capital plus the surplus of the company, and after distribution of the surplus, with corresponding reduction in the intrinsic and market value of the shares, he was called upon to pay a tax upon the dividend received, it might look in his case like a tax upon his capital. But it is only apparently so. In buying at a price that reflected the accumulated profits, he of course acquired as a part of the valuable rights purchased the prospect of a dividend from the accumulations-bought 'dividend on,' as the phrase \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 172]\n\u00a0\n goes-and necessarily took subject to the burden of the income tax proper to be assessed against him by reason of the dividend if and when made. He simply stepped into the shoes, in this as in other respects, of the stockholder whose shares he acquired, and presumably the prospect of a dividend influenced the price paid, and was discounted by the prospect of an income tax to be paid thereon. In short, the question whether a dividend made out of company profits constitutes income of the stockholder is not affected by antecedent transfers of the stock from hand to hand.\n There is more force in the suggestion that, looking through and through the entire transaction out of which the distribution came, it was but a financial reorganization of the business as it stood before, without diminution of the aggregate assets or change in the general corporate objects and purposes, without change of personnel either in officers or stockholders, or change in the proportionate interest of any individual stockholder. The argument, in effect, is that there was no loss of essential identity on the part of the company, only a change of the legal habilaments in which the aggregate corporate interests were clothed; no substantial realization by individual stockholders out of the previous accumulation of corporate profits, merely a distribution of additional certificates indicating an increase in the value of their capital holdings. This brings into view the general effect of the combined action of the entire body of stockholders as a mass.\n In such matters, what was done, rather than the design and purpose of the participants, should be the test. However, in this case there is no difference. The proposed plan was set out in a written communication from the president of the New Jersey corporation to the stockholders, a written assent signed by about 90 per cent. of the stockholders, a written agreement made between the old company and the new, and a bill of sale made by the former \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 173]\n\u00a0\n to the latter, all of which are in the findings. The plan as thus proposed and adopted, and as carried out, involved the formation of a new corporation to take over the business and the business assets of the old; it was to be and was formed under the laws of a different state, which necessarily imports a different measure of responsibility to the public, and presumably different rights between stockholders and company and between stockholders inter sese, than before. The articles of association of neither company is made to appear, but in favor of the asserted identity between the companies we will assume (contrary to the probabilities) that there was no significant difference here. But the new company was to have authorized capital stock aggregating $240,000,000- nearly four times the aggregate stock issues and funded debt of the old company-of which less than one-half ($118,515,900) was to be issued presently to the old company or its stockholders, leaving the future disposition of a majority of the authorized new issues still to be determined. There was no present change of officers or stockholders, but manifestly a continuation of identity in this respect depended upon continued unanimous consent or concurrent action of a multitude of individual stockholders actuated by motives and influences necessarily to some extent divergent. In the light of all this we cannot regard the new company as virtually identical with the old, but must treat it as a substantial corporate body with its own separate identity, and its stockholders as having property rights and interests materially different from those incident to ownership of stock in the old company.\n The findings show that it was intended to be established as such, and that it was so created in fact and in law. There is nothing to warrant us in treating this separateness as imaginary, unless the identity of the body of stockholders and the transfer in solido of the manufacturing business and assets from the old company to the \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 174]\n\u00a0\n new necessarily have that effect. But the identity of stockholders was but a temporary condition, subject to change at any moment at the option of any individual. As to the assets, the very fact of their transfer from one company to the other evidenced the actual separateness of the two companies.\n But, further, it would be erroneous, we think, to test the question whether an individual stockholder derived income in the true and substantial sense through receiving a part in the distribution of the new shares, by regarding alone the general effect of the reorganization upon the aggregate body of stockholders. The liability of a stockholder to pay an individual income tax must be tested by the effect of the transaction upon the individual. It was a part of the purpose and a necessary result of the plan of reorganization, as carried out, that common stock of the new company to the extent of $58,854,200 should be turned over to the old company, treated by it as assets to be distributed as against its liability to stockholders for accrued surplus, and thereupon distributed to them 'as a dividend.' The assent of the stockholders was based upon this as a part of the plan.\n In thus creating the common stock of the new company and transferring it to the old company for distribution pro rata among its stockholders, the parties were acting in the exercise of their rights for the very purpose of placing the common stockholders individually in possession of new and substantial property rights in esse, in realization of their former contingent right to participate eventually in the accumulated surplus. No question is made but that the proceedings taken were legally adequate to accomplish the purpose. The new common stock became treasury assets of the old company, and was capable of distribution as the manufacturing assets whose place it took were not. Its distribution transferred to the several stockholders new individual property rights which they \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 175]\n\u00a0\n severally were entitled to retain and enjoy, or to sell and transfer, with precisely the same substantial benefit to each as if the old company had acquired the stock by purchase from strangers. According to the findings the stock thus distributed was marketable. There was neither express nor implied condition, arising out of the plan of reorganization or otherwise, to prevent any stockholder from selling it; and he could sell his entire portion or any of it without parting with his capital interest in the parent company, or affecting his proportionate relation to the interests of other stockholders. Whether he sold the new stock for money or retained it in preference, in either case when he received it he received as his separate property a part of the accumulated profits of the old company in which previously he had only a potential and contingent interest.\n It thus appears that in substance and fact, as well as in appearance, the dividend received by claimant was a gain, a profit derived from his capital interest in the old company, not in liquidation of the capital, but in distribution of accumulated profits of the company; something of exchangeable value produced by and proceeding from his investment therein, severed from it and drawn by him for his separate use. Hence it constituted individual income within the meaning of the Income Tax Law, as clearly as was the the case in Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 U.S. 347\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 546.\n Judgment of the Court of Claims reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the suit.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting.\n In the course of its opinion, citing Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 213\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, the Court of Claims declared:\n'We think the whole transaction is to be regarded as merely a financial reorganization of the business of the company and that this view is justified by the power and duty of the court to look through the form of the transaction \n\n[257 U.S. 156, 176]\n\u00a0\n to its substance.'\n\n And further:\n'It seems incredible that Congress intended to tax as income a business transaction which admittedly produced no gain, no profit, and hence no income. If any income had accrued to the plaintiff by reason of the sale and exchange made it would doubtless be taxable.'\n\n There were perfectly good reasons for the reorganization and the good faith of the parties is not questioned. I assume that the statute was not intended to put an embargo upon legitimate reorganizations when deemed essential for carrying on important enterprises. Eisner v. Macomber was rightly decided and the principle which I think it announced seems in conflict with the decision just announced.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ROGERS(1921)\nNo. 147\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 163, 164]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnett, for the United States.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George S. Downer, of Albuquerque, N. M., for defendants in error. \n\n[255 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought an action January 18, 1915, in the District Court of the United States for New Mexico, to condemnlands of the defendants in error for reclamation purposes. 32 Stat. 388 (Comp. St.  4700-4708). Condemnation proceedings to acquire real estate for government uses and public purposes under judicial process are regulated by the act of August 1, 1888. 25 Stat. 357 (Comp. St.  6909, 6910).\n Section 2 of the act provides that the practice, pleadings, forms, and modes of proceedings in causes arising under the provisions of the act shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, forms, and proceedings existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record in the state within which such Circuit or District Courts are held.\n The petition averred the necessity of appropriating the lands in question; that the Secretary of the Interior had determined to acquire the defendants' real estate; that at the date of the completion of the work lands of the defendants were flooded and thereby appropriated by the United States under the authority of the acts of Congress; that the owners received no compensation; that necessary funds were available to pay any damages which might be awarded defendants. The petition prayed that the court appoint commissioners to assess the damage which the owners had sustained in consequence of the taking and appropriation of their lands, and that upon payment of the amount asessed the lands be decreed to be the property of the United States from the date of the appropriation thereof.\n The award of the commissioners was filed February 3, 1917, and an order was entered July 27, 1917, directing that the sums awarded be deposited and distributed for the benefit of the owners. Subsequently the owners made a motion for a supplemental order requiring the \n\n[255 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n United States to deposit sums equal to 6 per cent. interest on the awards calculated from April 19, 1912, the time when the lands were taken by flooding the same. The court made an order requiring the deposit of the additional sum, to which order the United States excepted, and prosecuted a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, where the judgment of the District Court was affirmed. 257 Fed. 397, 168 C. C. A. 437.\n It appears that the allowance of interest was from the time of the actual taking of the land to the time deposit was made in payment for the same.\n The questions upon which the case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals appear from the assignments of error, and are: (1) That the District Court erred in awarding interest against the United States from April 12, 1912, to date of deposit of the awards in court, for the reason that interest cannot properly be allowed in a condemnation case against the United States for any period prior to date of final judgment; (2) that the District Court erred in awarding interest against the United States from April 19, 1912, to date of deposit of awards in court, for the reason that interest cannot properly be allowed in a condemnation case against the United States for any period prior to date of the order of the court placing the United States in possession of the lands condemned; (3) that the District Court erred in awarding interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum against the United States from April 19, 1912, to date of deposit of awards in court, for the reason that there is no authority of law for allowing interest at said rate on judgments against the United States.\n As we are reviewing the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the assignments of error in that court are the ones open here, and it is evident from what we have said that the question in substance comes to this: Was there error in awarding the owners interest on the value \n\n[255 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n of their lands appropriated from the time of actual taking of the same until compensation was made?\n It is unquestionably true that the United States upon claims made against it cannot, in the absence of a statute to that end, be subjected to the payment of interest. Angarica v. Bayard, \n127 \nU.S. 251, 260\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1156; United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 920, cited and approved in National Volunteer Home v. Parrish, \n229 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 944. In the present case the landowners did not sue upon a claim against the government, as was the fact in United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 U.S. 330\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 518. The government was seeking for purposes authorized by statute to appropriate the lands, and it had actually taken them, and had deprived the owners of all beneficial use thereof from the date from which the allowance of interest ran.\n Having taken the lands of the defendants in error, it was the duty of the government to make just compensation as of the time when the owners were deprived of their property. Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 341\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622.\n In fixing the compensation the District Court, and the Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment, followed the New Mexico statute fixing the rate of interest at 6 per cent. This was in conformity with a former ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals applying the statutes of Minnesota to lands appropriated in that state. United States v. Sargent, 162 Fed. 81, 89 C. C. A. 81.\n The government urges that the Conformity Act of August 1, 1888, does not require the United States government to be bound by the rule of the state statute in the allowance of interest. This may be true, but we agree with the courts below that the allowance of just compensation by giving interest from the time of taking until payment is a convenient and fair method of ascertaining the sum to which the owner of the land is entitled. The \n\n[255 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n fact that the rule is in harmony with the policy of the state where the lands are situated does not militate against, but makes for, the justice and propriety of its adoption. Union States v. Sargent, supra.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the same is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

St.  10305) which provides as follows:\n'Whoever corruplty, or by threats or force,\n\n'Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, shall endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede any witness, in any court of the United States or before any United States commissioner or officer acting as such commissioner, or any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States commissioner or officer acting as such commissioner, in the discharge of his duty, or who corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, shall influence, obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice therein, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.' \n\n[255 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n The government does not press the case on count 2. It is only necessary, therefore, to consider count 1. It charges defendant with unlawfully and corruptly endeavoring to influence one William D. Russell, who, he well knew, was a petit juror in the court in the discharge of his, the juror's duty, and who he knew had been summoned as a petit juror on April 3, 1918, at which time the trial of William D. Haywood and others was to begin. The manner of the execution of the violation of the section the indictment details as follows:\n\n'Endeavoring to ascertain in advance of the examination of said William D. Russell in said court as to his qualifications to sit as a petit juror at said trial whether said William D. Russell was favorably inclined towards said William D. Haywood and his codefendants, and corruptly to induce said William D. Russell to favor the acquittal of said William D. Haywood and his codefendants in case he should be selected as a petit juror at said trial, said L. C. Russell, on said April 1, 1918, called at the home of said William D. Russell at No. 604 West Thirty-First street, in said city of Chicago, and engaged Lucy Russell, wife of said William D. Russell, in a conversation, in the course of which said L. C. Russell told said Lucy Russell that he represented said William D. Haywood and his codefendants and requested her to question her husband as to his attitude towards said William D. Maywood and his codefendants in the matter of the charges contained in said indictment and report the result of such questioning to him, the said L. C. Russell, because, as said L. C. Russell then and there stated to said Lucy Russell, they (meaning said William D. Haywood and his codefendants) did not want to pay money to any of the petit jurors sitting at the trial of said case unless they knew such petit jurors would favor their acquittal; by means of which request and statement said L. C. Russell conveyed to Lucy Russell, and endeavored to convey to said William \n\n[255 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n D. Russell, an offer to pay money to said William D. Russell in return for his favoring such acquittal. ...'\n\n Defendant demurred to the indictment on the ground that it did not appear therefrom by any sufficient averment or recital of--\n'jurisdictional facts that any cause involving any issue of fact triable by a jury, was at the time in said indictment mentioned, pending in the District Court of the United States, or any other court, whereby the above named United States District Court does or could acquire jurisdiction in the premises.'\n\n The enumeration of the deficiencies of the indictment may be summarized as follows: It did not appear that William D. Russeli possessed the qualifications to act as a juror; or had been duly and regularly drawn and summoned; or had been examined and accepted as a juror at the array; it cannot be ascertained at what time and place the alleged conversation was had; or at what time Lucy Russell received the impression of the meaning of the conversation; or that she had access to her husband or had opportunity, or could have communicated the conversation to him; or that defendant knew she had such opportunity; or that William D. Russell was a juror in any particular case.\n The demurrer was sustained and the indictment dismissed. This writ of error was then allowed.\n Necessarily, the first impression of the case is that defendant had some purpose in his approach to Lucy Russell and in the proposition he made to her. What was it, and how far did he execute it? Counsel admits that defendant's purpose was to 'find out what his [L. C. Russell's] attitude was towards the defendants to be tried,' and that this (we are stating the effect of counsel's contention) was only in preparation of a sinister purpose, that the defendants in the case did not wish to undertake, or, to use the language of the indictment, did \n\n[255 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n not 'want to pay money to any of the petit jourors sitting at the trial of said case unless they knew such petit jurors would favor their acquittal'; and this, counsel says, 'only amounted to a solicitation of a third person who did not accept or act in furtherance of such solicitation' and 'could be interpreted only ... to be preparation [italics counsel's] for an 'endeavor' or 'attempt' to influence the juror, but falls far short of an actual endeavor to do so.'\n Counsel enters into quite a discussion, with citation of cases, of the distinction between preparations for an attempt and the attempt itself, and charges that there is a wide difference between them.\n We think, however, that neither the contention nor the cases are pertinent to the section under review and upon which the indictment was based. The word of the section is 'endeavor,' and by using it the section got rid of the technicalities which might be urged as besetting the word 'attempt,' and it describes any effort or essay to do or accomplish the evil purpose that the section was enacted to prevent. Criminality does not get rid of its evil quality by the precautions it takes against consequences, personal or pecuniary. It is a somewhat novel excuse to urge that Russell's action was not criminal, because he was cautious enough to consider its cost and be sure of its success. The section, however, is not directed at success in corrupting a juror, but at the 'endeavor' to do so. Experimental approaches to the corruption of a juror are the 'endeavor' of the section. Guilt is incurred by the trial-success may aggravate; it is not a condition of it.\n The indictment charges that defendant knew that William D. Russell was a petit juror in the discharge of his duty as such juror, and therefore an endeavor to corruptly influence him was within the section, though he was not yet selected or sworn. State v.

SACKS(1921)\nNo. 48\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 37, 38]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Joseph A. Seidman, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents for consideration an indictment in three counts for the violation, respectively, of sections 148 and 151 of the Criminal Code of the United States (Comp. St.  10318, 10321), as dependent upon the construction of an act of Congress to which we shall refer.\n The first two counts charge that Sacks did 'with intent to defraud, altered an obligation of the United States, to wit, a war savings certificate of the United States of the series of 1918, in that he did tear from the face of said war savings certificate two war savings certificate stamps of the United States of the series of 1918, thereto attached.'\n The third count charges Sacks with having in his possession with intent to defraud the United States, and with intent to pass and sell the same, an altered obligation of the United States, to wit, a portion of a war savings certificate of the United States of the series of 1918, with three war savings certificate stamps thereto attached, in that the portion which he had and kept in his possession had been torn from a whole war savings certificate.\n The indictment is illustrated by having examples of the certificates attached. They certify, subject to the terms and conditions expressed thereon, that the owner will be entitled to receive January 1, 1923, in respect to each \n\n[257 U.S. 37, 39]\n\u00a0\n stamp of the series of 1918 then affixed thereto, the amount indicated thereon as then payable, or at his option, will be entitled to receive at an earlier date a lesser amount indicated by a table thereon.\n Among the terms and conditions are the following:\n'(1) This certificate is not a valid obligation unless a United States war savings certificate stamp of the series of 1918 is affixed hereto. (2) This certificate is of no value except to the owner named hereon, and is not transferable. (3) Not more than 20 United States war savings certificate stamps, and only such stamps of the series of 1918, may be affixed hereto. (6) The law provides that no one person shall at any one time hold war savings certificates to an aggregate amount exceeding one thousand dollars.'\n\n The names of the owners are indorsed on the certificates, and their addresses.\n The indictment was quashed on Sack's motion on the ground, recited in the judgment, that the indictment was not--\n'authorized under any construction of the act of Congress upon which it is alleged to be predicated, to wit, the Act of Congress of September 24, 1917, and section 6, and as amended by the Act of Congress of September 24, 1918, section 2 thereof (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6829l) and sections 148 and 151 of the Criminal Code of the United States, or under the construction of any other statute of the United States now in force.'\n\n The judgment and the action of the court are assigned as error. The construction of the sections of the Criminal Code and the act of Congress referred to is necessarily involved: Section 148 makes an offender 'whoever, with intent to defraud, shall falsely make, forge, counterfeit, or alter any obligation or other security of the United States; ...' section 151 makes an offender 'whoever, with intent to defraud, shall pass, utter, publish, or sell' or attempt to do either act, 'or shall keep in \n\n[257 U.S. 37, 40]\n\u00a0\n possession or concealed with like intent any falsely made, ... counterfeited, or altered obligation or other security of the United States. ...'\n Section 147 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10317) defines obligations and securities of the United States to be evidences of indebtedness, and adds to a specific enumeration the comprehensive words 'stamps and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, which have been or may be issued under any act of Congress.'\n Section 154 (section 10324) makes dealing in the false and counterfeited obligations of either section an offense.\n The Act of Congress of September 24, 1917 (40 Stat. 291), authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow from time to time on the credit of the United States, such sum or sums as in his judgment may be necessary, and to issue therefor, at such price or prices, and upon such terms and conditions as he may determine, war savings certificates of the United States on which interest to maturity may be discounted in advance at such rate or rates and computed in such manner as he may prescribe. Further detail of the act is not necessary except to say that the amount of certificates sold to any one person at any one time shall not exceed $100- nor shall any one person at any one time hold more than $1,000. And it is provided that the Secretary of the Treasury may upon such terms and regulations as he may prescribe, issue or cause to be issued, stamps to evidence payment for or on account of such certificates.\n It will be observed from this statement of the provisions of the law that to sustain the indictment there must be the fact of an alteration of an obligation of the United States, or having in possession an altered obligation with intent to pass and sell the same. It is contended by Sacks that such was not the condition and to sustain the contention two propositions are urged: (1) That neithre the certificate nor the stamps was an obligation \n\n[257 U.S. 37, 41]\n\u00a0\n of the United States. (2) That the removal of the stamps was the destruction of the certificate, not its alteration. The purpose of section 148, it is contended, is to prevent the utterance and passing of spurious instruments and the alteration of genuine ones either by changing their form, or increasing or decreasing their obligation. In development and illustration of the contention, it is asserted that the government received full value for the stamps, and its liability thereon was fixed when the stamps came into Sacks' possession and continued the same no matter how many times the stamps changed hands. 'The owner of the stamp could affix it to or remove it from the card (certificate) without changing the obligation of the United States.' And further, 'the definition to be given the word 'alteration' is no different in the case of a government obligation than the alteration of a private obligation. If the alteration does not prejudice the rights of the obligor the act of alteration will not constitute a crime.' Cases are cited in support of the contentions.\n The contentions are based on a misapprehension of the act providing for the certificates and the necessary relation of the sections of the Criminal Code to the purposes of that act. Whether the certificates or the stamps be considered individual or composite obligations of the United States necessarily the alteration of both or either is within section 148 of the Criminal Code. Their purpose is defeated and perhaps perverted by alteration. They are but instruments of the law and the law is to be considered. It provided an opportunity of investment for persons of small means, and the power to prescribe ways adequate to the purpose was given to the Secretary of the Treasury. In other words, details of execution were committed to him with power to give to the certificated and the stamps such character, quality and legal effect that he should consider to be efficient. And exercising the power, he included \n\n[257 U.S. 37, 42]\n\u00a0\n as a condition to the validity of the certificate as an obligation of the United States, the affixing of a stamp thereto, and that not more than 20 stamps of the series of 1918 might be affixed, and that no one person could at any one time hold certificates of an aggregate amount exceeding $ 1,000.\n These conditions were defeated and intended to be defeated by the action of Sacks in tearing from the face of the certificate two stamps. Such action constituted an alteration of the certificate and the stamps with intent to use the same without the remainder of the certificate signed by the purchaser and thus to defraud the United States by defeating the purposes of the law of September 24, 1917, and the circulars of the Secretary of the Treasury empowered to be issued under that law, and the terms and conditions indorsed on the certificate, and the court's decision to the contrary was a misconstruction of the Act of September 24.\n There therefore was a violation of section 151 as charged in the third count of the indictment, Sacks having in his possession with intent to defraud the United State, an altered obligation of the United States.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. STRANG(1921)\nNo. 206\nArgued: December 9, 1920Decided: January 3, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for the United states.\n Mr. John W. Dodge, of Jacksonville, Fla., for defendants in error. \n\n[254 U.S. 491, 492]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The ultimate question for determination is whether the employment of defendant Strang as an inspector by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, without more, made him an agent of the government within the meaning of section 41, Criminal Code.\n'Sec. 41. No officer or agent of any corporation, join-stock company, or association, and no member or agent of any firm, or person directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary profits or contracts of such corporation, joint-stock company, association, or firm, shall be employed or shall act as an officer or agent of the United States for the transaction of business with such corporation, joint-stock company, association, or firm. Whoever shall violate the provision of this section shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars and imprisoned not more than two years.' Comp. St.  10205.\n\n Holding that this employment did not suffice to create the relation alleged, the trial court sustained a demurrer to the indictment. It contains four counts, three of which charge that Strang unlawfully acted as agent of the United States in transacting business with the Duval Ship Outfitting Company, a copartnership of which he was a member, in that while an employee of the Fleet Corporation as an inspector he signed and executed (February, 1919) three separate orders to the Outfitting Company for repairs and alterations on the steamship Lone Star. The other defendants are charged with aiding and abetting him. The trial court and counsel here have treated the fourth count as charging all the defendants with conspiracy to commit the offenses set forth in the three preceding counts. United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465, 7 A. L. R. 443.\n Counsel for the government maintain that the Fleet \n\n[254 U.S. 491, 493]\n\u00a0\n Corporation is an agency or instrumentality of the United States formed only as an arm for executing purely governmental powers and duties vested by Congress in the President and by him delegated to it; that the acts of the corporation within its delegated authority are the acts of the United States; that therefore in placing orders with the Duval Company in behalf of the Fleet Corporation while performing the duties as inspector Strang necessarily acted as agent of the United States.\n The demurrer was properly sustained.\n As authorized by the Act of September 7, 1916 (39 Stat. 728), the United States Shipping Board caused the Fleet Corporation to be organized ( April 16, 1917) under laws of the District of Columbia with $50,000,000 capital stock, all owned by the United States, and it became an operating agency of that board. Later, the President directed that the corporation should have and exercise a specified portion of the power and authority in respect of ships granted to him by the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 182), and he likewise authorized the Shipping Board to exercise through it another portion of such power and authority. See The Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246, 252\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 460. The corporation was controlled and managed by its own officers and appointed its own servants and agents who became directly responsible to it. Notwithstanding all its stock was owned by the United States it must be regarded as a separate entity. Its inspectors were not appointed by the President, nor by any officer designated by Congress; they were subject to removal by the corporation only and could contract only for it. In such circumstances we think they were not agents of the United States within the true intendment of section 41.\n Generally agents of a corporation are not agents of the stockholders and cannot contract for the latter. Apparently this was one reason why Congress authorized organization of the Fleet Corporation. Bank of the United \n\n[254 U.S. 491, 494]\n\u00a0\n States v.

WOODWARD(1921)\nNo. 811\nArgued: April 18, 1921Decided: June 6, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. Solicitor General Frierson and Frank Davis, Jr., of Columbus, Ohio, for the United States.\n Mr. E. J. Smyer, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the executors of Joseph H. Woodward, deceased, for money \n\n[256 U.S. 632, 633]\n\u00a0\n claimed to have been erroneously exacted from them as a tax on the income of his estate while in their hands.\n The testator died December 15, 1917. The Revenue Act of 19161 'imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent' dying thereafter a tax which it called an 'estate tax.' The act fixed the amount of the tax at a named percentage 'of the value of the net estate,' made the tax a lien upon the 'entire gross estate,' required that it be paid 'out of the estate' before distribution, declared that it should 'be due one year after the decedent's death,' charged the executor or administrator with the duty of paying it, and declared that the receipt therefor should entitle him to a credit for the amount in the usual settlement of his accounts. Under that act these executors were required to pay an estate tax of $489,834.07. The tax became due December 15, 1918, and they paid it February 8, 1919. Shortly thereafter the executors made a return, under the Revenue Act of 1918,2 of the income of the testator's estate for the taxable year 1918 and claimed in the return that in ascertaining the net income for that year the estate tax of $489,834.07 should be deducted. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to allow the deduction and assessed an income tax of $165,075.78 against the estate. Had the deduction been allowed, there would have been no taxable net income for that year, and no part of the $165,075.78 would have been collectible. Payment of that sum, as so assessed, was pressed on the executors, and they paid it under duress. Then, after taking the necessary steps to entitle them to do so, they brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the money thus exacted from them.\n The sole question for decision is: Was the estate tax \n\n[256 U.S. 632, 634]\n\u00a0\n paid by the executors, and claimed by them as a deduction in the income tax return for the year 1918, an allowable deduction in ascertaining the net taxable income of the estate for that year? The Court of Claims held that it was.\n The solution of the question turns entirely upon the statutory provisions under which the two taxes were severally collected. The act of 1918, by sections 210, 211 and 219, subjects the net income 'received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement' to an income tax measured by fixed percentages thereof, by sections 212 and 219 requires that the net income be ascertained by taking the gross income, as defined in section 213, and making the deductions named in section 214, and by section 214 makes express provision for the deduction of 'taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except income, war profits and excess profits taxes.' This last provision is the important one here. It is not ambiguous, but explicit, and leaves little room for construction. The words of its major clause are comprehensive and include every tax which is charged against the estate by the authority of the United States. The excepting clause specifically enumerates what is to be excepted. The implication from the latter is that the taxes which it enumerates would be within the major clause were they not expressly excepted, and also that there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes were as well known at the time the provision was framed as the ones particularly excepted. Indeed, the same act, by sections 400-410 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 a-6336 3\/4 k), expressly provides for their continued imposition and enforcement. Thus their omission from the excepting clause means that Congress did not intend to except them.\n The act of 1916 calls the estate tax a 'tax' and particularly denominates it an 'estate tax.' This court recently has recognized that it is a duty or excise and is \n\n[256 U.S. 632, 635]\n\u00a0\n imposed in the exertion of the taxing power of the United States. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 U.S. 345\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 506, 65 L. Ed. --. It is made a charge on the estate and is to be paid out of it by the administrator or executor substantially as other taxes and charges are paid. It becomes due not at the time of the decedent's death, as suggested by counsel for the government, but one year thereafter, as the statute plainly provides. It does not segregate any part of the estate from the rest and keep it from passing to the administrator or executor for purposes of administration, as counsel contend, but is made a general charge on the gross estate and is to be paid in money out of any available funds, or, if there be none, by converting other property into money for the purpose.\n Here the estate tax not only 'accrued,' which means became due, during the taxable year of 1918, but it was paid before the income for that year was returned or required to be returned. When the return was made the executors claimed a deduction by reason of that tax. We hold that under the terms of the act of 1918 the deduction should have been allowed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 463, title II, 39 Stat. 777 (Comp.

Krum, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Required on this direct appeal to decide whether Congress under the Constitution had authority to adopt \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n section 4 of the Lever Act as re-enacted in 1919, we reproduce the section so far as relevant (Act Oct. 22, 1919, tit. 1, c. 80,  2, 41 Stat. 297):\n'That it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully ... to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries; to conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person ... (e) to exact excessive prices for any necessaries. ... Any person violating any of the provisions of this section upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding $5,000 or be imprisoned for not more than two years, or both. ...'\n\n The text thus reproduced is followed by two provisos exempting from the operation either of the section or of the act enumerated persons or classes of persons engaged in agricultural or similar pursuits.\n Comparing the re-enacted section with the original text (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53,  4, 40 Stat. 276 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919 ,  3115 1\/8 ff]), it will be seen that the only changes made by the re- enactment were the insertion of the penalty clause and an enlargement of the enumerated exemptions.\n In each of two counts the defendant, the Cohen Grocery Company, alleged to be a dealer in sugar and other necessaries in the city of St. Louis, was charged with violating this section by willfully and feloniously making an unjust and unreasonable rate and charge in handling and dealing in a certain necessary; the specification in the first count being a sale for $10.07 of about 50 pounds of sugar, and that in the second, of a 100-pound bag of sugar for $19.50.\n The defendant demurred on the following grounds: (a) That both counts were so vague as not to inform it of the nature and cause of the accusation; (b) that the statute upon which the indictment was based was subject to the same infirmity because it was so indefinite as not to enable it to be known what was forbidden, and \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 87]\n\u00a0\n therefore amounted to a delegation by Congress of legislative power to courts and juries to determine what acts should be held to be criminal and punishable; and (c) that as the country was virtually at peace Congress had no power to regulate the subject with which the section dealt. In passing on the demurrer the court, declaring that this court had settled that until the official declaration of peace there was a status of war, nevertheless decided that such conclusion was wholly negligible as to the other issues raised by the demurrer, since it was equally well settled by this court that the mere status of war did not of its own force suspend or limit the effect of the Constitution, but only caused limitations which the Constitution made applicable as the necessary and appropriate result of the status of war, to become operative. Holding that this latter result was not the case as to the particular provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments which it had under consideration; that is, as to the prohibitions which those amendments imposed upon Congress against delegating legislative power to courts and juries, against penalizing indefinite acts, and against depriving the citizen of the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, the court, giving effect to the amendments in question, came to consider the grounds of demurrer relating to those subjects. In doing so and referring to an opinion previously expressed by it in charging a jury, the court said:\n'Congress alone has power to define crimes against the United States. This power cannot be delegated either to the courts or to the juries of this country. ...\n\n'Therefore, because the law is vague, indefinite, and uncertain, and because it fixes no immutable standard of guilt, but leaves such standard to the variant views of the different courts and juries which may be called on to enforce it, and because it does not inform defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 88]\n\u00a0\n I think it is constitutionally invalid, and that the demurrer offered by the defendant ought to be sustained.'\n\n The indictment was therefore quashed.\n In cases submitted at about the same time with the one before us, and involving identical questions with those here in issue, it is contended that the section does not embrace the matters charged. We come, therefore, on our own motion in this case to dispose of that subject, since, if well founded, the contention would render a consideration of the constitutional questions unnecessary. The basis upon which the contention rests is that the words of the section do not embrace the price at which a commodity is sold, and, at any rate, the receipt of such price is not thereby intended to be penalized. We are of opinion, however, that these propositions are without merit, first, because the words of the section, as re-enacted, are broad enough to embrace the price for which a commodity is sold; and, second, because as the amended section plainly imposes a penalty for the acts which it includes when committed after its passage, the fact that the section before its re-enactment contained no penalty is of no moment. This must be the case unless it can be said that the failure at one time to impose a penalty for a forbidden act furnishes an adequate ground for preventing the subsequent enforcement of a penalty which is specifically and unmistakably provided.\n We are of opinion that the court below was clearly right in ruling that the decisions of this court indisputably establish that the mere existence of a state of war could not suspend or change the operation upon the power of Congress of the guaranties and limitations of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as to questions such as we are here passing upon.

It follows that in testing the operation of the Constitution upon the subject here involved the question of the existence or nonexistence of a state of war becomes negligible, and we put it out of view.\n The sole remaining inquiry, therefore, is the certainty or uncertainty of the text in question, that is, whether the words 'that it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully ... to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries,' constituted a fixing by Congress of an ascertainable standard of guilt and are adequate to inform persons accused of violation thereof of the nature and cause of the accusation against them. That they are not, we are of opinion, so clearly results from their mere statement as to render elaboration on the subject wholly unnecessary. Observe that the section forbids no specific or definite act. It confines the subject- matter of the investigation which it authorizes to no element essentially inhering in the transaction as to which it provides. It leaves open, therefore, the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against. In fact, we see no reason to doubt the soundness of the observation of the court below in its opinion to the effect that, to attempt to enforce the section would be the exact equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury. And that this is not a mere abstraction, finds abundant demonstration in the cases now before us, since in the briefs in these cases the conflicting results which have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightended judges in seeking to carry out the statute in cases brought before them are vividly \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 90]\n\u00a0\n portrayed. As illustrative of this situation we append in the margin a statement from one of the briefs on the subject. \n2\n And again, this condition would be additionally \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 91]\n\u00a0\n obvious if we stopped to recur to the persistent efforts which, the records disclose, were made by administrative officers, doubtless inspired by a zealous effort to discharge their duty, to establish a standard of their own to be used as a basis to render the section possible of execution.\n That it results from the consideration which we have stated that the section before us was void for repugnancy to the Constitution is not open to question.

We need not stop to review them, however, first, because their inappositeness is necessarily demonstrated when it is observed that if the contention as to their effect were true it would result, in view of the text of the statute, that no standard whatever was required, no information as to the nature and cause of the accusation was essential, and that it was competent to delegate legislative power, in the very teeth of the settled significance of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and of other plainly applicable provisions of the Constitution; and, second, because the cases relied upon all rested upon the conclusion that, for reasons found to result either from the text of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded. Indeed, the distinction between the cases relied upon and those establishing the general principle to which we have referred, and which we now apply and uphold as a matter of reason and authority, is so clearly pointed out in decided cases that we deem it only necessary to cite them.

Ct. 95.\n It follows from what we have said that, not forgetful of our duty to sustain the constitutionality of the statute \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 93]\n\u00a0\n if ground can possibly be found to do so, we are nevertheless compelled in this case to say that we think the court below was clearly right in holding the statute void for repugnancy to the Constitution, and its judgment quashing the indictment on that ground must be, and it is, hereby affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, concurring.\n I concur in the judgment of the court, but not in the reasoning upon which it is rested.\n Defendant was indicted upon two counts, alike in form, charging in each case that it 'did willfully and feloniously make an unjust and unreasonable rate and charge in handling and dealing in a certain necessary, to wit, sugar,' in that it demanded, exacted and collected excessive prices for specified quantities of sugar purchased from it in violation of the Lever Act (Act Oct. 22, 1919, c. 80, tit. 1,  2, 41 Stat. 297, 298, amending section 4 of Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 277). I am convinced that the exacting of excessive prices upon the sale of merchandise is not within the meaning of that provision of the act which is cited as denouncing it; that the act does not make it a criminal offense; that for this reason the demurrer to the indictment was properly sustained; and that whether the provision is in conflict with the Fifth or Sixth Amendment is a question not necessarily raised, and which ought not to be passed upon.\n In order to appreciate the point it is necessary to quote entire so much of the section as defines the crimes thereby denounced. It reads as follows: \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 94]\n\u00a0\n 'That it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully to destroy any necessaries for the purpose of enhancing the price or restricting the supply thereof; knowingly to commit waste or willfully to permit preventable deterioration of any necessaries in or in connection with their production, manufacture, or distribution; to hoard, as defined in section 6 of this act, any necessaries; to monopolize or attempt to monopolize, either locally or generally, any necessaries; to engage in any discriminatory and unfair, or any deceptive or wasteful practice or device, or to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries; to conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person, (a) to limit the facilities for transporting, producing, harvesting, manufacturing, supplying, storing, or dealing in any necessaries; (b) to restrict the supply of any necessaries; (c) to restrict distribution of any necessaries; ( d) to prevent, limit, or lessen the manufacture or production of any necessaries in order to enhance the price thereof; or (e) to exact excessive prices for any necessaries, or to aid or abet the doing of any act made unlawful by this section. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding $5,000 or be imprisoned for not more than two years, or both: Provided, ...' etc.\n For a definition of 'hoarding,' the section refers to section 6 of the original act (40 Stat. 278 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919 ,  3115 1\/8 gg]), which declares that necessaries shall be deemed to be hoarded, within the meaning of the act, when (inter alia) 'withheld, whether by possession or under any contract or arrangement, from the market by any person for the purpose of unreasonably increasing or diminishing the price.'\n The court holds that the words 'to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries' are broad enough to embrace the exaction of an excessive price upon a sale of such \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 95]\n\u00a0\n merchandise. Why Congress should employ so unskillful and ambiguous a phrase for the purpose, when it would have been easy to express the supposed purpose in briefer and more lucid words, it is difficult to understand. If the words were to be taken alone, and without reference to the context, it might be possible to stretch their meaning so as to include the exaction of an excessive price. But to do this with a statute defining a criminal offense would, it seems to me, be inconsistent with established rules for construing penal statutes; not only so, but it would violate the rule that a statute is not to be so construed as to bring in into conflict with the Constitution, unless such construction is imperatively required by its plain words. The construction adopted by the court is not thus required. 'To make a rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with' merchandise, imports the fixing of compensation for services, rather than the price at which goods are to be sold. It may refer to charges for buying, selling, hauling, handling, storage, or the like.\n But the clause in question does not stand alone. It forms a part of a section in which the question of prices is dealt with four times: once in the initial prohibition against destroying any necessaries for the purpose of enhancing the price; a second time in the prohibition of hoarding, defined as including a withholding from market for the purpose of unreasonably increasing or diminishing the price; a third time in the prohibition of a conspiracy to limit the production of necessaries in order to enhance the price; and, finally, in the prohibition of a conspiracy 'to exact excessive prices for any necessaries.' It seems to me clear, upon the plainest principles of construction that the change of phrase must be deemed to import a difference of purpose, and that 'to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries' must be taken to mean something else than the exaction of an excessive price. It should be \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 96]\n\u00a0\n observed how closely it is coupled with a cognate offense: 'To engage in any discriminatory and unfair, or any deceptive or wasteful practice or device, or to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries.' Evidently the words 'in handling or dealing,' etc., qualify 'wasteful practice or device,' as well as 'unjust or unreasonable rate or charge.'\n That it is not altogether evident what was intended to be included within 'unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries,' may be conceded. So much the more reason for not extending the words by construction so as to make criminal that which is not clearly within their meaning, and for not giving to them a meaning which brings the act into conflict with the Constitution, and for not expanding the unconstitutional reach of the act, supposing that even without the particular application now made of the quoted words it would be repugnant to the fundamental law.\n It is to my mind plain that section 4 was not intended to control the individual dealer with respect to the prices that he might exact, beyond prohibiting him from destroying any necessaries for the purpose of enhancing the price, and from withholding them from the market for a like purpose. So long as he acts alone he is left uncontrolled except by the ordinary processes of competition, his own sense of fairness, and his own interest. A conspiracy with others to exact excessive prices is an entirely different matter and that is clearly prohibited.\n And this bring me to another point: Section 4 naturally divides itselt into two parts; the first portion denounces a number of substantive offenses; the second portion denounces a conspiracy to commit any one of a number of offenses, but these do not in terms include any of the offenses specifically prohibited in the earlier \n\n[255 U.S. 81, 97]\n\u00a0\n portion. This, as it seems to me, is significant. Section 37 of theCriminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1088, 1096 [Comp. St .  10201]), makes it criminal for two or more persons to conspire to commit any offense against the United States, if one or more of them do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy. Hence it was not necessary for Congress to declare in the Lever Act that a conspiracy to commit any of the offenses defined in the first part of section 4 was punishable criminally. But it proceeded in the latter part to declare that a conspiracy to do any one of certain other acts, should be criminal. It seems to me too plain for argument that, under the circumstances, the inclusion in that part of the section of certain acts as forming the object of a criminal conspiracy amounts to a legislative declaration that, in the absence of conspiracy, those acts are not intended to be punished criminally. One of them is 'to exact excessive prices for any necessaries.'\n Still further: Sections 14 and 25 of the original act (40 Stat. 281, 284 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 kk, 3115 1\/8 q ]) specifically deal with the question of official price-fixing of certain articles of prime necessity-wheat, coal, and coke-and furnish additional evidence that in the framing of this act, when Congress had price-fixing in mind and the regulation of 'prices,' it employed that simple term, and that it did not refer to prices in the provision of section 4 upon which the indictment in this case rests.\n For these reasons, I regard it as unnecessary to pass upon the question whether that provision is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 37 Sup. Ct. 380. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In U. S. v. Leonard, District Judge Howe, of the Northern District of New York, held that in determining whether or not a price was unreasonable, the jury should take into consideration 'what prices the defendants paid for the goods in the market-whether they bought them in the ordinary course of trade, paying the market price at the time, the length of time defendants have carried them in stock, the expense of carrying on the business, what a fair and reasonable profit on the goods would be, and all the other facts and circumstances in and about the transaction, but not how much the market price had advanced from the time the goods were purchased to the time they were sold.'\n In U. S. v. Oglesby Grocery Co., 264 Fed. 691, District Judge Sibley of the Northern District of Georgia, said:\n'The words used by Congress in reference to a well-established course of business fairly indicate the usual and established scale of charges and prices in peace times as a basis, coupled with some flexibility in view of changing conditions. The statute may be construed to forbid, in time of war, any departure from the usual and established scale of charges and prices in time of peace, which is not justified by some special circumstance of the commodity or dealer.'\n\n Judge McCall, of the Western District of Tennessee, in his charge to the grand jury, stated that, if a shoe dealer bought two orders of exactly the same kind of shoes at different times and at different prices, the first lot at $8 per pair and the second lot after the price had gone up to $ 12 per pair 'and then he sells both lots of those shoes at $18, he is profiteering clearly upon the first lot if that only cost him $8. Now he does that upon the theory that if he sells these shoes out and goes into the market and buys again he will have to pay the higher price, but that doesn't excuse him. He is entitled to make a reasonable profit, but he certainly hasn't the right to take advantage of the former low purchase and take the same profit on them that he gets on the $12 shoes.'\n In U. S. v. Myatt, 264 Fed. 442, district Judge Connor, of the Eastern District of North Carolina, said:\n'It will be observed that the statute does not declare it unlawful to make an unjust or unreasonable profit upon sugar. The profit made is not the test, and may be entirely irrelevant to the guilt of the defendant. He may, within the language of the statute, make an unreasonable, and therefore unlawful, 'rate or charge' without making any profit, or the rate or charge made may involve a loss to him upon the purchasing price.'\n\n District Judge Hand, of the Northern District of New York, in his charge to the grand jury, said:\n'Furthermore, it is not the particular profits that the individual himself makes which is the basis of the unreasonable charge, but it is whether the charge is such as gives unreasonable profit-not to him, but if established generally in the trade. The law does not mean to say that all people shall charge the same profit. If I am a particularly skillful merchant or manufacturer and I can make profits which are greater than the run of people in my business, I am allowed to make those profits. So much am I allowed. But if I am charging more than a reasonable price, taking the industry as a whole, I am not allowed to keep that profit because on other items I am sustaining a loss.' \n\n In U. S. v. Goldberg, District Judge Bledsoe, of the Southern District of California, charged the jury that, in passing on the question of the reasonableness of prices for sugar the jury should take into considerations, among other circumstances, the following:\n'That there was, if you find that there was, a market price here in the community or generally with respect to the profit that normally should be made upon sugar sold either by manufacturers or jobbers and retailers.'\n\n In U. S. v. Culbertson, etc., Co., District Judge Rudkin, of the Eastern District of Washington, on the trial of defendant on July 8, 1920, charged the jury, among other things, that as a matter of law, defendant was entitled to sell its goods on the basis of the actual market value at the time and place of sale over and above the expense of handling the goods, and a reasonable profit, and that the original cost price became immaterial, except as it threw some light upon the market value. \n\n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. NORTHERN PAC. RY. CO.(1921)\nNo. 325\nArgued: October 7, 1920Decided: April 11, 1921\n\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for the United States.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to cancel a patent issued to the railway company for 5,681.76 acres of land in Montana, the asserted ground for such relief being that the land officers issued the patent through inadvertence and mistake. The company prevailed in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals, 264 Fed. 898, and the United States brought the case here.\n The lands in question are within the indemnity limits of the land grant made to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of July 2, 1864, c. 217, 13 Stat. 365, as modified and supplemented by the joint resolution of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 378, and were selected and patented as indemnity for lands lost within the place limits. The rights and obligations of the original railroad company arising out of the grant have long since passed to the present railway company and there is no need here for distinguishing one company from the other.\n The grant was made for the declared purpose of 'aiding in the construction' of a proposed line of railroad from Lake Superior to Puget Sound and Portland, Or., \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n and 'to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war and public stores' over such line. It was expressed in present terms-'there be, and hereby is, granted'-and was of 'every alternate section of public land, not mineral designated by odd numbers' within prescribed place limits on each side of the line excepting such sections or parts of sections as should be found to have been otherwise disposed of, appropriated or claimed, or occupied by homestead settlers, or pre-empted, prior to the definite location of the line. Nelson v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n188 U.S. 108\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 302. As indemnity for any lands so excepted, as also for any excluded as mineral, other lands were to be 'selected by said company,' under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, from unoccupied, unappropriated, nonmineral lands in odd-numbered sections within prescribed indemnity limits. The line of the road was to be definitely located by filing a map or maps thereof in the General Land Office, and the road when constructed was to be 'subject to the use of the United States, for postal, military, naval, and all government service, and also subject to such regulations as Congress may impose restricting the charges for such government transportation.' As each consecutive 25 miles of road was constructed and made ready for the service contemplated, the same was to be examined by commissioners selected by the President, and, if they reported that the same was completed in all respects as required, patents were to be issued to the company for the lands opposite to and coterminous with the completed section. The president was to cause the lands along 'the entire line' to be surveyed for 40 miles in width on both sides 'after the general route shall be fixed, and as fast as shall be required by the construction of said road'; the granted sections within the pace limits were to be withheld from sale, entry and pre-emption, except as against pre-emption and \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 60]\n\u00a0\n homestead occupants whose settlement preceded the definite location of the line; all lands within the indemnity limits were to be and remain subject to the operation of the pre-emption and homestead laws, save as the odd- numbered sections should be taken out of the operation of those laws by indemnity selections made to supply losses within the place limits (Hewitt v. Schultz, \n180 U.S. 139\n, 147-149, 155, 156, 21 Sup. Ct. 309; Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 387\n, 388 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 300); and the price of the even-numbered sections retained by the United States in the place limits was to be increased to double the usual minimum. If the company accepted the terms on which the grant was made, it was required to signify its acceptance in writing under its corporate seal within two years.\n The company duly accepted the terms of the grant, filed appropriate maps of the general route, afterwards definitely located the line in the mode prescribed, and constructed and completed the road from Ashland, Wis., on Lake Superior, to Tacoma, Wash., on Puget Sound, and thence to Portland, Or., its full length being more than 2,000 miles. The definite location was completed in 1884 and the construction in 1887. The road as completed was examined and favorably reported by the commissioners and accepted by the President.

Ct. 330.\n The losses to the grant in the place limits through other disposals, homestead settlements and the like prior to the definite location of the line, and through the exclusion of lands found to be mineral, amounted to several million acres. To supply these losses it was necessary to resort to the indemnity limits, as was contemplated and provided in the granting act and resolution. In the asserted exercise \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 61]\n\u00a0\n of this right the company selected the lands in question. The particular losses on account of which the selection was made were such as to support it, the selection was made in conformity with the directions given by the Secretary of the Interior, and the lands selected were subject to selection unless rendered otherwise by a temporary executive withdrawal made about a year before. The local land officers accepted and approved the selection list and in transmitting it to the General Land Office called attention to the withdrawal. But when the Commissioner and the Secretary approved the selection and caused the patent to issue they overlooked the withdrawal and so did not consider or pass on its bearing on the company's right to select the lands. Five years later the matter was called to their attention and they caused this suit to be brought.\n The lands in question were not surveyed in the field until near 1905 and the plat of survey was not filed in the local land office until April 5, 1905. This indemnity selection was made later in the same day. On several occasions prior to 1904 the company had endeavored to select lands in the indemnity limits while they were as yet unsurveyed, or before the plat of the survey was filed in the local land office; but the Secretary of the Interior had refused to consider such selections and had directed that none be received until after the land was surveyed and the plat filed. Thus this selection was made as soon as was admissible under the Secretary's directions. The temporary executive withdrawal of the lands was made January 29, 1904, before they were surveyed, and was intended to prevent the acquisition of any claim to them pending an inquiry into the desirability of adding them, along with other lands, to an existing forest reserve. On March 7, 1906, they were added to the reserve by an executive proclamation.\n In its defense to the suit the company takes the position \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 62]\n\u00a0\n that the temporary withdrawal did not affect its right to select the lands and therefore that the United States was not prejudiced by the fact that the Commissioner and the Secretary overlooked the withdrawal when the selection was approved and the patent issued. In support of this position the company points to the stipulation on which the case was heard in the District Court wherein-following a reference to the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 376, 24 Stat. 556 (Comp. St.  4895-4900), directing the Secretary 'to immediately adjust' this and other railroad land grants, and to a special report of the Commissioner, made in 1906, purporting to show that the adjustment of this grant pursuant to that act had progressed to a point where it was disclosed there was a net deficiency in the grant of 4,092, 472.09 acres-it is said:\n'The plaintiff admits that when the withdrawal order of January 29, 1904, was issued, the lands patented to the defendant or its predecessor in interest within the primary and all indemnity limits, plus all other lands within the primary or place limits, not patented, but which passed under the grant, and also all odd-numbered sections in all indemnity limits which the defendant was entitled to select under the regulations of the Land Department did not equal the sum total of all the odd-numbered sections lying within the primary or place limits of the grant, and this condition still obtains; but the plaintiff does not admit that the correct measure of the grant is the aggregate area of all odd-numbered sections within the primary or place limits, or that any definite quantity of land was granted and guaranteed to the defendant by any of the acts of Congress making grants of land to the defendant or its predecessor or predecessors in interest.'\n\n And in further support of its position the company contends that where, through preemption and homestead entries or other disposals, the available lands in the indemnity limits have been so far diminished that those \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 63]\n\u00a0\n remaining are all needed to supply losses in the place limits the government is not at liberty to reserve the remaining lands, or any of them, for its own uses and thereby to cut off the company's right to claim them as indemnity, because, as against the government, they thenceforth are appropriated to the fulfillment of its obligation under the grant, and because the company has a vested right in the fulfillment of that obligation which all departments of the government are bound to respect. On the other hand, counsel for the government insist (a) that no right to lands in the indemnity limits attaches, either generally or specifically, until they are selected by the company; (b) that up to that time the government is free to reserve them for its own purposes and thereby to cut off the right of selection; and (c) that this is so even where the losses in the place limits exceed the available lands in the indemnity limits, and although the company's purpose to claim the latter be asserted at the earliest opportunity. The question thus presented has an important bearing on the further administration and adjustment of this grant, and perhaps of others, and counsel on both sides have dealt with it accordingly. In its present form the question is new, but the principles which must control its solution are well settled.\n The purpose of the granting act and resolution was to bring about the construction and operation of a line of railroad extending from Lake Superior to Puget Sound and Portland through what then consisted of great stretches of homeless prairies, trackless forests and unexplored mountains, and thus to facilitate the development of that region, promote commerce, and establish a convenient highway for the transportation of mails, troops, munitions and public stores to and from the Pacific Coast, with all the resultant advantages to the government and the public. To that end the act and resolution embodied a proposal to the company to the effect that if it would \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 64]\n\u00a0\n undertake and perform that vast work it should receive in return the lands comprehended in the grant. The company accepted the proposal and at enormous cost constructed the road and put the same in operation; and the road was accepted by the President. Thus the proposal was converted into a contract, as to which the company by performing its part became entitled to performance by the government. Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 679\n, 680 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 907. The provision relating to indemnity lands was as much a part of the grant and contract as the one relating to land in place (Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 U.S. 228\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 314, 65 L. Ed. --); and it is apparent from the granting act and resolution that 'it was the purpose of Congress in making the grant to confer a substantial right to land within the indemnity limits in lieu of lands lost within the place limits' (Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 387\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 300, 303). Such rights are within the protection of the due process of law clause of the Constitution. Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718.\n When the grant was made by the act and resolution it was thought that the indemnity limits as therein defined contained lands largely in excess of what would be required to supply losses within the place limits, and hence the provision in section 6 under which, as construed by the land officers and this court, all lands in the indemnity limits were to be and remain subject to the operation of the pre-emption and homestead laws, save as the odd-numbered sections should be taken out of their operation by indemnity selections. Under that provision, however, the lands available for indemnity were diminished much more rapidly than was expected; but as the provision was one of the terms of the grant the company must submit to whatever of disadvantage results from it. This the company frankly recognizes, for in its brief it says:\n'It was a part of our contract that, until selected, lands within the indemnity belt should be open to settlement under \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 65]\n\u00a0\n the homestead and pre-emption laws.'\n\n And also:\n'The question here is not whether in the face of the deficiency the settler [before selection] may acquire rights superior to ours, for we concede that he may.'\n\n But that provision gives no warrant for thinking that, after the company has earned the right to receive the lands comprehended in the grant, the government is free to reserve or appropriate to its own uses lands in the indemnity limits which are required to supply losses in the place limits. We say 'required' because we perceive no reason to doubt that lands in the indemnity limits may be so reserved or appropriated where what remains is sufficient to satisfy all the losses.\n While it often has been said that under such a grant no right attaches to any specific land within the indemnity limits until it is selected, an examination of the cases will show that this general rule never has been applied as between the government and the grantee where the lands available for indemnity were not sufficient for the purpose. Its only application has been where either the rights of settlers were involved, or the lands available for indemnity exceeded the losses, thereby making it essential that there be a selection and identification of the particular lands sought to be taken. This distinctions is illustrated in St. Paul and Pacific R. R. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. R. Co ., \n139 U.S. 1\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 389. The question there presented was whether there was any need for a selection where no right of a settler was involved and the lands available for indemnity were not sufficient to supply the losses. By reason of this insufficiency it was ruled that the lands in the indemnity limits necessarily were appropriated to satisfy the losses and that no selection was required. The court said ( \n139 U.S. 19\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 395):\n'As to the objection that no evidence was produced of any selection by the Secretary of the Interior from the indemnity lands to make up for the deficiencies found in the lands within the place \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 66]\n\u00a0\n limits, it is sufficient to observe that all the lands within the indemnity limits only made up in part for these deficiencies. There was, therefore, no occasion for the exercise of the judgment of the Secretary in selecting from them, for they were all appropriated.'\n\n That ruling related to the right to indemnity lands under this grant, and so is particularly in point; but it is well to observe that what was said about an existing deficiency related, as appears No. 139 U. S. on pages 8 and 9 of the opinion (11 Sup. Ct. 391), to the portion of the grant in Minnesota and not to other portions. This exception to the general rule that a selection is essential has been recognized by this court in other cases. United States v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry Co., \n141 \nU.S. 358, 376\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 13; United States v. Colton Marble & Lime Co., \n146 \nU.S. 615, 616\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 163; Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Bell, \n183 \nU.S. 675, 682\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 232.\n One of the regulations of the Land Department requires that indemnity selections be accompanied by a specification-tract for tract-of the losses on account of which they are made. But that department holds that this regulation does not apply where the losses exceed the lands which may be taken as indemnity. Thus in Hastings & Dakota Ry. Co., 19 Land Dec. 30, it was said by Secretary Smith:\n'The object in establishing the rule was to prevent the possibility of one basis of loss being used for more than one selection. As this grant is known to be deficient over 800,000 acres, ... the danger of a duplication of the losses does not exist; and the reason of the rule ceasing, the rule itself does not operate.'\n\n And a similar ruling is found in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wagner, 25 Land Dec. 458, 460, and other cases.\n Giving effect to all that bears on the subject, we are of opinion that after the company earned the right to receive what was intended by the grant it was not admissible for the government to reserve or appropriate to its own uses \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 67]\n\u00a0\n lands in the indemnity limits required to supply losses in the place limits. Of course, if it could take part of the lands required for that purpose, it could take all and thereby wholly defeat the provision for indemnity. But it cannot do either. The 'substantial right' conferred by that provision (Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, supra) cannot be thus cut down or extinguished (Sinking Fund Cases, supra).\n A more difficult question-to which only slight attention is given in the briefs-is whether it sufficiently appears from this record that the grant was deficient at the time of the temporary withdrawal; that is, that the lands available as indemnity were not then sufficient to supply the losses. The question is one the determination of which rests primarily with the Land Department. The stipulation on which the case was heard does not show that the department has determined the question, nor that it has refused to do so, but only that the question was not considered when this patent was issued, the withdrawal being then inadvertently overlooked. In these circumstances, to entitled either party to have the question determined in this suit the facts shown should make its right solution quite plain, for the decision might conclude both parties for all time-as respects other lands as well as those in suit. Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 18. Of course, the company is entitled to have the question considered and decided somewhere, and, if the deficiency be established, is entitled to have the selection of these lands sustained. A third of a century already has elapsed since the company earned the right to receive what was intended by the grant.\n Two matters stated in the stipulation are relied upon as showing a deficiency. One is that in 1906 the Commissioner reported to the Secretary that the adjustment of the grant had progressed to a point where it was disclosed \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 68]\n\u00a0\n that there was a net deficiency of 4,092,472.09 acres. By the act of March 3, 1887, supra, the supervision of the adjustment was specially devolved on the Secretary, and yet the stipulation does not show that he approved the Commissioner's report or in any way recognized it as correct. We think the report, in the absence of any confirmatory action by the Secretary, cannot be taken as sufficiently establishing that a deficiency existed. The other statement is that at the time of the temporary withdrawal all the lands theretofore received by the company plus all that it was possible for it to receive thereafter, whether as place lands or indemnity lands, did not equal 'the sum total of all the odd-numbered sections lying within the primary or place limits,' and that condition still obtains. But the statement also says that the government 'does not admit that the correct measure of the grant is the aggregate area of all odd-numbered sections within the primary or place limits.' What was meant by this qualification is not otherwise disclosed; nor is it explained in the briefs. The aggregate of the odd-numbered sections within the place limits is the correct measure of the grant, unless (a) part of the grant included only a moiety of those sections,1 or (b) the route of this road and that of another with a prior land grant were found to be upon the same general line, in which event a stated deduction was to be made from the amount of land granted to this company. \n2\n There would be no right to indemnity as respects the moiety not included, nor as \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 69]\n\u00a0\n respects the lands required to be deducted. Either of those conditions, if existing, would affect the measure of the grant and would have to be considered in determining whether there was a deficiency. The stipulation does not show the presence or the absence of either condition, and the matter is not one of which courts take judicial notice. Therefore the actual situation, whatever it may have been, should have been shown. As this was not done, neither party is entitled to have the question whether there was a deficiency determined upon the present record.\n Turning to the published decisions of the Land Department, we find that in Hessey v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 43 Land Dec. 302, the Secretary distinctly declared that the grant was so far deficient that many losses within the place limits must remain unsatisfied, and therefore that compliance with a provision that indemnity selections be made from lands nearest the line of the road was no longer required. But as that finding apparently related to the situation existing December 9, 1909, it cannot be taken as showing that there was a deficiency almost six years before, when the temporary withdrawal now in question was made. The situation may have changed materially in the meantime, for doubtless large numbers of homestead entries were being made within the indemnity limits every year.\n We conclude that the decrees below must be reversed and the suit remanded to the District Court with directions (a) to accord the parties a reasonable opportunity, on a further hearing, to supplement and perfect the showing made in the present record, if either or both are so disposed; ( b) if the parties avail themselves of that opportunity, to proceed to an adjudication of the suit upon the record as thus supplemented; and (c) if the parties do not avail themselves of that opportunity, to enter a decree canceling the patent without prejudice to the right of the company to have the question of the asserted deficiency \n\n[256 U.S. 51, 70]\n\u00a0\n in the grant determined by the Land Department and to have the present selection sustained and given full effect, if the grant was deficient when the temporary withdrawal was made.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Southern Pacific R.

C., and Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n After a hearing on September 22, 1917, by the Third Assistant Postmaster General, of the time and character of which the relator ( plaintiff in error) had due notice and at which it was represented by its president, an order was entered, revoking the second-class mail privilege granted to it in 1911 as publisher of the Milwaukee Leader. So far as appears, all that the relator desired to say or offer was heard and received. This hearing was had and \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n the order was entered upon the charge that articles were appearing in relator's paper so violating the provisions of the National Defense Law, approved June 15, 1917, which has come to be popularly known as the Espionage Act of Congress (40 Stat. 217), as to render it 'nonmailable' by the express terms of title 12 of that act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10401a-10401d). On appeal to the Postmaster General the order was approved. Thereupon the relator filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, praying that a writ of mandamus issue, commanding the Postmaster General to annul his order and restore the paper to the second-class privilege. To a rule to show cause the Postmaster General answered, and a demurrer to his answer being overruled, and the relator not pleading further, the court discharged the rule and dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and, the constitutional validity of laws of the United States being involved, the case was brought here by writ of error.\n The grounds upon which the relator relies are, in substance, that to the extent that the Espionage Act confers power upon the Postmaster General to make the order entered against it, that act is unconstitutional, because it does not afford relator a trial in a court of competent jurisdiction; that the order deprives relator of the right of free speech, is destructive of the rights of a free press, and deprives it of its property without due process of law.\n That a hearing, such as was accorded the relator, on precisely such a question as is here involved, when fairly conducted, satisfies all of the requirements of due process of law, has been repeatedly decided.

Ct. 867\n\n\n Since the petition in this case was filed, it has also become settled that the Espionage Act is a valid, constitutional \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n law. Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249; Debs v. United States, \n249 U.S. 211\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 252; Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 17.\n The first comprehensive law providing for the classification of mails was enacted on March 3, 1879 (20 Stat. 355). From that time to this, mail classification, frequently approved by this court, has dealt only with 'mailable matter.' In section 7 of that act (Comp. St.  7302), still in effect, 'mailable matter' is divided into four classes, and by section 10 ( Comp. St.  7304) the second class of such 'mailable matter' is defined as including newspapers and periodicals. By section 1 of title 12 of the act of June 15, 1917, supra (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10401a), any newspaper violating any provision of the act is declared to be 'nonmailable matter,' which shall 'not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.'\n The extremely low rate charged for second-class mail-to carry it was said, in argument, to cost seven times the revenue which it yields-is justified as a part of 'the historic policy of encouraging by low postal rates the dissemination of current intelligence.' It is a frank extension of special favors to publishers because of the special contribution to the public welfare which Congress believes is derived from the newspaper and other periodical press. \n229 \nU.S. 301, 304\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 867.\n By now more than 40 years of departmental practice, admission to the privilege of this second-class mail has been obtained for a publication only by a permit, issued by the Postmaster General after a hearing and upon a showing made, satisfactory to him, or his authorized assistants, that it contains and will continue to contain only mailable matter and that it will meet the various statutory and other requirements. Houghton v. Payne, \n194 \nU.S. 88, 94\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 590.\n That the power to suspend or revoke such second-class privilege was a necessary incident to the power to grant it has long been recognized by statute and by many decisions \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n of this court. 31 Stat. 1107; Smith v. Hitchcock, \n226 \nU.S. 53, 57\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 6; Houghton v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 88\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 590; Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 595. Under these statutes and decisions, if the newspaper of the relator had come to be so edited that it contained other than 'mailable matter,' plainly it was the intention of Congress that it should no longer be carried as second-class mail and therefore the order to revoke the permit which had been granted to relator was proper and justified; and that it had become so changed in character is the holding of the Postmaster General and of the two lower courts which we are reviewing.\n For the purpose of preventing disloyalty and disunion among our people of many origins, and to the end that a united front should be presented to the enemy, the Espionage Act, one of the first of the national defense laws enacted by Congress after the entry of the United States into the World War (approved June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 217), provided severe punishment for any person who 'when the United States is at war' shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation and success of the military or naval forces of the country, or with the intent to promote the success of its enemies, or who shall cause, or attempt to cause, insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty in such forces, or who shall willfully obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States (section 3, tit. 1 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10212c]). One entire title of this act (title 12) is devoted to 'Use of the Mails,' and in the exercise of its practically plenary power over the mails (Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n; Public Clearing House v. Coyne, \n194 \nU.S. 497, 506\n, 507 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 789; Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, \n229 \nU.S. 288, 313\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 867) Congress therein provided that any newspaper published in violation of any of the provisions of the act should be 'nonmailable' and should not be 'conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.' \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n It was under the provisions of this wartime act and under the specific injunction of section 396 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  582), declaring it to be the duty of the Postmaster General to 'superintend generally all the business of the [Post Office] Department and to execute all laws relating to the postal service,' that the order in this case was entered.\n The Postmaster General avers that, upon the hearing which we have described, he found, that beginning within a week after the declaration of war against the German Government and continuing to the date of the revocation of the second-class privilege herein, the relator had published in its newspaper frequently, often daily, articles which contained false reports and false statements, published with intent to interfere with the success of the military operations of our government, to promote the success of its enemies, and to obstruct its recruiting and enlistment service. For this cause, exercising the power which we have seen had been invested in the Postmaster General by statute for almost 40 years, and which had frequently been exercised by his predecessors, the respondent revoked the scond-class privilege which had been granted to the relator. A similar executive authority with respect to matters within their jurisdiction has been given to the heads of all the great departments of our government and is constantly exercised by them.\n This is neither a dangerous nor an arbitrary power, as was argued at the bar, for it is not only subject to review by the courts (the claim of the relator was heard and rejected by two courts before this re- examination of it in this court), but it is also subject to control by Congress and by the President of the United States. Under that Constitution, which we shall find it vehemently denouncing, the rights of the relator were, and are, amply protected by the opportunity thus given it to resort for relief to all three departments of the government, if those rights \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n should be invaded by any ruling of the Postmaster General.\n All this being settled law, there remains the question whether substantial evidence to support his order may be found in the facts stated in the Postmaster General's answer, which are admitted by the demurrer; for the law is that the conclusion of the head of an executive department of the government on such a question, when within his jurisdiction, will not be disturbed by the courts, unless they are clearly of the opinion that it is wrong. Smith v. Hitchcock, \n226 \nU.S. 53, 60\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 6; Houston v. St. Louis, etc., Packing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 479, 484\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 332, and cases cited.\n In the answer of the Postmaster General there were quoted more than 50 excerpts from editorial articles which appeared in relator's newspaper at intervals between April 14 and September 13, 1917-the first five months after our country entered the Great War-upon consideration of which, with others not reproduced, he averred, his order was based.\n Without going much into detail: It was declared in the quoted articles that the war was unjustifiable and dishonorable on our part, a capitalistic war, which had been forced upon the people by a class, to serve its selfish ends. Our government was denounced as a 'plutocratic republic,' a financial and political autocracy, and resident Russians were praised for defaming it. Other articles denounced the draft law as unconstitutional, arbitrary, and oppressive, with the implied counsel that it should not be respected or obeyed, and it was represented that soldiers in France were becoming insane in such numbers that long trains of closed cars were being used to convey them away from the battle front. It was confidently asserted that the Constitution of the United States was purposely made difficult of amendment, in order that we might not have real democracy in this country, the President was denounced \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 414]\n\u00a0\n as an autocrat, and the war legislation as having been passed by a 'rubber stamp Congress.' In the guise of argument these articles sought to convince the readers of them that soldiers could not legally be sent outside the country, and that our government was waging a war of conquest, when Germany was ready to make an honorable peace. The Food Control Law was denounced as 'Kaiserizing America.' It was declared that we were fighting for commercial supremacy and world domination only, and that when the 'financial kings' concluded that further fighting might endanger their loans to the Allies they would move for peace, which would quickly come. Our 'Allies' were repeatedly condemned and our enemies frequently praised.\n These publications were not designed to secure amendment or repeal of the laws denounced in them as arbitrary and oppressive, but to create hostility to, and to encourage violation of them. Freedom of the press may protect criticism and agitation for modification or repeal of laws, but it does not extend to protection of him who counsels and encourages the violation of the law as it exists. The Constitution was adopted to preserve our government, not to serve as a protecting screen for those who, while claiming its privileges, seek to destroy it.\n Without further discussion of the articles, we cannot doubt that they conveyed to readers of them false reports and false statements, with intent to promote the success of the enemies of the United States, and that they constituted a willful attempt to cause disloyalty and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces, and to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States, in violation of the Espionage Law ( Schenck v. United States, Frohwerk v. United States, and Debs v. United States, supra), and that therefore their publication brought the paper containing them within the express terms of title 12 of that law, declaring that such a publication shall be \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 415]\n\u00a0\n 'nonmailable' and 'shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.'\n While written more adroitly than the usual pro-German propaganda of that time, they nevertheless prove clearly that the publisher of these articles was deliberately and persistently doing all in its power to deter its readers from supporting the war in which our government was engaged and to induce them to lend aid and comfort to its enemies. The order of the Postmaster General not only finds reasonable support in this record, but is amply justified by it.\n We shall notice further only the contention that if it should be found that the Postmaster General had authority to revoke the second-class privilege as to a single issue of the paper, nevertheless he did not have power to make such an order applicable to the indefinite future.\n The second-class privilege ever since 1879 has been granted to a newspaper, as we have seen, only on application of its publisher for entry of it to that class. Upon such an application, a searching investigation of the character of the publication is made by the Postmaster General, under rules and regulations prescribed by him, which experience has proved necessary to prevent frauds upon the government (United States Postal Laws and Regulations 1913,  411-435, inclusive; \n229 U.S. 306\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 867), and two representative copies of the issue nearest to the date of the application are required to be filed. If the publication is found to be entitled to the second-class privilege, a permit to that effect is issued, which contains, as did the permit to the relator, the provision that 'the authority herein given is revocable upon determination by the department that the publication does not conform to law.' Such a permit, however, would be equally revocable without any such specific reservation. 31 Stat. 1107; Smith v. Hitchcock, \n226 \nU.S. 53, 60\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 6. \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 416]\n\u00a0\n It is a reasonable presumption that the character of the publication as one entitled to the second-class privilege, when thus established, will continue to be substantially maintained, and therefore such a permit is made applicable to the indefinite future. For the same reason, and because it would not be practicable to examine each issue of a newspaper, the revocation of a permit must continue until further order. Government is a practical institution, adapted to the practical conduct of public affairs. It would not be possible for the United States to maintain a reader in every newspaper office of the country, to approve in advance each issue before it should be allowed to enter the mails, and when, for more than five months, a paper had contained, almost daily, articles which, under the express terms of the statute, rendered it 'nonmailable,' it was reasonable to conclude that it would continue its disloyal publications, and it was therefore clearly within the power given to the Postmaster General by R. S.  396, 'to execute all laws relating to the postal service,' to enter, as was done in this case, an order suspending the privilege until a proper application and showing should be made for its renewal. The order simply withdrew from the relator the second-class privilege, but did not exclude its paper from other classes, as it might have done, and there was nothing in it to prevent reinstatement at any time. It was open to the relator to mend its ways, to publish a paper conforming to the law, and then to apply anew for the second-class mailing privilege. This it did not do, but for reasons not difficult to imagine, it preferred this futile litigation, undertaken upon the theory that a government competent to wage war against its foreign enemies was powerless against its insidious foes at home. Whatever injury the relator suffered was the result of its own choice and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n This case arose during the Would War; but it presents no legal question peculiar to war. It is important, because what we decide may determine in large measure whether in times of peace our press shall be free.\n The denial to a newspaper of entry as second-class mail, or the revocation of an entry previously made, does not deny to the paper admission to the mail; nor does it deprive the publisher of any mail facility. It merely deprives him of the very low postal rates, called second-class, and compels him to pay postage for the same service at the rate called third-class, which was, until recently, from 8 to 15 times as high as the second-class rate. \n1\n Such is the nature and the only effect of an order denying or revoking the entry. See Postal Laws and Regulations,  421, 422, and 423. In this case entry to the second-class mail was revoked because the paper had, in the opinion of the Postmaster General, systematically inserted editorials and news items which he deemed unmailable. The question presented is: Did Congress confer upon the Postmaster General authority to deny second-class postal rates on that ground? The question is one of statutory construction. No such authority is granted in terms in the statutes which declare what matter shall be unmailable. Is there any provision of the postal laws from which the intention of Congress to grant such power may be inferred? The specific reason why the Postmaster General deemed these editorials and news items unmailable was that he considered them violative of title 12 of the Espionage Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10401a-10401d ). But it is not contended that this specific reason is of \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 418]\n\u00a0\n legal significance. The scope of the Postmaster General's alleged authority is confessedly the same whether the reason for the nonmailable quality of the matter inserted in a newspaper is that it violates the Espionage Act, or the copyright laws, or that it is part of a scheme to defraud, or concerns lotteries, or is indecent, or is in any other respect matter which Congress has declared shall not be admitted to the mails. \n2\n The question of the scope of the Postmaster General's power is presented to us on the following record:\n Some years prior to 1917 the Milwaukee Leader, a daily newspaper published by the Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Company, made application to use the second-class mail, was declared entitled to do so, and thereafter used it continuously. It built up a large circulation, of which about 9,000 copies were distributed daily through the second-class mail. In September, 1917, its publisher was directed to show cause--\n'why the authorization of admission ... to the second-class mail ( matter) should not be revoked upon the following ground:\n\n'The publication is not 'a newspaper or other periodical publication' within the meaning of the law governing mailable matter of the second class, it being in conflict with the provisions of the law embodied in section 481 1\/2, Postal Laws and Regulations.' \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 419]\n\u00a0\n That section relates, not specifically to the second-class mail, but to all mail. It recites the provisions of title 12 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 230, which declares unmailable all letters, pictures, publications and things 'in violation of any of the provisions' of that act, and prescribes fine and imprisonment as punishment for the use or attempt to use the postal service for the transmission of such unmailable matter. \n3\n On this notice to show cause the Third Assistant Postmaster General held the customary informal hearing. The publisher of the Milwaukee Leader had not been convicted by any court of violating the Espionage Law; and its representative denied that it had ever committed any act in violation of it. But the Third Assistant Postmaster General issued on October 3, 1917, to the postmaster at Milwaukee the instruction that the Milwaukee Leader--\n\n'is not entitled to transmission in the mail at second-class rates of postage because it appears from the evidence in possession of the department that the publication is not a 'newspaper or other periodical publication' within the meaning of the law governing mailable matter of the second class, it being in conflict with the provisions of the law embodied in section 481 1\/2, Postal Laws and Regulations.'\n\n This determination and action were confirmed by the Postmaster General, and the postmaster at Milwaukee thereafter denied to the publication transmission at the rates privided by law for second-class mail. The order did not forbid to the Milwaukee Leader all use of the mails, nor did it limit in any way the use of the mail facilities. It merely revoked the so-called second-class mailing permit, and the effect of this was to impose a \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 420]\n\u00a0\n higher rate of postage on every copy of the newspaper thereafter mailed.\n The return filed herein by the Postmaster General alleges that this order 'involved the exercise of judgment and discretion on his part,' and is 'not subject to be reviewed, set aside, or controlled by a court of law'; but he gives this justification for his action:\n'By representations and complaints from sundry good and loyal citizens of the United States and from personal reading and consideration of the issues of the said relator's publication, from the date of the declaration of war down to the time of the service of the citation upon it and the hearing granted in pursuance thereof, it seemed to this respondent in the exercise of his judgment and discretion and in obedience to the duty on him reposed, as well by the general statutes as by the special provisions of said Espionage Law, that the provisions of the latter act were systematically and continually violated by the relator's publication.'\n\n It thus appears that the Postmaster General, in the exercise of a supposed discretion, refused to carry at second-class mail rates all future issues of the Milwaukee Leader, solely because he believed it had systematically violated the Espionage Act in the past. It further appears that this belief rested partly upon the contents of past issues of the paper filed with the return and partly upon 'representations and complaints from sundry good and loyal citizens,' whose statements are not incorporated in this record and which do not appear to have been called to the attention of the publisher of the Milwaukee Leader at the hearing or otherwise. It is this general refusal thereafter to accept the paper for transmission at the second-class mail rates which is challenged as being without warrant in law.\n In discussing whether Congress conferred upon the Postmaster General the authority which he undertook to exercise \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 421]\n\u00a0\n this case, I shall consider, first, whether he would have had the power to exclude the paper altogether from all future mail service on the ground alleged; and, second, whether he had power to deny the publisher the second-class rate.\n First. Power to exclude from the mails has never been conferred in terms upon the Postmaster General. Beginning with the Act of March 3, 1865, c. 89,  16, 13 Stat. 507, relating to obscene matter and the Act of July 27, 1868, c. 246,  13, 15 Stat. 196, concerning lotteries, Congress has from time to time forbidden the deposit in the mails of certain matter. In each instance, in addition to prescribing fine and imprisonment as a punishment for sending or attempting to send the prohibited matter through the mail, it declared that such matter should not be conveyed in the mail, nor delivered from any post office nor by any letter carrier. \n4\n By section 6 of the Act of June 8, 1872 (Rev. Stat. 396 [Comp. St.  582]), the Postmaster General was empowered to 'superintend ... the business of the department, and execute all laws relative to the postal service.' As a matter of administration the Postmaster General, through his subordinates, rejects matter offered for mailing, or removes matter already in the mail, which in his judgment is unmailable. The existence in the Postmaster General of the power to do this cannot be doubted. The only question which can arise is whether in the individual case the power has been illegally exercised. \n5\n But while he may \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 422]\n\u00a0\n thus exclude from the mail specific matter which he deems of the kind declared by Congress to be unmailable, he may not, either as a preventive measure or as a punishment, order that in the future mail tendered by a particular person or the future issues of a particular paper shall be refused transmission.\n Until recently, at least, this appears never to have been questioned and the Post Office Department has been authoritatively advised that the power of excluding matter from the mail was limited to such specific matter as upon examination was found to be unmailable and that the Postmaster General could not make an exclusion order operative upon future issues of a newspaper.\n In 1890 Tolstoi's Kreutzer Sonata had been excluded from the mails as indecent. Certain newspapers began to publish the book in installments and their position was referred to the Attorney General. He replied:\n'... I do not see that it necessarily follows that every installment of the story thus published is obscene, because the story as a whole is declared to be so. It may be, indeed, that one or more chapters of this story are entirely unexceptionable in character. If so, the exclusion, as unmailable, of newspapers containing them might involve serious consequences to yourself.' 19 Op. Atty. Gen. 667, 668.\n\n Again, in 1908, President Roosevelt asked the Attorney General if the law permitted him to deny the mails to an anarchist newspaper published in the Italian language, in which appeared articles advocating the murder of the police force of Patterson and the burning of the city. The Attorney General advised him that such an article constituted a seditious libel (it has since been made criminal by statute-Act of March 4, 1911, c. 241,  2 [ Comp. St.  10381]), and that--\n'The Postmaster General [would] be justified in excluding from the mails any issue of any periodical, otherwise entitled to the privilege of second-class mail \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 423]\n\u00a0\n matter, which shall contain any article constituting a seditious libel and counseling such crimes as murder, arson, riot, and treason.' 26 Op. Atty. Gen. 555.\n\n But the Attorney General was careful to point out that the law gave no authority to exclude issues of the paper which should contain no objectionable matter:\n'It must be premised that the Postmaster General clearly has no power to close the mails to any class of persons, however reprehensible may be their practices or however detestable their reputation; if the question were whether the mails could be closed to all issues of a newspaper, otherwise entitled to admission, by reason of an article of this kind in any particular issue, there could be no doubt that the question must be answered in the negative.' Page 565.\n\n If such power were possessed by the Postmaster General, he would, in view of the practical finality of his decisions, become the universal censor of publications. For a denial of the use of the mail would be for most of them, tantamount to a denial of the right of circulation. Congress has not granted to the Postmaster General power to deny the right of sending matter by mail even to one who has been convicted by a jury and sentenced by a court for unlawful use of the mail and who has been found by the Postmaster General to have been habitually using the mail for frauds or lotteries and is likely to do so in the future. It has, in order to protect the public, directed postmasters to return to the sender mail addressed to one found by the Postmaster General to be engaged in a scheme to defraud or in a lottery enterprise. \n6\n But beyond this Congress has never \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 424]\n\u00a0\n deemed it wise, if, indeed, it has considered it constitutional, to interfere with the civil right of using the mail for lawful purposes. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The Postmaster General does not claim here the power to issue an order directly denying a newspaper all mail service for the future. \n8\n Indeed, he asserts that the mail \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 425]\n\u00a0\n is still open to the Milwaukee Leader upon payment of first, third, or fourth class rates. He contends, however, that in regard to second-class rates special provisions of law apply under which he may deny that particular rate at his discretion. This contention will now be considered.\n Second. The second-class mail rate is confined to newspapers and other periodicals, which possess the qualifications and comply with the conditions prescribed by Congress. \n9\n In the present case the Postmaster General insists that by reason of alleged past violations of title 12 of the Espionage Act, two of the conditions had ceased to be fulfilled. His reasons are these: The Mail Classification Act of March 3, 1879, c. 180, 20 Stat. 358, provides by section 14 (Comp. St.  7306) that a newspaper to be mailable at the second-class rates 'must be regularly issued at stated intervals as frequently \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 426]\n\u00a0\n as four times a year,' and that it must be 'originated and published for the dissemination of information of a public character.' If any issue of a paper has contained matter violative of the Espionage Act, the paper is no longer 'regularly issued'; and likewise it has ceased to be a paper 'published for the dissemination of information of a public character.' \n10\n The argument is obviously unsound. The requirement that the newspaper be 'regularly issued' refers, not to the propriety of the reading matter, but to the fact that publication periodically at stated intervals must be intended and that the intention must be carried out. Similarly, the requirement that the paper be 'published for the dissemination of information of a public character' refers not to the reliability of the information or the soundness of the opinions expressed therein, but to the general character of the publication. The Classification Act does not purport to deal with the effect of, or the punishment for, crimes committed through a publication. It simply provides rates and classifies the material which may be sent at the respective rates. The act says what shall \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 427]\n\u00a0\n constitute a newspaper. Undoubtedly the Postmaster General has latitude of judgment in deciding whether a publication meets the definition of a newspaper laid down by the law, but the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether the reasons which an administrative officer gives for his actions agree with the requirements of the statute under which he purports to act. Gegiow v. Uhl, \n239 U.S. 36\n Sup. Ct. 2; American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 33. The fact that material appearing in a newspaper is unmailable under wholly different provisions of law can have no effect on whether or not the publication is a newspaper. Although it violates the law, it remains a newspaper. If it is a bad newspaper, the act which makes it illegal, and not the Classification Act, provides the punishment.\n There is also presented, in brief and argument, a much broader claim in support of the action of the Postmaster General. It is insisted that a citizen uses the mail at second-class rates, not as of right, but by virtue of a privilege or permission, the granting of which rests in the discretion of the Postmaster General. Because the payment made for this governmental service is less than it costs, it is assumed that a properly qualified person has not the right to the service so long as it is offered, and may not complain if it is denied to him. The service is called the second-class privilege. The certificate evidencing such freedom is spoken of as a permit. But, in fact, the right to the lawful postal rates is a right independent of the discretion of the Postmaster General. The right and conditions of its existence are defined and rest wholly upon mandatory legislation of Congress. It is the duty of the Postmaster General to determine whether the conditions prescribed for any rate exist. This determination in the case of the second-class rate may involve more subjects of inquiry, some of them, perhaps, of greater difficulty, than in cases of other rates. But the function of the Postmaster General is the \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 428]\n\u00a0\n same in all cases. In making the determination he must, like a court or a jury, form a judgment whether certain conditions prescribed by Congress exist, on controverted facts or by applying the law. The function is a strictly judicial one, although exercised in administering an executive office. \n11\n And it is not a function which either involves or permits the exercise of discretionary power. The socalled permit is mere formal notice of his judgment, but indispensable to the publisher because without it the local postmaster will not transmit the publication at second-class rates. The same sort of permit is necessary for the same bulk service at first, third or fourth-class rates. \n12\n There is nothing, in short, about the second-class rate which furnishes the slightest basis in law for differentiating it from the other rates so far as the discretion of the Postmaster General to grant or withhold it is concerned.\n Third. Such is the legislation of Congress. It clearly appears that there was no express grant of power to the Postmaster General to deny second-class mail rates to future issues of a newspaper because in his opinion it had systematically violated the Espionage Act in the past, and it seems equally clear that there is no basis for the contention \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 429]\n\u00a0\n that such power is to be implied. In respect to newspapers mailed by a publisher at second-class rates there is clearly no occasion to imply this drastic power. \n13\n For a publisher must deposit with the local postmaster, before the first mailing of every issue, a copy of the publication which is now examined for matter subject to a higher rate and in order to determine the portion devoted to advertising. Act of March 3, 1879, c. 180 ,  12, 20 Stat. 359 (Comp. St.  7305); Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,  1101, 40 Stat. 327 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  7358a). If there is illegal material in the newspaper, here is ample opportunity to discover it and remove the paper from the mail. Indeed, of the four classes of mail, it is the second alone which affords to the postal official full opportunity of ascertaining, before deposit in the mail, whether that which it is proposed to transmit is mailable matter. But even if the statutes were less clear in this respect than they seem to me, I should be led to adopt that construction because of the familiar rule that --\n'Where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.' United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 408\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527, 536 (53 L. Ed. 836).\n\n For adoption of the construction urged by the Postmaster General would raise not only a grave question, but a 'succession of constitutional doubts,' as suggested in Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 \nU.S. 407, 422\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 115, 119. It would in practice seriously abridge the free dom \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 430]\n\u00a0\n of the press. Would it not also violate the First Amendment? It would in practice deprive many publishers of their property without due process of law. would it not also violate the Fifth Amendment? It would in practice subject publishers to punishment without a hearing by any court. Would it not also violate article 3 of the Constitution? It would in practice subject publishers to severe punishment for an infamous crime without trial by jury. Would it not also violate the Sixth Amendment? And the punishment inflicted-denial of a civil right-is certainly unusual. Would it also violate the Eighth Amendment? If the construction urged by the Postmaster General is rejected, these questions need not be answered; but it seems appropriate to indicate why the doubts raised by them are grave.\n\n\n (a)\n The power to police the mails is an incident of the postal power. Congress may, of course, exclude from the mails matter which is dangerous or which carries on its face immoral expressions, threats, or libels. It may go further, and through its power of exclusion exercise, within limits, general police power over the material which it carries, even though its regulations are quite unrelated to the business of transporting mails. In re Rapier, \n143 U.S. 110\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 374; Lewis Pub. Co. v. Morgan, \n229 U.S. 288\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 867. As stated in Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 732 (24 L. Ed. 877):\n'The difficulty attending the subject arises, not from the want of power in Congress to prescribe regulations as to what shall constitute mail matter, but from the necessity of enforcing them consistently with rights reserved to the people, of far greater importance than the transportation of the mail.'\n\n In other words, the postal power, like all its other powers, is subject to the limitations of the Bill of Rights. Burton v.United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 371\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 688, 6 Ann. Cas. 362. Compare Adair v. United States, \n208 U.S. 161\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764. Congress may not through its postal police power put limitations upon the freedom of the press which, if directly attempted, would be unconstitutional. \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 431]\n\u00a0\n This court also stated in Ex parte Jackson, that--\n'Liberty of circulating is as essential to that freedom as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be of little value.'\n\n It is argued that, although a newspaper is barred from the second- class mail, liberty of circulation is not denied, because the first and third-class mail and also other means of transportation are left open to a publisher. Constitutional rights should not be frittered away by arguments so technical and unsubstantial. 'The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows. Its inhibition was leveled at the thing, not the name.' Cummings v. State of Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (18 L. Ed. 356). The government might, of course, decline altogether to distribute newspapers, or it might decline to carry any at less than the cost of the service, and it would not thereby abridge the freedom of the press, since to all papers other means of transportation would be left open. But to carry newspapers generally at a sixth of the cost of the service, and to deny that service to one paper of the same general character, because to the Postmaster General views therein expressed in the past seem illegal, would prove an effective censorship and abridge seriously freedom of expression. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n How dangerous to liberty of the press would be the \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 432]\n\u00a0\n holding that the second-class mail service merely a privilege, which Congress may deny to those whose views it deems to be against public policy, is shown by the following contention made in 1912 by the Solicitor General in the Lewis Case (See Brief, pp. 46, 47):\n'A possible abuse of power is no argument against its existence, but we may as well observe that a denial of the mails to a paper because of its ownership or the views held by its owners may well be illegal as having no relation to the thing carried in the mails unless the views are expressed in the paper; but if such views are expressed in the paper Congress can doubtless exclude them, just as Congress could now exclude all papers advocating lotteries, prohibition, anarchy, or a protective tariff if a majority of Congress thought such views against public policy.' (Italics in the original.)15\n\n\n (b)\n The right which Congress has given to all properly circumstanced persons to distribute newspapers and periodicals through the mails is a substantial right. Hoover v. McChesney (C. C.) 81 Fed. 472; Payne v. Nat. Ry. Pub. Co., 20 App. D. C. 581; Id. \n192 U.S. 602\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 849. It is of the same nature as-indeed, it is a part of-the right to carry on business whcih this court has been jealous to protect against what it has considered arbitrary deprivations. Adair v. United States, \n208 U.S. 161\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764; Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960; Adams v. Tanner, \n244 U.S. 590\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427. A law by which certain publishers were unreasonably or arbitrarily denied the low rates would deprive them of liberty or property without due process of law; and it \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 433]\n\u00a0\n would likewise deny them equal protection of the laws. Compare Second Employers' Liability Cases. \n223 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 53 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. The court might hold that a statute which conferred upon the Postmaster General the power to do this, because of supposed past infractions of law, was unreasonable and arbitrary; particularly in respect to second-class mail which affords ample opportunity for preventing the transmission of unmailable matter; and hence obnoxious to the Fifth Amendment.\n The contention that, because the rates are noncompensatory, use of the second-class mail is not a right, but a privilege, which may be granted or withheld at the pleasure of Congress, rests upon an entire misconception, when applied to individual members of a class. The fact that it is largely gratuitous makes clearer its position as a right; for it is paid for by taxation. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n (c)\n The order revoking the entry of the Milwaukee Leader to second- class mail was clearly a punitive, not a preventive, measure, as all classes of mail except the second were, as the Postmaster General states, left open to it, provided it had sufficient financial resources. Of \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 434]\n\u00a0\n the three left available, the third class, being for 'miscellaneous printed matter,' was an appropriate one for distributing newspapers and was the cheapest. But the additional cost to the publisher involved in distributing daily 9,000 copies, by the third-class mail would be a very serious one. The actual and intended effect of the order was merely to impose a very heavy fine, possibly $150 a day, for supposed transgression in the past. But the trial and punishment of crimes is a function which the Constitution (article 3,  2, cl. 3) intrusts to the judiclary. \n17\n I am not aware that any other civil administrative officer has assumed, in any country in which the common law prevails, the power to inflict upon a citizen severe punishment for an infamous crime. Possibly the court would hold that Congress could not, in view of article 3 of the Constitution, confer upon the Postmaster General, as a mere incident in the administration of his department, authority to issue an order which could operate only as a punishment. See Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 U.S. 228\n, 235-237, 16 Sup. Ct. 977.\n\n\n (d)\n The Sixth Amendment guarantees that, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, and that he shall be confronted with the witnesses against him. It is only in the case of petty offenses that the jury may be dispensed with. Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 68\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 826, 1 Ann. Cas. 585. What is in effect a very heavy fine has been imposed by the Postmaster General. It has been imposed because he finds that the publisher has committed the crime of violating the Espionage Act. And that finding is based in part upon 'representations and complaints from sundry good and loyal citizens' \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 435]\n\u00a0\n WITH WHOM THE PUBLISHER WAS NOT CONFRONTEd. it may be that the court would hold, in view of article 6 in our Bill of Rights, that Congress is without power to confer upon the Postmaster General, or even upon a court, except upon the verdict of a jury and upon confronting the accused with the witnesses against him, authority to inflict indirectly such a substantial punishment as this. See Callan v. Wilson, \n127 U.S. 540\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1301; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 U.S. 343\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 620.\n\n\n (e)\n The punishment inflicted is not only unusual in character; it is, so far as known, unprecedented in American legal history. Every fine imposed by a court is definite in amount. \n18\n Every fine prescribed by Congress is limited in amount. Statutes frequently declare that each day's continuation of an offense shall constitute a new crime. But here a fine imposed for a past offense is made to grow indefinitely each day-perhaps throughout the life of the publication. Already, having grown at the rate of say $150 a day, it may aggregate, if the circulation has been maintained, about $180,000 for the 3 years and 4 months since the order was entered; and its growth continues. It was assumed in Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1) \n212 \nU.S. 86, 111\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 220, that an excessive fine, even if definite, would violate the Eighth Amendment. Possibly the court, applying the Eighth Amendment, might again, as in Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 381\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 544, 554 (54 L. Ed. 793, 19 Ann. Cas. 705), make clear the 'difference between unrestrained power and that which is exercised under the spirit of constitutional limitations formed to establish justice.'\n The suggestion is made that, if a new application for entry to second- class mail had been made, the publishers might have been granted a certificate. It is no bar to proceedings to set aside an illegal sentence that an application \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 436]\n\u00a0\n to the executive for clemency might have resulted in a pardon.\n In conclusion I say again-because it cannot be stressed too strongly- that the power here claimed is not a war power. There is no question of its necessity to protect the country from insidious domestic foes. To that end Congress conferred upon the Postmaster General the enormous power contained in the Espionage Act of entirely excluding from the mails any letter, picture or publication which contained matter violating the broad terms of that act. But it did not confer-and the Postmaster General concedes that it did not confer-the vague and absolute authority practically to deny circulation to any publication which in his opinion is likely to violate in the future any postal law. The grant of that power is construed into a postal rate statute passed 40 years ago which has never before been suspected of containing such implications. I cannot believe that in establishing postal classifications in 1879 Congress intended to confer upon the Postmaster General authority to issue the order here complained of. If, under the Constitution, administrative officers may, as a mere incident of the peace time administration of their departments, be vested with the power to issue such orders as this, there is little of substance in our Bill of Rights, and in every extension of governmental functions lurks a new danger to civil liberty.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my Brother BRANDEIS in this case and I agree in substance with his view. At first it seemed to me that if a publisher should announce in terms that he proposed to print treason and should demand a second-class rate it must be that the Postmaster General would have authority \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 437]\n\u00a0\n to refuse it. But reflection has convinced me that I was wrong. The question of the rate has nothing to do with the question whether the matter is mailable, and I am satisfied that the Postmaster cannot determine in advance that a certain newspaper is going to be nonmailable and on that ground deny to it not the use of the mails but the rate of postage that the statute says shall be charged.\n Of course the Postmaster may deny or revoke the second-class rate to a publication that does not comply with the conditions attached to it by statute, but as my Brother BRANDEIS has pointed out, the conditions attached to the second-class rate by the statute cannot be made to justify the Postmaster's action except by a quibble. On the other hand the regulation of the right to use the mails by the Espionage Act (40 Stat. 217) has no peculiarities as a war measure but is similar to that in earlier cases, such as obscene documents. Papers that violate the Act are declared non-mailable and the use of the mails for the transmission of them is made criminal. But the only power given to the Postmaster is to refrain from forwarding the papers when received and to return them to the senders. Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, Title XII, 40 Stat. 217, 230 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10401a-10401d); Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75, 40 Stat. 553, 554. He could not issue a general order that a certain newspaper should not be carried because he thought it likely or certain that it would contain treasonable or obscene talk. The United States may give up the postoffice when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues and it would take very strong language to convince me that Congress ever intended to give such a practically despotic power to any one man. There is no pretence that it has done so. Therefore I do not consider the limits of its constitutional power.\n To refuse the second-class rate to a newspaper is to make its circulation impossible and has all the effect of \n\n[255 U.S. 407, 438]\n\u00a0\n the order that I have supposed. I repeat. When I observe that the only powers expressly given to the Postmaster General to prevent the carriage of unlawful matter of the present kind are to stop and to return papers already existing and posted, when I notice that the conditions expressly attached to the second-class rate look only to wholly different matters, and when I consider the ease with which the power claimed by the Postmaster could be used to interfere with very sacred rights, I am of opinion that the refusal to allow the relator the rate to which it was entitled whenever its newspaper was carried, on the ground that the paper ought not to be carried at all, was unjustified by statute and was a serious attack upon liberties that not even the war induced Congress to infringe. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 3, 1885, c. 342,  1, 23 Stat. 387; Act March 3, 1879, c. 180,  17, 20 Stat. 359, 360 (Comp.

It was objected: The 'bill would invest one man ... with the power to destroy the business of a publisher without affording any opportunity for trial by jury, according to regular court practice. The punishment which may be inflicted upon a publisher by the Postmaster General under the provisions of this bill is most severe, absolutely depriving him of the privilege of using the United States mails, even for legitimate purposes. ... Furthermore, this bill makes it possible for the Postmaster General to inflict what is practically a confiscatory penalty for an offense not clearly defined. ... Under such circumstances as these it is not safe to leave to the decision of one man, after an ex parte investigation, a decision which will involve the freedom of the press. Trial by jury and a penalty inflicted for each specified act is the only safeguard against an arbitrary and tyrannical power.' The bill failed of passage.

Rec. pp. 6851-6857, submitted at the argument, the Postmaster General said:\n'For many (?) years this department has held publications not to be 'regularly issued' in contemplation of law when any issue contained nonmailable matter; and when the second-class privilege has been withdrawn under such circumstances, the formal notice of withdrawal has contained the statement that the second-class privilege has been revoked on both the grounds stated.'\n\n In his report for the year ending June 30, 1918, the Postmaster General says (page 46):\n'In the administration of the law governing second-class matter it was again found necessary to revoke the second-class mail privilege of some publications for the reason that their contents consisted more or less of matter which was nonmailable under the Espionage and other laws, and which, therefore, removed them from the class of publications entitled to that privilege.'\n\n The statement is repeated in the Postmaster General's Report for the Year Ending June 30, 1919, p. 25. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The orders of the Postmaster General excluding periodicals from second-class mail, sustained in Houghton v.

Ct. 33, his fraud order was set aside because wholly unwarranted by the facts. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Under recent legislation a 'permit' may be issued for either first, third or fourth class mail. Under Act April 28, 1904, c. 1759,  2, as amended by Act May 18, 1916, c. 126,  13 (Comp.

By Act Oct. 6, 1917, c. 106,  19, 40 Stat. 425, Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2j (the Trading with the Enemy Act), it was provided that, until the end of the war, foreign language papers should be nonmailable unless a translation should have been previously filed with the local postmaster, but that the Postmaster General might at his discretion grant a permit to mail without such translation. This act applied to publication sent by any class of the mails. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See 'Freedom of Speech' by Zechariah Chafee, Jr., pp. 105-109, 233- 234; also page 199: 'A newspaper editor fears being put out of business by the administrative denial of the second-class mailing privilege much more than the prospect of prison subject to a jury trial.' It has been uniformly held that a statute prescribing similar penalties for failure to observe its provisions or the order of a public service commission, although made after full hearing, are a deterrent so potent as to amount to a denial of the right to a judicial review, and operate as a taking of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Ct. 876): 'We do not wish even by the remotest implication to be regarded as assenting to the broad contentions concerning the existence of arbitrary power through the classification of the mails, or by way of conditions embodied in the proposition of the government which we have previously stated.' \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] This is true, although the deficit is covered directly, in large part, by profits on first-class mail. The net cost of this service to the government was, before the World War, equal to one-tenth of its expenditures for all other than postal purposes. Compare Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, \n229 \nU.S. 288, 304\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 867, with 34 Statistical Abstract of the United States (1911) p. 656. The justification for this noncompensatory service lies in the belief that education in its broad sense-intellectual activity fostered through the dissemination of information and of ideas-is essential to the life of a free, self-governing and striving people. This noncompensatory service is comparable to many rendered by the government; e. g., to the facilitation of communication and commerce by port, canal, passport or consular services, for all of which only small charges, or none, are made.\n That a government furnishing public service must be judged by ordinary standards of public callings, see Chafee on Freedom of Speech, p. 109, citing H.

C., for the United states. \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Halbert H. McCluer, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by the United States to recover the possession of a tract of land in Oklahoma, with damages for its detention and use by the defendants for several years. The trial resulted in a judgment for the defendants, which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 261 Fed. 657.\n The land was allotted and patented under the Act of March 2, 1889, c. 422, 25 Stat. 1013, to Pe-te-lon-o-zah, or William Wea, a member of the Confederated Wea, Peoria, Kaskaskia, and Piankeshaw Tribes of Indians, as his distributive share of the tribal lands. The patent was dated April 8, 1890, conveyed a fee-simple title and imposed a restriction upon alienation for a period of 25 years from its date. Wea died intestate and seized of the land January 23, 1894. Shortly after his death persons claiming to be his heirs executed a conveyance of the land, and on May 4, 1914, this court affirmed a decree against two of the present defendants, canceling that conveyance as made in violation of the restriction. Bowling v. United States, \n233 U.S. 528\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 659\n\n\n This action was commenced January 20, 1915, during the period of restriction, and, according to the petition, was brought in the interest of designated Indians who were alleged to be the heirs at law of Wea, to be entitled to the possession, and to be members of the confederated tribes and still under the supervision and guardianship of the United States. The defendants, by their answer, admitted that the land had been allotted and patented to Wea and that they were in possession; denied all the other allegations in the petition, including the heirship \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n of those in whose interest the action was brought; and alleged that at the time of answering the defendants were rightfully in possession under conveyances executed by the real heirs after the restriction upon alienation expired.\n At the trial the United States, to establish the heirship of those in whose interest the action was brought, offered in evidence an exemplified copy of a decision by the Secretary of the Interior, dated October 21, 1914, during the period of restriction, finding and holding that they were the heirs, and the sole heirs, of Wea, and stating their respective shares. To this the defendants objected upon the ground that the law of Congress under which the decision was given applied only where the deceased allottee held under a trust patent. The court sustained the objection and no other evidence on the subject was presented by either side. Whether the court erred in excluding the Secretary's determination is the only question reserved at the trial and now presented for decision. It was not claimed that the Secretary proceeded without notice or without according all who were interested a full hearing, but only that he had not been empowered to determine who were the heirs where the deceased allottee held, as did Wea, under a patent in fee, even though the land was subject to a restriction upon alienation.\n Before coming to the acts under which the Secretary of the Interior proceeded, it will be helpful to refer to the modes, long in use, by which Indians are prevented from improvidently disposing of allotted lands. One is to issue to the allottee a written instrument or certificate, called a trust patent, declaring that the United States will hold the land for a designated period, usually 25 years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or, in case of his death, of his heirs, and at the expiration of that period will convey the same to him, or \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n his heirs, in fee, discharged of the trust and free of all charge or incumbrance. The other is to issue at once to the allottee a patent conveying to him the land in fee and imposing a restriction upon its alienation for 25 years or some other stated period. While alienation is effectually restricted by either mode, allotments under the first are commonly spoken of as trust allotments and those under the second as restricted allotments. As respects both classes of allotments-one as much as the other-the United States possesses a supervisory control over the land and may take appropriate measures to make sure that it inures to the sole use and benefit of the allottee and his heirs throughout the original or any extended period of restriction. \n1\n As an incident to this power Congress may authorize and require the Secretary of the Interior to determine the legal heirs of a deceased allottee and may make that determination final and conclusive. \n2\n It rests with Congress to say which of the two modes shall be followed in respect of the lands of a particular tribe, and this usually is done in the act directing that the lands be allotted. The act of 1889, under which the lands of the confederated tribes were allotted, required that the second mode be following-that of issuing a patent in fee imposing a restriction upon alienation for a fixed period.\n By section 1 of the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, 36 Stat. 855 (Comp. St.  4226), Congress provided:\n'That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee-simple patent, without having \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.'\n\n The courts below concluded from the words of this provision that it was confined to trust allotments-those held under trust patents. Separately considered, it hardly admits of any other view; and yet other provisions in the same section suggest that its words may not have been happily chosen and that it may have been intended to be more comprehensive. To illustrate, a closely following proviso declares:\n'That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized in his discretion to issue a certificate of competency, upon application therefor, to any Indian, or in case of his death, to his heirs, to whom a patent in fee containing restrictions on alienation has been or may hereafter be issued, and such certificate shall have the effect of removing the restrictions on alienation contained in such patent.'\n\n But we need not dwell upon the internal proof of what was intended, for by a series of appropriation acts, beginning August 1, 1914, and extending to the present time, Congress has treated and construed the provision as including both trust and restricted allotments. \n3\n Each of the appropriation acts contains a paragraph appropriating $100,000 to meet the cost of 'determining the heirs of deceased Indian allottees having any right, title, or interest, in any trust or restricted allotment, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior,' and they show affirmatively that they refer to a determination under section 1 of the act of \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n 1910. Not only so, but they all contain a proviso that 'this paragraph shall not apply to the Osage Indians, nor to the Five Civilized Tribes,' which would be a needless provision, if Congress had not intended that the power to determine hirships should extend to restricted as well as trust allotments; for the allotments to the Osages and to members of the Five Civilized Tribes were not trust, but restricted, allotments. The annual reports of the Indian Bureau4 show that the officers of that bureau, including the Secretary of the Interior, have uniformly regarded section 1 of the act of 1910, in connection with these appropriation acts, as enabling them to determine the heirs of both classes of deceased allottees, and they further show that in each year since these appropriations began these officers have determined the heirs of hundreds of deceased allottees who held under restricted as distinguished from trust allotments. In one year alone the number was 566 and of course the aggregate of the values involved was great. These reports were regularly laid before Congress and, with the knowledge thus obtained, it repeated the appropriation each year. Of course, this can be accounted for only upon the theory that in the opinion of Congress the officers were but exercising the power which it intended they should have and exercise. It was after the original provision had been so construed and supplemented by the first of the appropriation acts that Wea's heirs were determined by the Secretary. Apparently the appropriation acts and the reports of the Indian Bureau were not brought to the attention of the courts below.\n We conclude that the District Court erred in sustaining \n\n[256 U.S. 484, 490]\n\u00a0\n the defendants' objection to the introduction in evidence of the Secretary's determination, and therefore that the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

R. \n\n[256 U.S. 524, 526]\n\u00a0\n Ricks feloniously conspired together that Hutto, while so employed in Indian affairs, should have an interest and concern in certain trades with the Indians not for or on account of the United States, in violation of section 2078, Rev. Stat. U. S., that is to say, that Hutto, while so employed, should have an interest and concern in sales of land by Indians of said tribe, and in the purchase of automobiles and other commodities by said Indians, and that the alleged conspirators would and should persuade, induce, procure, and cause certain Indians named, members of said Tonkawa Tribe, to sell their lands, purchase automobiles and other commodities, borrow money and lend money, and that said Hutto should have an interest and profit in said sales, purchases, and loans. The alleged overt acts need not be recited.\n Defendants having filed separate demurrers, the District Court at first sustained them upon the ground that the acts prohibited in section 2078, Rev. Stat., are not a crime against the United States, but acts for which a penalty is provided, to be collected only by a civil action, and hence cannot form the basis of a criminal conspiracy in violation of section 37, Criminal Code.\n Upon a rehearing, the demurrers again were sustained, but upon the ground that section 2078 is inapplicable to transactions involving lands or other property with respect to which the Government has no interest or control, and that no such interest or control was alleged in the indictment.\n Taking up the second point first: It seems to us the plain terms of section 2078 leave little room for discussion over the proposition that the prohibition is not confined to transactions involving lands or other property in respect to which the government has an interest or control.\n In early days, under the power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) to regulate commerce with the Indian Tribes, some traffic was carried \n\n[256 U.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n on with the Indians upon the government account. As early as the year 1796 ( chapter 13, 1 Stat. 452) the President was authorized to establish Indian trading posts on the frontiers and in the Indian country; and the agent appointed for each trading house was required to swear or affirm in his oath of office that he would not directly or indirectly be concerned or interested in any trade, commerce, or barter with any Indian or Indians but on the public account. This was a temporary measure, to continue for two years and to the end of the next session of Congress thereafter. Another act, to continue for three years, was approved April 21, 1806 ( chapter 48, 2 Stat. 402), which required of the superintendent of Indian trade an oath or affirmation faithfully to execute the trust committed to him, and that he would not directly or indirectly be concerned or interested in any trade, commerce, or barter but on the public account. A like oath was required of the agent appointed for each trading house. Still a third act for establishing trading houses with Indian tribes, approved March 2, 1811 (chapter 30, 2 Stat. 652), required a similar form of oath from the superintendent of Indian trade, and from each agent and assistant agent. This act, like the others, was limited to a brief duration.\n Section 2078, Rev. Stat., was taken, with but slight change, from section 14 of an act of June 30, 1834 (chapter 162, 4 Stat. 735, 738 [Comp. St.  4026]), entitled 'An act to provide for the organization of the department of Indian affairs,' and designed not for the carrying on of trade or barter with the Indians on government account, but to carry out treaty obligations, pay annuities and distribute merchandise to the Indians as stipulated, furnish them with domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and rations as the President might think proper, provide interpreters, blacksmiths, farmers, mechanics, and teachers, as required by treaty, and generally to promote friendly relations with \n\n[256 U.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n the Indians and advance their welfare. In this connection the provision of section 14, 'that no person employed in the Indian department shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians, except for, and on account of, the United States,' manifestly had a significance extending quite beyond any pecuniary interest of the United States in government trade or barter with the Indians. In its original setting, and more emphatically when grouped in the Revised Statutes with other provisions having to do with the supervision and management of the affairs of the Indians, it manifestly was and is designed to insure integrity of conduct on the part of all persons employed in Indian affairs, and an impartial attitude towards the Indians, by excluding from persons so employed all motives of personal gain, so that the duty of the United States as trustee for these dependent peoples, recognized wards of the government, might be performed with a single regard for their interests appropriate to the fiduciary relation. The purpose was to protect the Indians from their own improvidence; relieve them from temptations due to possible cupidity on the part of persons coming into contact with them as representatives of the United States; and thus to maintain the honor and credit of the United States, rather than to subserve its pecuniary interest.\n The District Court erred in its construction of section 2078.\n Nor can we sustain the other ground upon which it is contended the demurrers were well taken. Section 37, Criminal Code, is violated by a conspiracy 'to commit any offense against the United States,' accompanied or followed by an overt act done to effect the object of the conspiracy. It does not in terms require that the contemplated offense shall of itself be a criminal offense; nor does the nature of the subject-matter require this construction. A combination of two or more persons by concerted action to accomplish a purpose either criminal \n\n[256 U.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n or otherwise unlawful comes within the accepted definition of conspiracy. Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 542. The distinction between a conspiracy and the contemplated offense that forms its object has often been pointed out. United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 85\n, 86 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 682, and cases cited. And we deem it clear that a conspiracy to commit any offense which by act of Congress is prohibited in the interest of the public policy of the United States, although not of itself made punishable by criminal prosecution, but only by suit for penalty, is a conspiracy to commit an 'offense against the United States' within the meaning of section 37, Criminal Code, and, provided there be the necessary overt act or acts, is punishable under the terms of that section.\n We have assumed, for the sake of the argument, that under section 2078, Rev. Stat., the United States is confined to the suit for penalty specifically mentioned; but we do not so decide, and in our view the present case does not require an expression of opinion upon on that subject. See United States v. Stevenson, \n215 U.S. 190\n, 197, et seq., 30 Sup. Ct. 35.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

PFITSCH(1921)\nNo. 246\nArgued: March 22, 1921Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[256 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pursuant to section 10 of the Lever Act (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii]) the President requisitioned for the army on April 18, 1918, a radial drill belonging to Pfitsch. The Board of Appraisers of the War Department found its then value to be $3,979.50, and awarded him that amount as compensation. Pfitsch declared this amount was unsatisfactory, and insisted that the value was greater, and that he was entitled also to interest from the date of the taking. On February 5, 1919, the government paid him an amount equal to 75 per centum of the award. \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon this suit was brought by him in the District Court of the United States for Southern New York to recover the balance alleged to be due. The case was tried, by agreement, without a jury. The court found the value to be $4,550, and entered judgment for the part then unpaid, together with interest from the date of taking, at the rate of 6 per cent. on the amounts from time to time unpaid. The government brought the case here by direct writ of error and assigned as the only error that interest should not have been allowed.\n The preliminary question arises whether this court has jurisdiction on direct writ of error. The answer to be given to it depends upon the nature of the jurisdiction conferred upon the District Court by section 10 of the Lever Act. If the jurisdiction is to be exercised in the manner provided by section 24, paragraph 20, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), which confers upon the District Court jurisdiction concurrent with the court of Claims a direct writ of error lies from this court. J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. U. S., \n248 U.S. 458\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 158. If however, the jurisdiction is the ordinary jurisdiction of the District Court, the writ of error should have gone, in the first instance, from the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1120). The nature of the jurisdiction of the District Court is of importance, not only because of the question directly involved, but because the answer given to it will determine incidentally whether plaintiffs who proceed under section 10 are entitled to a trial by jury; for section 24, paragraph 20, of the Judicial Code declares that 'all suits brought and tried under the provisions of this paragraph shall be tried by the court without a jury.' See United States v. McGrane (C. C. A.) 270 Fed. 761; Filbin Corporation v. United States (D. C.) 266 Fed. 911.\n Section 10 provides that the President may requisition foods, feeds, fuels, and other war supplies with the necessary storage facilities, and that he shall ascertain and pay \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n just compensation for them. But if any person is not satisfied with the President's award he is to receive 75 per cent. of the award and for the balance claimed 'shall be entitled to sue the United States ... and jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the United States District Courts to hear and determine all such controversies.' Three later sections of the act which provide for requisitioning other classes of property-section 12 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 jj), relating to factories, mines, and pipe lines; section 16 (section 3115 1\/8 ll), to distilled spirits; and section 25 (section 3115 1\/8 q), to coal or coke plants or businesses-make provision for suits against the United States to recover just compensation in terms materially different from that in section 10. Each of those three sections provides in identical terms that a person dissatisfied with the President's award 'shall be entitled to sue the United States ... in the manner provided by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and section one hundred and forty-five of the Judicial Code.' The latter of these sections of the Judicial Code confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to adjudicate claims against the United States, and the former confers upon the District Courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims in cases which do not involve more than $10,000. Thus, while section 12, 16 and 25 of the Lever Act, in terms, confers jurisdiction concurrently upon the Court of Claims and the District Courts sitting as a Court of Claims, section 10, in terms, confers jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under it upon the District Courts alone. The question presented to us is whether this exclusive jurisdiction granted the District Courts by section 10 is to be exercised in accordance with the law governing the usual procedure of a District Court in actions at law for money compensation or by the provisions of the law governing the exceptional jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims where it sits without a jury.\n The legislative history of the Lever Act establishes that \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n the difference of the jurisdictional provision in section 10 from those of sections 12, 16, and 25 was the result, not of inadvertence, but of deliberate action in the face of opposition. The jurisdictional provision of section 10, as introduced into the House of Representatives and as originally passed by it, was in the precise form in which it was enacted into law. 65th Cong. 1st Sess. House Rept. 75; 55 Cong. Rec. 4113. When the bill reached the Senate from the House, the Senate committee reported an amendment striking out the House provision and substituting a provision which made section 10 in this respect identical with sections 12, 16, and 25; that is, the senate committee's amendment provided that suits under section 10 should be brought against the United States 'in the manner provided by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and section one hundred and forty-five of the Judicial Code.' 55 Cong. Rec. 4626. This would have conferred concurrent jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims and the District Court sitting as a Court of Claims. As so amended, section 10 was passed by the Senate; but the House refused to concur in this amendment. And this disagreement, with eight others relating to section 10, was sent to the conference committee. 55 Cong. Rec. 5473. The House conferees recommended receding from objections to the eight other Senate amendments of this section, but they insisted upon the objection to the change of the jurisdictional provision. 55 Cong. Rec. 5733-5737. The Senate conferees recommended receding from its amendment to the jurisdictional provision and that the original House provision be restored. 55 Cong. Rec. 5709. In reporting for the House conferees, Mr. Lever said of this amendment:\n'Amendment 30. This amendment gives jurisdiction, in suits to recover just compensation under section 10 of the House Bill, to the Court of Claims in addition to the United States District Courts. The Senate recedes.' 65th Congress, 1st Sess. House Report No. 117, p. 14; 55 Cong. Rec. 5737. \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n It is plain, then, that Congress had this question presented to its attention in a most precise form. It had the issue clearly drawn between granting for the adjudication of cases arising under this section concurrent jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and the District Courts without a trial by jury, or of establishing an exclusive jurisdiction in the District Courts of which the right to a jury trial is an incident. The first alternative was rejected, and the reason given for this rejection in the statement of the House conferees is that the proposed amendment would confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims. It is difficult to conceive of any rational ground for rejecting the clear and explicit amendment made by the Senate, except to accord a trial by jury. All difficulties of construction vanish if we are willing to give to the words of section 10, deliberately adopted, their natural meaning.\n\n Furthermore, it is significant that this is not the only occasion upon which Congress has provided for suits against the United States exclusively in the District Courts. Section 1 of the War Risk Insurance Act of May 20, 1918, c. 77, 40 Stat. 555, provides that suits upon insurance policies 'may be brought against the United States in the District Court of the United States in and for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of them resides.' The Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125,  3, 40 Stat. 1348 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 kk \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 3]\n\u00a0\n), which authorizes the President to requisition storage facilities for wheat, provides, in the words of section 10 of the Lever Act, that 'jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the United States District Courts to hear and determine all such controversies.' And section 2 of the Act of July 11, 1918, c. 145, 40 Stat. 898 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp, 1919,  514e), permits suits against the United States on marine insurance 'in the District Court of the United States, sitting in admiralty.'\n A survey of the war legislation permitting the seizure of property discloses that congress has established three distinct jurisdictions for the purpose of suit against the \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n United States for compensation. In 17 instances1 it definitely provided by reference to the appropriate sections of the Judicial Code for concurrent jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and the District Courts sitting as a court of claims. In the four instances above set forth it conferred jurisdiction only on the District Courts. In four instances it conferred jurisdiction only on the Court of Claims. \n2\n The established rule of statutory construction should lead us to give effect in every practicable manner to the distinctions which Congress has seen fit to make. Compare Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523, 533\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 397. And where it designates a \n\n[256 U.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction in which the trial will be with a jury instead of one where the trial will be by the court alone, it is our duty to give effect to its designation.\n The writ of error is dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Statutes which provide for suits for compensation against the United States in both the District Courts and the Court of Claims in the manner provided by section 24, par. 20, and section 145 of the Judicial Code (Comp.

St.  1704). The indictment is in four counts. \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 458]\n\u00a0\n The first count, based on section 3257 of the U. S. Rev. Stats. (Comp. Stats.  5993), charges the defendants with unlawfully engaging in the business of distillers within the intent and meaning of the internal revenue laws of the United States, and that in fact they did distill spirits subject to the internal revenue tax imposed by the laws of the United States, and did defraud and attempt to defraud the United States of the tax on said spirits. The second count, based on section 3279 of the U. S. Rev. Stats. (Comp. Stat.  6019), charges that the defendants failed to keep on the distillery, conducted by them, any sign exhibiting the name or firm of the distiller, with the words 'Registered Distillery,' as required by statute. The third court, based on section 3281 of the U. S. Rev. Stats.( Comp. Stats.  6021), charges the defendants with carrying on the business of distilling within the intent and meaning of the revenue laws of the United States without giving the bond required by law. The fourth count, based on section 3282 of the U. S. Rev. Stats. (section 6022, Comp. Stats .), charges the defendants with unlawfully making a mash, fit for distillation, in a building not a distillery duly authorized by law.\n The defendants interposed a motion to quash the indictment upon the grounds that the acts of Congress under which the same was found were repealed before the finding of the indictment, and that the acts charged to have been committed by them were after the date upon which the Eighteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution and the Volstead Act (41 Stat. 305) became effective. Defendants also filed a demurrer to the indictment on practically the same grounds. The motion to quash and the demurrer were sustained by the District Court. 266 Fed. 746.\n The sections of the Revised Statutes may be summarized as follows: Section 3257 makes it an offense to defraud or attempt to defraud the United States of a tax \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 459]\n\u00a0\n upon spirits distilled by one carrying on the business of a distillery, provides for forfeiting the distillery and the distilling-apparatus and all spirits found in the distillery or on the distillery premises, and subjects the offender to a fine of not less than $500 or more than $5,000, and imprisonment of not less than six months or more than three years. Section 3279 requires distillers to exhibit on the outside of their place of business a sign with the words 'Registered Distillery.' A violation of this section subjects the offender to a fine of $500. Section 3281 makes it an offense to carry on the business of a distiller without having given bond. For such offense the penalty is a fine from $1,000 to $5,000 and imprisonment not less than six months or more than three years. Section 3282 makes it penal to make or permit mash to be made in any building other than a distillery authorized by law. A violation of this section subjects the offender to a fine of not less than $500 or more than $5,000, and imprisonment of not less than six months or more than two years.\n These statutes have long been part of the federal internal revenue legislation, and were passed under the authority of the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution of the United States. At the time of their enactment it was legal, so far as the federal government was concerned, to manufacture and sell ardent spirits for beverage purposes. The government derived large revenue from taxing the business, which it sought to realize and protect by the system of laws of which the sections in question were a part. This policy was radically changed by the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, and the enactment of legislation to make the amendment effective. The Eighteenth Amendment in comprehensive and clear language prohibits the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors in the United States for \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 460]\n\u00a0\n beverage purposes, and confers upon Congress the power to enforce the amendment by appropriate legislation. To this end, Congress passed a national prohibition law known as the Volstead Act. 41 Stat. 305. It is a comprehensive statute intended to prevent the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.\n Before taking up the sections of the Revised Statutes, some provisions of the Volstead Act may be appropriately referred to. Section 3 provides that after the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States goes into effect it shall be illegal to manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in the act. Liquor for nonbeverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold, bartered, transported, imported, exported, delivered, furnished and possessed but only as in the act provided, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may issue permits therefor. The act contains many provisions to make effective the purposes declared in section 3. Section 25, tit. 2, makes it unlawful to have or possess any liquor or property designed for the manufacture of liquor intended for use in violation of the act or which has been so used, and provides that no property rights shall exist in any such liquor or property. The same section provides for the issue of search warrants, and if it is found that any liquor or property be unlawfully held or possessed, or had been unlawfully used, the liquor and all property designed for the unlawful manufacture of liquor shall be destroyed, unless the court otherwise orders. Section 29 provides that any person who manufactures or sells liquor in violation of title 2 of the act shall for a first offense be fined not less than $1,000, or be imprisoned not exceeding six months, and for a second or subsequent offense shall be fined \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 461]\n\u00a0\n not less than $200 or more than $2,000 and be imprisoned for not less than one month nor more than five years.\n In title 3 elaborate provision is made for the production of alcohol in industrial alcohol plants. It provides for the taxation of such alcohol, and excepts industrial alcohol plants and bonded warehouses for the storage and distribution of industrial alcohol from certain sections of the Revised Statutes.\n It is well settled that in cases of this character the construction or sufficiency of the indictment is not brought before us.

As that court evidently construed the statutes upon the assumption that the charges had relation to intoxicating liquors intended for beverage purposes, we shall follow that view of the indictment in determining whether the former statutes are still in force.\n Section 35 (in the margin)1 in its first sentence repeals \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 462]\n\u00a0\n all prior acts to the extent of their inconsistency with the National Prohibition Act, to that extent and no more, and provides that no revenue stamps, or tax receipts, shall be issued in advance for the illegal manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors, and that upon evidence of such illegal manufacture or sale the tax shall be assessed in double the amount now provided by law, with an additional penalty of $500 as to retail dealers and $1,000 as to manufacturers, and that the payment of such tax or penalty shall not give the right to engage in the manufacture or sale of such liquors, or relieve any one from criminal liability.\n That Congress may under the broad authority of the taxing power tax intoxicating liquors notwithstanding their production is prohibited and punished we have no question. The fact that the statute in this aspect had a moral end in view as well as the raising of revenue, presents no valid constitutional objection to its enactment. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471; In re Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526, 536\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 444; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 U.S. 394\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854; United States v. Doremus, \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 283. The question remains concerning the applicability of section 3257, involving the right to punish for attempting to defraud the United States of a tax, did Congress intend to punish such violation of law by imposing the old penalty denounced \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 463]\n\u00a0\n in section 3257 or as provided in the new and special provision enacted in the Volstead Act?\n It is contention of the government that section 35 saves the right to prosecute as to taxes, as well as the acts charged as violative of the other sections of the Revised Statutes, because of the phrase with which the section concludes:\n'... Nor shall this act relieve any person from any liability, civil or criminal, heretofore or hereafter incurred under existing laws.'\n\n It is, of course, settled that repeals by implication are not favored. It is equally well settle that a later statute repeals former ones when clearly inconsistent with the earlier enactments. United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88. In construing penal statutes, it is the rule that later enactments repeal former ones practically covering the same acts, but fixing a lesser penalty. The concluding phrase of section 35 by itself considered is strongly indicative of an intention to retain the old laws. But this section must be interpreted in view of the constitutional provision contained in the Eighteenth Amendment and in view of the provisions of the Volstead Act intended to make that amendment effective.\n Having in mind these principles and considering now the first count of the indictment charging an attempt to defraud and actually defrauding the government of the revenue tax, we do not believe that the general language used at the close of section 35 evidences the intention of Congress to inflict for such an offense the unishment provided in section 3257 with the resulting forfeiture, fine, and imprisonment, and at the same time to authorize prosecution and punishment under section 35 enacting lesser and special penalties for failing to pay such taxes by imposing a tax in double the amount provided by law, with an additional penalty of $500 on retailers and $1,000 on manufacturers. Moreover, the concluding words of the first paragraph of section 35, as to all the offenses charged, must \n\n[256 U.S. 450, 464]\n\u00a0\n be read in the light of established legal principles governing the interpretation of statutes, and in view of the provisions of the Volstead Act itself making it unlawful to possess intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, or property designed for the manufacture of such liquor, and providing for its destruction. We agree with the court below that while Congress manifested an intention to tax liquors illegally as well as those legally produced, which was within its constitutional power, it did not intend to preserve the old penalties prescribed in section 3257 in addition to the specific provision for punishment made in the Volstead Act.\n We have less difficulty with the other sections of the prior revenue legislation under which the charges, already set forth, are made. We think it was not intended to keep on foot the requirement as to displaying the words 'Registered Distillery' in a place intended for the production of liquor for beverage purposes which could no longer be lawfully conducted; nor to require a bond for the control of such production; nor to penalize the making of mash in a distillery which could not be authorized by law.\n The questions before us solely concern the construction of the statutes involved, under an indictment pertaining to the production of liquor for beverage purposes, and we think they were correctly answered in the opinion. of the court below. It follows that its judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 35: 'All provisions of law that are inconsistent with this act are repealed only to the extent of such inconsistency and the regulations herein provided for the manufacture or traffic in intoxicating liquor shall be construed as in addition to existing laws. This act shall not relieve anyone from paying taxes or other charges imposed upon the manufacture or traffic in such liquor. No liquor revenue stamps or tax receipts for any illegal manufacture or sale shall be issued in advance, but upon evidence of such illegal manufacture or sale a tax shall be assessed against, and collected from, the person responsible for such illegal manufacture or sale in double the amount now provided by law, with an additional penalty of $500 on retail dealers and $1,000 on manufacturers. The payment of such tax or penalty shall give no right to engage in the manufacture or sale of such liquor, or relieve anyone from criminal liability, nor shall this act relieve any person from any liability, civil or criminal, heretofore or hereafter incurred under existing laws.

BURKE(1921)\nNo. 183\nArgued: January 27, 1921Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Oscar R. Houston, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Arthur W. Clement and Wilson E. Tipple, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 10, 1915, S. Ontra & Bro. delivered to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company at Yokohama, Japan, 56 cases of 'drawn work goods and renaissance,' consigned to their own order at New York, and received a bill of lading for ocean transportation to San Francisco and thence by the Southern Pacific Company and its connections, by rail, to destination. The property was delivered to the Southern Pacific Company and without new billing was carried to a junction with the line of the petitioner, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and while in its custody was totally destroyed in a collision. The respondent, successor in interest to the consignor, claimed in this suit the right to recover the fair invoice value of the goods, $17,449.01, and the petitioner conceded his right to recover, but only to the amount of the agreed valuation of $100 per package, $5,600, to which it contended he was limited by the bill of lading. All of the facts are stipulated or proved by undisputed evidence.\n The Appellate Division First Department, New York Supreme Court, rendered judgment in favor of respondent for $5,600, with interest and costs, but on appeal to the Court of Appeals of that state the judgment of the Appellate Division was reversed, and an order was entered that \n\n[255 U.S. 317, 319]\n\u00a0\n a judgment should be rendered by the Supreme Court in favor of respondent for $17,449.01, with interest and costs. The case is brought here on certiorari.\n On the face of the bill of lading received at Yokohama was the notation:\n'Weight 26,404 lbs.; ocean weight rate, 50c; freight $132.02. Rail, minimum carload weight 30,000 lbs., wght rate $1.25. Freight $375.00.' (Thus the ocean and rail rates are separately stated, and the latter is $1.25 per 100 pounds minimum carload.)\n\n On the back of the bill of lading were printed 31 conditions, the thirteenth of which contained the provision that--\n'It is expressly agreed that the goods named in this bill of lading are hereby valued at not exceeding $100 per package, ... and the liability of the companies therefor in case of the total loss of all or any of the said goods from any cause shall not exceed $100 per package.'\n\n The petitioner was an interstate common carrier by rail at the time of the shipment involved, and as such had filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission schedules of rates and regulations under which the property was moving at the time it was destroyed. By these schedules the carrier was bound, and to them it was limited, in contracting for traffic. Southern Railway v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632, 638\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 469. The statute expressly provided that it should not charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for the transportation of property or for any service in connection therewith than such as was specified in such schedules. 34 Stat. 587,  6 ( Comp. St.  8569, 8597).\n In these schedules was included a rule, designated as rule 9A, which reads:\n'Unless otherwise provided, when property is transported subject to the provisions of the Western Classification, the acceptance and use are required, respectively, of the 'uniform bill of lading,' 'straight' or 'order' as shown on pages 87 to 90, inclusive.'\n\n For the purposes of this case, only, it is admitted, and \n\n[255 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n accepted by this court, that this rule 9A permitted and required that the property should be treated as moving east of San Francisco under the uniform bill of lading, although, in fact, no other than the Yokohama bill of lading was issued. This uniform bill of lading contained, among other conditions, the following:\n'The amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the property (being the bona fide invoice price, if any, to the consignee, including the freight charges, if prepaid) at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, unless a lower value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has been agreed upon or is determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower value shall be the maximum amount to govern such computation whether or not such loss or damage occurs from negligence.'\n\n Upon the facts thus stated the petitioner contends that the agreed valuation of $100 per package or case in the Yokohama bill of lading is necessarily imported into the uniform bill of lading, becomes the valuation 'agreed upon' within the terms and conditions quoted from that bill, and limits the respondent's recovery to that amount, $5,600, regardless of the value of the property and of the fact that it was lost by the carrier's negligence.\n To this contention it is replied by the respondent: That it is admitted by the petitioner that its filed and published schedules contained but one rate applicable to the shipment as it was carried east of San Francisco; that that rate, $1.25 per 100 pounds minimum carload, was charged in the Yokohama bill of lading; and that, since no choice of rates was given, or could be given, to the shipper, any agreement, in form a valuation of the property, made for the purpose of limiting the carrier's liability to less than the real value thereof, in case of loss by negligence, was void and without effect. \n\n[255 U.S. 317, 321]\n\u00a0\n In many cases, from the decision in Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., \n112 U.S. 331\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 151, decided in 1884, to Boston & Maine Railroad v. Piper, \n246 U.S. 439\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 354, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 469, decided in 1918, it has been declared to be the settled federal law that, if a common carrier gives to a shipper the choice of two rates, the lower of them conditioned upon his agreeing to a stipulated valuation of his property in case of loss, even by the carrier's negligence, if the shipper makes such a choice understandingly and freely, and names his valuation, he cannot thereafter recover more than the value which he thus places upon his property.\n As a matter of legal distinction, estoppel is made the basis of this ruling-that, having accepted the benefit of the lower rate, in common honesty the shipper may not repudiate the conditions on which it was obtained-but the rule and the effect of it are clearly established.\n The petitioner admits all this, but contends that it has never been held by this court that such choice of rates was essential to the validity of valuation agreements, and, arguing that they should be sustained unless shown to have been fraudulently or oppressively obtained, it affirms the validity of the agreement in the Yokohama bill of lading, and cites as a decisive authority Reid v. American Express Co., \n241 U.S. 544\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 712\n\n\n With this contention we cannot agree.\n This court has consistently held the law to be that it is against public policy to permit a common carrier to limit its common-law liability by contracting for exemption from the consequences of its own negligence or that of its servants (\n112 \nU.S. 331, 338\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 151, and \n246 \nU.S. 439, 444\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 354, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 469, supra), and valuation agreements have been sustained only on principles of estoppel and in carefully restricted cases where choice of rates was given-where 'the rate was tied to the release.' Thus in the Hart Case, \n112 U.S. 343\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 157, it is said:\n'The distinct ground of our decision in the case at bar is that, where a contract of the kind, signed by the shipper, is \n\n[255 U.S. 317, 322]\n\u00a0\n fairly made, agreeing on the valuation of the property carried, with the rate of freight based on the condition that the carrier assumes liability only to the extent of the agreed valuation, even in case of loss or damage by the negligence of the carrier, the contract will be upheld as a proper and lawful mode of securing a due proportion between the amount for which the carrier may be responsible and the freight he receives, and of protecting himself against extravagant and fanciful valuations.'\n\n And in the Piper Case it is said (\n246 U.S. 444\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 355, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 469):\n'In the previous decisions of this court upon that subject it has been said that the limited valuation for which a recovery may be had does not permit the carrier to defeat recovery because of losses arising from its own negligence, but serves to fix the amount of recovery upon an agreed valuation made in consideration of the lower rate stipulated to be paid for the service.'\n\n The Reid Case, supra, does not conflict with these decisions, for in that case the bill of lading containing the undervaluation, which was there sustained, expressly recited that the freight was adjusted on the basis of the agreed value, and that the carrier's liability should not exceed that sum 'unless a value in excess thereof be specially declared, and stated herein, and extra freight as may be agreed on be paid.' The bill of lading was for ocean carriage only, London to New York, to which, of course, the Interstate Commerce Act was not applicable (36 Stat. 544,  1 [Comp. St.  8563]; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 78\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 428; Cosmopolitan Shipping Co. v. Hamburg- American Packet Co. et al., 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 266) and the carrier, therefore, was in a position to tender to, and, by the quoted provision of the bill, did tender to, the shipper the choice of paying a higher rate and being subject to less restricted recovery in case of loss. The case was plainly within the scope of the prior decisions of this court upon the subject.\n Thus this valuation rule, where choice is given to and accepted \n\n[255 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n by a shipper, is, in effect, an exception to the common-law rule of liability of common carriers, and the latter rule remains in full effect as to all cases not falling within the scope of such exception. Having but one applicable published rate east of San Francisco, the petitioner did not give, and could not lawfully have given, the shipper a choice of rates, and therefore the stipulation of value in the Yokohama bill of lading, even if treated as imported into the uniform bill of lading, cannot bring the case within the valuation exception, and the carrier's liability must be determined by the rules of the common law. To allow the contention of the petitioner would permit carriers to contract for partial exemption from the results of their own negligence without giving to shippers any compensating privilege. Obviously such agreements could be made only with the ignorant, the unwary, or with persons deliberately deceived. It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of New York, entered upon the order of the Court of Appeals of that state, must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED FUEL GAS CO. v.

Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 265\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 101 just decided. Acts of Extraordinary Session, 1919, c. 5. The statute taxes the transportation of natural gas as well as of oil by pipe lines and the plaintiff Gas Company makes the same objection that was made by the Oil Company in the former case to the constitutionality of the act as well as others that it will not be necessary to discuss. The two cases were heard together and were disposed of in a single opinion by the Supreme Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court of the State held the statute void, but he Supreme Court, as before, upheld it as valid with regard to intrastate business 'as above defined' and defined the plaintiff's business as intrastate. The plaintiff drew in question the validity of the statute 'as construed and applied' (Merchants National Bank of Richmond v. Richmond, \n256 U.S. 635\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 619, June 6, 1921), and took this writ of error. It also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. For the reasons given in the Eureka Case the writ of error will be entertained and the petition for certiorari dismissed.\n The case was heard upon the pleadings and a stipulation as to facts. It appears that the plaintiff gathers and purchases natural gas, mostly in West Virginia, and distributes it through its pipes which extend to or beyond the State line in various places and also connect with the pipes of other companies that extend beyond the State. The total amount dealt with by the plaintiff in the year ending July 1, 1919, was 54,973,588 M cubic feet of which all but a little over a million M. cubic feet was gathered in West Virginia. There were sold directly to consumers in West Virginia 11,590,656 M. cubic feet; a little over 10,000,000 M cubic feet to consumers in other States; and the remainder was sold to four connecting companies. It is admitted that the gas sold to one of these, the Ohio Fuel Supply Company, is transported in Interstate Commerce, so that that may be laid on one side. Another of them is the Columbia Gas & Electric Company. Ninetynine \n\n[257 U.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of the gas received by it is carried out of the State and sold, yearly. A third is the Pittsburgh-West Virginia Gas Company, which yearly disposes of eighty-eight per cent. of the gas in the same way. The fourth is the Hope Natural Gas Company, which in like manner carries sixty-seven per cent. of the gas bought from the plaintiff out of the State and sells it there.\n In short the great body of the gas starts for points outside the State and goes to them. That the necessities of business require a much smaller amount destined to points within the State to be carried undistinguished in the same pipes does not affect the character of the major transportation. Neither is the case as to the gas sold to the three companies changed by the fact that the plaintiff, as owner of the gas, and the purchasers after they receive it might change their minds before the gas leaves the State and that the precise proportions between local and outside deliveries may not have been fixed, although they seem to have been. The typical and actual course of events marks the carriage of the greater part as commerce among the States and theoretical possibilities may be left out of account. There is no break, no period of deliberation, but a steady flow ending as contemplated from the beginning beyond the State line. Ohio R. R. Commission v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 108\n, 32 S.

Hornbrook, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendants in error, alleging themselves to be engaged either as wholesale or retail grocers in Indianapolis, Indiana, brought this suit against plaintiff in error, herein \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n called the Railroad Company, to restrain it from charging or receiving any other compensation than that mentioned and described in an order entered by the Railroad Commission of the state on December 14, 1906, and which, it is alleged, became effective February 14, 1907, and to require the Railroad Company to receive and transport freight at the rates prescribed in the order of the commission.\n The first pleading of the Railroad Company was a demurrer to the complaint. We omit it as it was overruled and as the case depends upon the answer of the Railroad Company and a demurrer to it. It was in three paragraphs. In the first it denied 'each and every material allegation' of the complaint. In the second it alleged that the order of the Commission would not yield 'revenue sufficient to reimburse the Railroad Company for handling and carrying the classes of property specified in the order, and provide a fair return on the property used in the service.' And that, therefore, if the order of the Commission should be enforced, the Railroad Company would be deprived of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the third paragraph it alleged that within 60 days after the act of the state took effect it filed with the Commission a schedule of its rates and charges between all of the points in the state, that it had kept on file a like schedule in every station and depot and in its offices, that its charges had been in accordance with such schedules and were legal rates for the service, and that complainants (defendants in error) had not been and were not damaged thereby. Dismissal of the suit was prayed.\n There was a demurrer to the second paragraph for insufficiency to constitute a defense, and, following the local practice, there was a memorandum specifying the grounds, as follows: (1) There was no statement that the \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n order of the Commission was unremunerative or confiscatory at the time it was made, or at the time suit was brought, but only at the time the answer was filed. Nor did it aver that at either of those times the rates would not pay the cost of the service to which they were applicable and leave the company a fair return upon the property used in the service. (2) Nor aver that when taken in connection with the other rates lawfully prescribed by the Commission and its successor, the Public Service Commission, the rates did not afford an adequate and remunerative compensation for the handling and transportation of all classes of freight or passengers covered by such orders. (3) The averment that the rates were not compensatory 'states no issue of fact, but the mere conclusion of the pleader as to a material fact.' (4) The answer did not profess to set out the schedules of rates filed with the Commission or posted in the offices of the Railroad Company. And, further, that if the schedules of rates varied from those of the Commission, they were thus far unlawful and invalid under the laws of the state and constituted no defense to the action; 'the mere continuance in such wrongful conduct' did 'not constitute a defense.' And, further, if the rates charged were the same as those prescribed by the Commission, the fact could be proved under the general denial.\n The demurrer was sustained by the court and the Railroad Company ruled to answer by September 5, 1916. The company elected to stand by its answer and declined to plead further. The case, therefore, rested on the complaint and the denial of its allegations by the Railroad Company, and upon the issue thus made there was a trial upon which there were admitted in evidence over the objection of the Railroad Company, a transcript of the record of the suit brought by the Railroad Company against Union B. Hunt et al., constituting the Railroad Commission of the state, in the District Court of the \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n United States for the District of Indiana, and a transcript of the record in the same case in this court, entitled Wood v. Vandalia Railroad Co., \n231 U.S. 1\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 7, and, over objection, the proceedings before the Railroad Commission under which the order was made, establishing the rates that are the subject of controversy.\n The court enjoined the Railroad Company from charging, collecting or receiving from plaintiffs and others in like situation other rates than those mentioned in the order of the Commission, and enjoined the rates in excess thereof. The decree specifically mentioned the rates to be charged. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.\n It will be observed, therefore, that one of the grounds of the demurrer to the second paragraph of the answer of the Railroad Company was not that the rates were noncompensatory but that they were not alleged to be so at the time of the order of the commission or at the commencement of the suit, but were only alleged to be so at the time of filing the answer. The Supreme Court seems to intimate concurrence in this view of the answer, but said whether its ruling be based on that construction of the answer 'or upon the evidence heard' it, the court, was satisfied that the railroad had 'not tendered or made a defense, and that the decision' of the trial court was correct.\n The court put in contrast the contentions of the parties as follows:\n'Appellees [plaintiffs] assert that, for all that thus appears, appellant may receive sufficient net income on all its other business on this division, and on all of its business, including the specified classes, on other divisions, to furnish it a fair return on all its investments and operations, including the transportation of these classes, and therefore appellant will receive all to which it is entitled, though this order be enforced.' 'Appellant [Railroad Company] asserts that the state has no power \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n to thus segregate a certain class of traffic and require the railroad company to carry that traffic at unremunerative rates.'\n\n The cases that were adduced to sustain the respective contentions the court enumerated, but considered that there was 'little or no conflict' in them and that any confusion in them 'almost altogether disappears' when they 'are read in view of the fundamental principles involved.' The court's conclusion from the cases was, that--\n'A carrier is entitled to fair remuneration on all its investments and property. It is entitled to no more. For this it undertakes to reasonably serve in the capacity chosen by it. It undertakes to serve for no less. If the carrier receives, in the aggregate, such fair remuneration, notwithstanding the rates on a part of its business are not remunerative, the carrier has no basis for complaint.'\n\n And further--\n'When a rate on a part of the business is too low, some other part of the carrier's business may be paying too much, thus preventing a deficiency of income which would otherwise result from the nonremunerative rates. In such cases the shippers affected by the higher rates may have a basis for complaint. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, op. 540, et seq.'\n\n The court considered that the principle of the proposition announced was in its opinion 'strongly upheld' in Wood v. Vandalia Railroad Co., which the court regarded 'to say the least' as holding that the hearing upon the character of rates 'is not properly confined to the particular rates and the 'actual cost and outlay' in carrying the classes specified on a ... division in ascertaining whether a fair return is provided.'\n The court, therefore, makes clear the federal question, and its decision makes the question precise by a contrast of the contentions of the parties. Let us repeat them: That of the Railroad Company is that the revenue from traffic to which the rates apply is the test of their legality \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n and any deficiency in them cannot be made up by rates on some other traffic; that of the defendants in error is that the revenue from all of the intrastate business of the Railroad Company is to be taken into account, and if it be sufficient to remunerate the Railroad Company, the particular rates though unremunerative, are nevertheless legal.\n The question presented by the contentions is not easy of offhand solution, though its elements are easy of declaration. A railroad is private property, and, as such, a rate may be fixed for its use; but it is private property devoted to the public service, and as such it is subject to the power of the state to see and require that the rate fixed be just and reasonable, one that, while it will yield a revenue to the railroad, will be proportioned to that which should be charged to the public. And this relation of right and power is illustrated in many cases. It is declared in Northern Pacific Railroad v. North Dakota, \n236 U.S. 585\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1, and a test of it given, that is, when the right must yield to the power and when the power is limited by the right. And there was a consideration and review of all of the elements involved. It was declared that the Legislature 'has a wide range of ... power to prescribe reasonable charges, and it is not bound to fix uniform rates for all commodities, or to secure the same percentage of profit on every sort of business. ... It is not bound to prescribe separate rates for every individual service performed, but it may group services by fixing rates for classes of traffic.' And this court will not sit in judgment upon such action and substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature when reviewing 'a particular tariff or schedule which yields substantial compensation for the services it embraces, when the profitableness of the intrastate business as a whole is not involved.' 'But,' the court said, 'a different question arises when a state has segregated \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n a commodity, or a class of traffic, and has attempted to compel the carrier to transport it at a loss or without substantial compensation even though the entire traffic to which the rate is applied is taken into account. On that fact being satisfactorily established, the presumption of reasonableness is rebutted.' And, further, 'it has repeatedly been assumed in the decisions of this court that the state has no arbitrary power over the carrier's rates and may not select a particular commodity or class of traffic for carriage without reasonable reward.' It was hence concluded that where there is such segregation and a rate imposed which would compel the carrier to transport a commodity 'for less than the proper cost of transportation, or virtually at cost,' the carrier would be 'denied a reasonable reward for its service,' and 'the state has exceeded its authority.'\n The case and its principle were followed and illustrated in Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Conley, Attorney General of the State of West Virginia, \n236 U.S. 605\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 437, and the principle applied to a passenger rate. It was there said, explaining the 'range of permissible action' by a state that it, the state, 'has no arbitrary power over rates; ... and that the state may not select a commodity, or class of traffic, and instead of fixing what may be deemed to be reasonable compensation for its carriage, compel the carrier to transport it either at less than cost or for a compensation that is merely nominal.' See, also, Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. R. R. Comm., \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183.\n These cases leave nothing to be said, nor need we review prior cases from which they are deductions. The concession of counsel is:\n'That it may be admitted that the North Dakota and West Virginia cases have greatly discredited the previous theory and practice under which a rate which returned any revenue over and above 'out of pocket' costs was considered to be constitutionally remunerative. ... '\n\n Counsel are mistaken \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n in their judgment of those cases. They did not discredit what had been announced of either theory or practice; they only removed them from misunderstanding and controversy and declared a principle that assigned to the state a useful power of regulation while it accorded to railroads a reasonable return upon the capital invested and a reward for its enterprise; a principle, therefore, which keeps power and right in proper relation, if we may repeat ourselves, power not exercised in excess, right not used in abuse.\n It is, however, contended by the defendants in error that the averments of the answer (second paragraph) are not sufficient to present the issue of law based upon it because it does not allege that the rates are not compensatory of the cost of the service 'between the stations to which the rates apply,' and that, therefore, it may well be that they are remunerative of that service, and 'only be nonremunerative when applied to some other carriage.' And it is further urged that the answer fails to specify upon what part of the carrier's property the rates will not yield a fair return, and, it is consistent with the answer, that there may be a fair return on the value of the property 'used in carriage between the stations named in the order, although not sufficient to 'provide a fair return in handling and carrying the classes of property in said order specified' over some other part of its line.'\n The distinctions are artificial and strained. They are an attempt to make the necessary implications of the answer no part of it. The averment of a pleading need not be so certain than an affirmative allegation of the existence of a fact or condition must be accompanied by the negation of that which is contradictory to it or inconsistent with it. The answer besides is addressed to the complaint and to the rates and order of the Commission \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 122]\n\u00a0\n that constitute the bases of the complaint, and puts them and the effect of them in issue. In other words, the complaint deals with the rates and service between designated stations, and the answer deals with those rates and that service. And the Supreme Court so regarded it and explicitly said that the evidence made the issue. Counsel attack the conclusion as unsupported, but we must accept it as it is the judgment of the court we are reviewing and it is to be estimated by the reasons given for it.\n We therefore repeat, we regard the answer as a reply to the complaint and as alleging the invalidity of the order of the Commission because it required a service that the rates did not compensate, and necessarily this involves a consideration of all of the elements which are involved in that service, and determine its effect. It is to be remembered that we are dealing with a pleading. What the evidence may show we can neither know nor anticipate.\n Another contention of defendants in error is that the law of the state prescribes the remedy to be pursued against an order of the Commission to be to procure from the Secretary of the Commission a transcript of the proceedings before the Commission and file such transcript with a statement of the causes of complaint against the action of the Commission in the office of the clerk of the Appellate Court of the state within a designated time, and give notice to the Commission. And, it is said, the Appellate Court is given power to affirm the action of the Commission or to change, modify, or set it aside as justice may require, and that its judgment is made final. This procedure was not followed, it is said, and that hence the answer (paragraph 2) of the Railroad Company 'was not a compliance with this requirement of the substantive law of Indiana, and for that reason failed to state a defense.'\n The contention is made for the first time in this court. \n\n[255 U.S. 113, 123]\n\u00a0\n Its lateness may not militate against it, but that it did not occur sooner to counsel and not at all to the Supreme Court demonstrates its unsoundness. It is to be remembered that this is a suit, not by the Railroad Company, but against the Company, and its purpose is to enforce rates established by the Railroad Commission, which the Railroad Company is resisting. The decision of the Supreme Court upon the grounds of suit and resistance is here for review, and, we must assume, that all that was pertinent to either the court considered, and regarded all else untenable including the contention now urged by counsel. It must, therefore, be rejected.\n The final contention of defendants in error is that Wood v. Vandalia Railroad Co., \n231 U.S. 1\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 7, is res adjudicata of the issues in this case. The suit was by the Railroad Company to restrain the order of the Commission involved in the present litigation, and the ground of attack was, as it is here, that the rates ordered were not compensatory of the service to which they applied. The averments of the bill we held unsustained by the proofs and nothing more was decided. The judgment was not that the order of the Commission was valid but that it was not shown by the bill to be invalid, and the bill was dismissed without prejudice. That is, without preclusion of the right to show it invalid when attempted to be enforced at a subsequent period. Missouri v. Chi., Burl. & Quincy R. R., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 540 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 715. We cannot therefore yield to the contention.\n It follows that the decree must be reversed and it is\n So ordered, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice DAY, Mr. Justice PITNEY, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissent. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVICKSBURG, S. & P.

Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans, La., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Harry B. Anderson, of Memphis, Tenn., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an action instituted by a shipper under the provisions of section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended June 18, 1910 (36 Stat. 539, 554,  13 [Comp. St.  8584]), against various carriers, based upon an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission for the payment of money found due as reparation for the exacting of an unreasonable rate for the transportation of 'box shooks' in carload lots from Vicksburg, Miss., to Port Arthur, Tex., which the carriers refused to pay.\n It will be necessary to consider only the liability of the defendant, the Vickburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter referred to as the Vicksburg Company.\n The petition in the case was filed in the United Stated District Court for the Western Division of the Southern District of Mississippi, and the plaintiff therein, defendant in error, for the purpose of showing the venue, allowed in section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act, supra, alleged that the defendant, the Vicksburg Company, was operating a part of its road within that district. The Vicksburg Company challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court by a plea in abatement, denying that it owned or operated a railroad in the district at the time or for many months before the petition was filed, and averred that the person on whom summons was served was not at the time its agent.\n The shipper prevailed in both lower courts.\n The venue provision of the Interstate Commerce Act allows such an action as we have here to be commenced in any district 'through which the road of the carrier runs,' and it is contended, first, that the Vicksburg Company did not have a road running through the district of suit, and that, therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction over the case. \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 411]\n\u00a0\n It is stipulated that the Vicksburg Company is a Louisiana corporation and that at the times involved it owned a railroad extending through Louisiana to Delta Point, a station on the west bank of the Mississippi river, opposite Vicksburg. Its cars were ferried to and fro across the river and were hauled by the Alabama & Vicksburg Railroad Company, hereinafter called the Alabama Company, over its rails to freight and passenger stations in Vicksburg. The Vicksburg and the Alabama Companies shared the expense of freight and ticket offices in Vicksburg, at which tickets were sold and bills of lading issued by the Vicksburg Company from Vicksburg to various points on its line. The Vicksburg Company filed passenger and freight tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission without any division of rates with the Alabama Company, that company being paid on a mileage basis for the service which it rendered east of the river. It is also stipulated 'that exactly the same arrangement is now in force between' the Vicksburg and Alabama Companies 'as was in effect before the United States government took control of these two roads.'\n Thus the mileage, passenger, freight and tariff publication arrangements which the Vicksburg Company had with the Alabama Company plainly were equivalent in practice to a lease of the road of that company to the Vicksburg Company for its transportation purposes, and the dealings of the Vicksburg Company with the public and with the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to traffic to and from Vicksburg were precisely the same as if it had owned or had leased the Alabama Company's tracks. The applicable venue provision of the Interstate Commerce Act does not require that the carrier shall be the owner of a railroad in the district, but only that its road must run through it, and we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in concluding that the tracks of the Alabama Company east of the river, in the district \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 412]\n\u00a0\n of suit, under the circumstances of operation as the parties stipulated them to be, constituted them the road of the Vicksburg Company within the meaning of the act.\n It is next contended that the person on whom summons was served was not, at the time, an agent of the Vicksburg Company.\n The return of the marshal is that he executed the writ 'by handing a true copy of this summons and petition for judgment to Austin King, freight agent for the Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railway Company.' The plea in abatement denied on 'information, knowledge and belief' of counsel that King was at the time of service an agent of either of the defendants. No evidence whatever was introduced to sustain this plea and in support of it sole reliance is placed upon the stipulation that the government was in control of the lines of the Vicksburg Company at the time the petition was filed.\n The unreasonable rate for which the reparation order was made was exacted on shipments moving long prior to the taking over of the railroads by the government in December, 1917, and there being no evidence that King was not the agent of the Vicksburg Company, the return of the marshal was properly accepted by both lower courts as conclusive. He may not have been in the employ of the Director General of Railroads at all and it was entirely possible for him to have been serving as agent for both the Director and the company.\n Since the shipment for which reparation was allowed moved prior to the taking over of the railroads by the United States government, as against the objection of government control, we think the provision of section 10 of the Federal Railroad Control Act (40 Stat. 451, 456 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j]) is applicable and ample to support the jurisdiction, viz., that 'actions at law or suits in equity may be brought by and against such carriers and judgments rendered as now provided by law; and in any action at law or suit in equity \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 413]\n\u00a0\n against the carrier, no defense shall be made thereto upon the ground that the carrier is an instrumentality or agency of the federal government.'\n It is further claimed that the act of Congress abolishing the Commerce Court (38 Stat. 208, 219 [Comp. St.  992, 994]), repealed by implication the provisions of section 16, supra, permitting such reparation suits as we have here to be filed in the District Court for any district 'through which the road of the carrier runs' and that for this reason the District Court was without jurisdiction.\n The plaintiff was a Michigan corporation and if the provisions of section 16 referred to had been repealed at the time the case was commenced the venue was improperly laid and the court was without jurisdiction.\n The argument is that the act of Congress abolishing the Commerce Court, in restoring to the District Courts the jurisdiction which had been vested exclusively in that court provided that 'the venue of any suit hereafter brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside ... any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial district wherein is the residence of the party of any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made' (38 Stat. 219 [Comp. St.  994]), and that this provision for venue is so inconsistent with that of section 16, supra, allowing suit to be commenced, on an order for the payment of money, in any district through which the road of the carrier runs, that the latter must be regarded as repealed by implication.\n This contention is much too artificial and unsubstantial for us to consider it in much detail. It is enought to say that the two principal amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 show that it has been the plainly expressed policy of Congress to make the prosecution of suits upon reparation orders for the payment of money progressively easier and less expensive for the shipper by enlarging the venue provisions of them, doubtless because \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 414]\n\u00a0\n many such claims are so small that if suit could be maintained by the owners only in distant jurisdictions a large part of them would be abandoned. Act 1887, 24 Stat. 379, 384,  16; Act 1906, 34 Stat. 584, 590 ,  5; Act 1910, 36 Stat. 539, 554,  13 (Comp. St.  8584). The Commerce Court repealing act was a section of an appropriation act and dealt with venue only to the extent necessary to redistribute the jurisdiction of the court abolished and in terms it repealed only acts or parts of acts in so far 'as they relate to the establishment of the Commerce Court' and again so far as 'inconsistent with the foregoing provisions relating to the Commerce Court.' 38 Stat. 219, 221 (Comp. St.  1003). The venue provided for, and relied upon in this suit, was for suits in the Circuit (District) Court on an order for the payment of money, and of such suits the Commerce Court never had jurisdiction.\n The contention that Congress intended by implication to repeal and cut down to such narrow limits the venue which has gradually been so liberally extended cannot be entertained. The terms of the repealing act do not justify it and we cannot doubt that if such purpose had been intended it would not have been left to inference and implication but would have been clearly expressed.\n Coming to the essentials of the case. When the cause came on for trial on its merits, a jury being duly waived, it is recited in the entry of the judgment that it was stipulated that either party might use in evidence any part of the record and evidence introduced in the hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, which resulted in the order relied upon, and that any of the printed reports and findings of the Commission might be used. It is also recited that the plaintiff introduced the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the order of the Commission directing the payment of the money sued for, and rested its case, and that 'the defendant introduced no evidence.' Thereupon the \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 415]\n\u00a0\n court found that the report and order of the Commission constituted prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the order with interest and an attorney's fee.\n There was no request made by the carriers for any ruling of law, and no exception whatever was taken during the trial. There being no special findings of fact by the court, its general finding has the effect of a verdict of a jury (R. S. 649 [Comp. St.  1587]), is conclusive upon all matters of fact, and there not being any exceptions to rulings of law in the progress of the trial, the review in this court is limited to the sufficiency of the complaint (R. S. 700 [Comp. St.  1668]). Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125; St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n166 U.S. 388\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 608; Lehnen v. Dickson, \n148 U.S. 71\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 481.\n The contention that the petition does not state a cause of action against the carriers first appears in the assignment of errors in the Circuit Court of Appeals, after an elaborate answer and adverse judgment in the District Court. However, the petition avers that the shipper filed its petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission, claiming that it had been charged an unreasonable rate, that upon hearing the Commission entered an order for the payment of money 'as reparation on account of unreasonable rate exacted for the transportation' of its freight, that the order required payment to be made by a date named, that the carriers had refused payment when demanded, and that the suit was instituted under the Act to Regulate Commerce of 1887, and amendments thereof. To this petition copies of the report and order of the Commission were attached. These allegations were amply sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute, that the petition in such a case shall set forth briefly the causes for which damages are claimed and the order of the Commission in the premises. 36 Stat. 539, 554,  13. \n\n[256 U.S. 408, 416]\n\u00a0\n It is also contended that it was not competent for the Interstate Commerce Commission to enter the order which was made for the reason that before the hearing by the Commission the carriers had filed an application for relief under section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended in 1910 (Comp. St.  8566), which had not been disposed of at the time the order was made, and that therefore the provision of that act that no rates or charges lawfully existing at the time of the passage of the amendment should be required to be changed until the determination of such application by the Commission, was applicable. To this it is sufficient to say that it appears from the Commission's first report that immediately after the filing of the complaint with the Commission the carriers amended their tariffs so as to correct the unreasonable rate which was complained of under section 3 of the act (Comp. St.  8565), and we quite agree with the Commission that whatever the application under section 4 may have been ( there is no copy of it in the record), such amendment removed the occasion for further suspension of action by the Commission under the provision quoted. The Commission aptly says that the rate then on file conformed 'to the requirements of the fourth section and defendants' application in so far as this adjustment is concerned has no further office to perform.'\n The final contention that the facts found by the Interstate Commerce Commission were so adopted by the District Court as to become special findings of fact by that court which may be reviewed by this court without exception being taken to any of them is too trivial to deserve discussion.\n It results that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALL v.

The defendant answered, the case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts, and judgment was rendered in favor of the taxpayer, the defendant in error. The case is properly here by writ of error. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254.\n The defendant in error was not a trader or dealer in stocks or bonds, but occasionally purchased and sold one or the other for the purpose of changing his investments.\n Three transactions are involved.\n The first relates to bonds of the International Navigation Company, purchased in 1909, for $191,000 and sold in 1916 for the same amount. The market value of these bonds on March 1, 1913, was $151,845, and the tax in dispute was assessed on the difference between this amount and the amount for which they were sold in 1916, viz. $39,155.\n The trial court held that this apparent gain was capital assets and not taxable income under the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant in error for the amount of the tax which he had paid.\n The ground upon which this part of the judgment was justified below is held to be erroneous in No. 608, Merchants' Loan & Trust Co., as Trustee, v. Julius F. Smietanka, Collector of Internal Revenue, \n255 U.S. 509\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 386, 65 L. Ed. --, this day decided, but, since the owner of the stock did not realize any gain on his original investment by the sale in 1916, the judgment was right in this respect, and under authority of the opinion and judgment in No. 663, Goodrich v. Ed wards, \n\n[255 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n Collector, \n255 U.S. 527\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 390, 65 L. Ed. --, also rendered this day, this part of the judgment is affirmed.\n The second transaction involved the purchase in 1902 and 1903 of bonds of the International Mercantile Marine Company for $231,300, which were sold in 1916 for $276,150. This purchase was made through an underwriting agreement such that the purchaser did not receive any interest upon the amount paid prior to the allotment to him of the bonds in 1906, and he claimed that interest upon the investment for the time which so elapsed should be added as a part of the cost to him of the bonds. But this claim was properly rejected by the trial court under authority of Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 U.S. 189\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 470\n\n\n It is stipulated that the market value of these bonds on March 1, 1913, was $164,480, and the collector assessed the tax upon the difference between the selling price and this amount, but since the gain to the taxpayer was only the difference between his investment of $231,300 and the amount realized by the sale, $276,150, under authority of No. 663, Goodrich v. Edwards, Collector, this day decided, he was taxable only on $ 44,850.\n The District Court, however, held that any gain realized by the sale was a mere conversion of capital assets, and was not income which could lawfully be taxed. In this respect the court fell into error. The tax was properly assessed, but only upon the difference between the purchase and the selling price of the bonds as stated.\n The third transaction related to stock in the Standard Oil Company of California, received through the same stock dividend involved in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. The District Court, upon authority of that case, properly held that the assessment made and collected upon this dividend should be refunded to the defendant in error.\n It results that as to the profit realized upon the second transaction, as indicated in this opinion, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, but as to the other transac- \n\n[255 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n tions it is affirmed for the reasons and upon the grounds herein stated.\n Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part, and case remanded.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, because of prior decisions of the Court, concur only in the judgment. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEBER ELECTRIC CO. v.

The District Court held claims 1 and 4 valid and infringed, but the Circuit Court of Appeals, while affirming the validity of the claims, reversed the holding that they were infringed. A supposed conflict of this decision as to infringement with one by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, with respect to the same patent, serves to bring the case here for review on writ of certiorari.\n The patent is a simple and, as we shall see, a narrow one. As described in the specification it relates to new and useful improvements in incandescent electric lamp sockets, the principal object of which is to provide a simple and effective automatic lock or connection between the sleeve and the cap of such a socket.\n Nothing new electrically or in the general form of the cap or sleeve is claimed-the invention relates solely to the method of fastening the overlapping cap to the sleeve, or, as it is sometimes called, the shell or casing.\n The validity of the claims involved is conceded in argument, and, having regard to the disclaimer with respect to claims 2 and 3, which has been filed by the petitioner since the decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals, we regard the issue as now narrowed to the infringement of the fourth claim.\n The familiar incandescent lamp consists of a glass bulb, attached to a screw threaded base, adapted to be screwed into a properly insulated block, through which the necessary electrical connections are made, and which is in closed \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 670]\n\u00a0\n by a cylindrical 'sleeve' of sheet metal. In order to compete the lamp this detached sleeve supporting the bulb and inclosing the insulated block must be fitted and securely fastened into the usual cap, which is attached to the wall or fixture, for if the fastening should become loose, the light might fail, or the bulb fall, or a fire hazard be created. To invent a device by which the sleeve and cap could be easily and securely attached to each other and yet be readily detached when desired, was the problem to which the patentee addressed himself, and his solution of it is thus described in the fourth claim of the patent:\n'In a device of the class described, and in combination a pair of members comprising a sheet metal sleeve having a slotted end, and a sheet metal cap adapted to telescopically receive the slotted end of said sleeve, one of said members being provided with a recess, and the other having a correspondingly located transverse slit and the wall on one side thereof displaced to from a projection beveled or inclined toward said recessed member and terminating abruptly at said slit, whereby said members are adapted to automatically interlock with a snap action when telescopically applied to each other, and to be released by manual compression of said slotted sleeve, substantially as described.'\n\n To make the device thus described, it was only necessary to cut two transverse slits, each about one-quarter of an inch in length, in opposite sides of the flange of an ordinary cap, and to then, with a punch or die, force outward the upper edges or walls of the slits to the extent desired to create the necessary 'recesses' which must 'terminate' at the lower, sharp edges of the slits. A similar operation on a slotted sleeve would produce a similar result, but when viewed from the outer surface of the sleeve the recesses would become the projections of the quoted fourth claim. When such sleeve is teles copically \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 671]\n\u00a0\n applied to-pushed or pressed into-the cap, it is obvious that with the recesses in the cap and the projections in the sleeve properly positioned and of a suitable size, when the projections shall register with the recesses, the resiliency of the metal will cause the two to engage with a snap action and the sharp lower edges of the slots in the cap will then prevent the cap and sleeve from being separated by a longitudinal movement only, until the sleeve shall be manually compressed to release the projections from the recesses.\n It is to be noted, for it will be of significance in the interpretation of the claim involved, that it is required that the projections on the sleeve shall be 'beveled or inclined toward said recessed member,' and in the specification it is provided that the projections shall be 'beveled or inclined from the inner end of the sleeve toward the outer end.' With such construction it would seem plain, even without the exhibits, which show it to be true, that, friction aside, projections so beveled or inclined could readily be released by rotative movement from similarly shaped recesses without compression of the sleeve.\n It was admitted at the bar that sockets made as specified in the patent in suit were never put upon the market, but the record shows that with a feature added which is covered by another patent owned by petitioner, the socket met with large commercial success. This other patent is No. 916,812 and was granted March 30, 1909, to the patentee of the patent in suit and two others, on an application filed July 18, 1904. Figure 8 from the drawings of this patent, showing the cap and sleeve of the petitioner's socket as manufactured by it, will aid in describing the additional 'improvement' which it made to the device of the patent in suit and will also be of service in comparing this device with what is claimed to be the infringing socket of the respondent. \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 672]\n\u00a0\n This patent is also for improvements in incandescent electric light sockets and contains 14 claims, of which only the terms of the first need be noticed. It claims as new and useful 'a pair of tubular, sheet metal members, one adapted to telescopically receive the other, having mutually abutting cut-metal edges on the respective members (the slot 19 in the cap and projection 20 in the sleeve), to prevent relative rotative movement, and automatically interlocking means\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n for preventing a telescopic movement of separation of one member from the other (the recesses 17 in the cap and the projections 15 in the sleeve ), said means permitting, without manipulation thereof, the telescopic application of the members to each other.' This language, with slight additions and omissions, not significant, is repeated in claims 3, 13, and 14.\n This device for preventing 'relative rotative movement' of the cap on the sleeve is the feature which the petitioner added to the socket of the patent in suit before putting it upon the market, and it consists, as the figure supra shows, in the open slot (19) cut to the edge of the \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 673]\n\u00a0\n flange of the cap, into which passes the projection on the sleeve (20) when the two are 'telescopically applied' to each other. This projection ( 20) is formed by cutting two longitudinal slits in the sleeve and then pressing outward the narrow strip of metal between them. It is perfectly true, as stated in 4 of the claims and as asserted with much emphasis in the specification, that this added device effectively prevents any relative rotative movement of the cap and sleeve upon each other.\n Coming now to the construction of the respondent, which it is claimed infringes the fourth claim of the patent in suit.\n This (respondent's) socket has been manufactured since 1909, under patent No. 927,344, and it may most readily be described by reference to the following, Figure 3 of the drawing, which was a part of the specification of the patent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It will be seen from this drawing that instead of outwardly extending recesses in the flange of the cap, formed \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 674]\n\u00a0\n by slits and displacing of the metal, such as are in the petitioner's socket, respondent's cap has four inwardly projecting lugs (19), each of which is a separate piece of metal riveted to the flange. Each of these lugs is circular in outline, with a flat inner end or face and presents abrupt shoulders on opposite sides. In the upper edge of the sleeve are three bayonet slots of the familiar form (14), so positioned that the studs on the cap may enter them when the sleeve is slipped into the cap, but when the sleeve has been telescoped, or pushed, into the cap so that the lugs have been pressed to the end or bottom of the longitudinal part of the bayonet slots (14) rotation of the sleeve is obviously necessary to bring them into the transverse parts of the slots, so that the two members will be locked against longitudinal separation. (No such rotative movement of the two members is mentioned in the patent in suit, it is expressly provided against in petitioner's second patent, and it is not possible in its commercial socket.)\n This rotative movement accomplishes a second result.\n Reference to the figure, supra, shows a longitudinal slot in the sleeve, which in the key socket affords a passage for the key, but in the keyless socket is narrower, and serves only to render the sleeve compressible. To the left of this slot in the sleeve is cut a round hole ( 15) so positioned that when three of the lugs in the cap are brought by the rotative movement to the ends of the transverse parts of the bayonet slots the fourth end will snap into the hole (15). This hole (15) is placed in such a relative position that when the three lugs enter the longitudinal part of the bayonet slots, the fourth stud rides upon the metal near the edge of the slot in the sleeve, and to facilitate this movement the corner of the slot (16) is bent slightly inward. Thus the adjustment of the studs in the cap is practically a universal adjustment between the cap and shell, so that if any one lug is in \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 675]\n\u00a0\n position to enter any bayonet slot two others will be in position to enter the other bayonet slots and the fourth will be in a position to enter the hole (15) when the sleeve and cap have been so pressed together that the ( three) other studs have reached the ends of the longitudinal part of the bayonet slots and the rotation described of the one upon the other has been completed. A slight compression of the sleeve suffices to release the members when desired.\n This description shows that the structural features of the two sockets are strikingly different. Instead of slits and outwardly extending recesses in the cap of the one there are inwardly extended studs riveted to the cap of the other. And instead of slits and outward protections of the sleeve to lock by snap action with recesses in the cap against longitudinal movement in the one, there are the bayonet slots in the sleeve to lock with studs in the cap of the other to accomplish the same result without snap action. But these different constructions not only differ radically in structural features but they do not function in the same manner, for locking against longitudinal movement in the one is by snap action upon direct longitudinal thrust of the sleeve into the cap, while the other requires first a longitudinal movement or thrust, and then a rotative movement, without which it is entirely ineffective, whereby it locks against longitudinal movement without snap action.\n But it is argued that the infringement lies especially in the locking hole (15) in respondent's socket and the associated lug which operate by snap action and afford a positive lock against rotation of the two members on each other.\n The sufficient answer to this is that the patent in suit makes no suggestion of a lock against the rotative movement of the cap and sleeve on each other and contains no disclosure providing for it, but, on the contrary, because \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 676]\n\u00a0\n the beveled sides which are required by claim 4 for the projections on the sleeve permitted such movement, a subsequently patented addition was added to prevent it. The petitioner cannot read into the patent in suit the additional slot in the cap and the additional projection on the sleeve of patentee's second patent, and without them there is no lock against rotative movement in the socket of the first patent to be infringed by the stud snapping into the locking hole of the sleeve of respondent's socket.\n This is sufficient to dispose of the case, but we also fully agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the prior art, the file wrapper and the second patent to the same patentee, No. 916,812, supra, require that the expressions in the fourth claim 'telescopically received' and 'telescopically applied' must be restricted to a direct longitudinal movement or thrust of the sleeve into the cap and that for this reason the construction of respondent requiring a rotary movement to render it effective, does not infringe that of the petitioner.\n In the application for the patent in suit this fourth claim, originally the seventh, read as we have quoted it omitting the words in italics. In this form it was promptly rejected by the Patent Office on reference to the Oetting patent, No. 642,825, and to the Kenney patent, No. 712,686, and it is clear that the chief concern of the applicant thereafter was to distinguish his construction from that of Kenney, which is very similar to that of respondent. The Kenney socket has lugs in the cap and bayonet slots in the sleeve, to lock against longitudinal movement, as respondent's socket has, and also slots with open ends and locking holes similarly placed in the sleeve to lock against rotary movement when the lugs in the cap engage with them. The chief difference between the Kenney and respondent's socket is that in Kenney the lug passes down the slot to a position opposite the locking hole and \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 677]\n\u00a0\n then with the rotary movement mounts and rides over the narrow strip of metal-'the bridge'-into the hole, while in the respondent's socket the lugs having plain faces ride on the metal near to the edge of the slot during the longitudinal movement and from that position pass into the locking holes with the rotative movement.\n When his application was rejected by the Patent Office on reference to the Kenney patent thus described, the applicant, without objection or appeal, amended his claim 7 (numbering it 4) by adding the words in italics, and in his explanatory 'remarks,' when submitting these amendments, it was said:\n'Claim 4, originally 7, is now drawn to a specific structure, having advantages not found in either of the references cited. By transversely slitting the sheet metal shell and displacing the wall on one side of said slit to form a beveled or inclined projection the parts are permitted to be applied to each other by simply inserting one within the other, without manually compressing the inner member.'\n\n And again:\n'Kenney's device is adapted to unlock by simply rotating one member upon another in the same manner that the parts are locked together, no manual compression of the inner member being necessary.'\n\n Thus the patentee, in order to avoid infringing Kenney's construction, voluntarily restricted himself to a 'specific structure' operative when the sleeve was 'simply' inserted in the cap, without suggesting any rotary movement whatever, but, on the contrary, by his reference to Kenney as locking and unlocking by 'simply rotating one member upon the other,' clearly implying that no such rotary movement was necessary in the adjustment of his socket. Having thus narrowed his claim against rotary movement in order to obtain a patent the patentee may not by construction, or by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, give to the claim the larger scope which it might have had without the amendments, which amount to a \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 678]\n\u00a0\n disclaimer of rotation as an operative feature of his devise. Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 593, 598\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 77, 80\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 24.\n But that no rotary movement was implied in the use of 'telescopically received' and 'telescopically applied' in the patent in suit is further unmistakably shown by the frequent use of the same or equivalent expressions in the specification and claims of patentee's later patent, No. 916,812, supra, in which claims 1, 3, 13, and 14 relate almost wholly to an improvement which renders rotation of the members one upon the other impossible and which petitioner added to the construction of the patent in suit before putting the sockets upon the market. That the inventor did not intend to claim, and that he certainly did not disclose, that any such rotary movement was necessary in his socket as was required to render the socket of the respondent effective, is, we think, for these reasons, so clear that it is not necessary to consider the dictionary definitions of the words used, upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals, with sound reason, relied in reaching this same conclusion.\n For the reasons thus elaborated, we conclude that the socket of the respondent does not infringe the fourth claim of the patent in suit because there is no claim made therein of a lock against rotative movement of the cap and sleeve upon each other, and also because the file-wrapper and the subsequent patent show that the disclosure is, and was intended to be, limited to a construction operative by direct longitudinal movement or thrust without such rotative movement.\n The contention, pressed strenuously upon our attention, that the added open slot in the cap and projection on the sleeve provided for in the second patent were devised simply to secure the alignment of the projections and recesses of the first patent in making telescopic application of the two members to each other, is not convincing \n\n[256 U.S. 668, 679]\n\u00a0\n in the presence of the fact that claims 1, 3, 13, and 14 of the second patent are devoted almost wholly to claiming that this improved construction is intended 'to prevent relative rotative movement' of one member upon the other, while only claims 11 and 12 refer, quite incidentally, to what is now claimed to be the chief function of the added parts, that of a guide to the positioning of the recesses and projections of the first patent with reference to each other. Without a guide, the difficulty should not be very great of aligning projections and recesses distant from each other but a fraction of an inch when the edges of the cap and sleeve are in contact. The constructions held by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit to infringe the patent in suit, were so essentially different from that of the respondent that we regard discussion of them as quite unnecessary.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to claims 1 and 4 must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEEDS, INC, v. U S(1921)\nNo. 558\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, of New Work City, for plaintiffs in erro. \n\n[255 U.S. 109, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs in error, having been convicted and sentenced under an indictment containing eight counts, one of which, the sixth, was eliminated at the trial, prosecute this direct writ of error. All the counts charged violations of the fourth section of the Lever Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff)-the first, a conspiracy under the section to exact and to aid and abet in exacting excessive prices for certain necessaries, that is, articles of wearing apparel; and each of the others a specific sale of such an article at an unjust and unreasonable rate or charge.\n The indictment was demurred to because of its repugnancy to the Constitution upon these grounds: (1) Want of power in Congress because of a state of peace; (2) that the provisions in question were so vague and wanting in standard of criminality as to constitute a mere delegation by Congress of legislative power in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and, furthermore, because by virtue of the exemptions which they contained, they denied to defendants the equal protection of the laws. The demurrer was overruled and at the trial which followed the grounds of demurrer were again held to be without merit and the questions which it presented were saved and are pressed in the argument at bar as grounds for reversal.\n As the only difference between the charges in the Cohen Grocery Co. Case, \n255 U.S. 81\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 298, 65 L. Ed. --, and those in this, is the fact that here in one of the counts there was a charge of conspiracy to exact excessive prices, it follows that the ruling in the Cohen Case is decisive here, unless the provision as to conspiracy to exact excessive prices is sufficiently specific to create a standard and to inform the \n\n[255 U.S. 109, 111]\n\u00a0\n accused of the accusation against him and thus make it not amenable to the ruling in the Cohen Case. But, as we are of the opinion that there is no ground for such distinction, but, on the contrary, that the charge as to conspiracy to exact excessive prices is equally as wanting in standard and equally as vague as the provision as to unjust and unreasonable rates and charges dealt with in the Cohen Case, it follows, for reasons stated in that case, that the judgment in this must be reversed and the case remanded, with directions to set aside the sentence and quash the indictment.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, concurring.\n In this case, as in No. 324, United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 U.S. 81\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 298, 65 L. Ed. --, while concurring in the judgment of the court, I am unable to yield assent to the grounds upon which it is based.\n Most of the counts in the indictment upon which plaintiffs in error were convicted allege specific violations of that provision of the Act of October 22, 1919 (chapter 80, tit. 1,  2, 41 Stat. 297, 298, amending section 4 of the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 277), which declares it unlawful 'to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge, in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries'; the alleged offenses having consisted in the sale of specific articles of merchandise at excessive prices. Respecting these, my views are expressed in the concurring opinion in the Cohen Grocery Co. Case. \n\n[255 U.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n The remaining count alleges a conspiracy to exact, and to aid and abet in exacting, excessive prices for certain specified necessaries. I see no unconstitutional lack of definiteness in the prohibition of a conspiracy to exact excessive prices for necessaries. In the absence of a statutory definition of, or method of determining, standard prices, with which to compare the prices alleged to be excessive, the natural standard, according to which this provision of the act ought to be interpreted, is that adopted in the ordinary transactions of men, and adhered to by the common law time out of mind-the standard of fair market value; the price prevailing under current conditions of supply and demand, uninfluenced by manipulation. So construed, I regard this provision as clearly constitutional, and need only refer to Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 780. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 221-223, 34 Sup. Ct. 853, is distinguishable. In that case it was conceded, arguendo, that a standard fixed by market value under fair competition and normal market conditions was admissible; and the statute was denounced only because in truth it did not apply this standard, but called for an estimate of what prices would have been under nonexistent and imaginary conditions. To the same effect, Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 634, 638\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 924\n\n\n I assume (as the court has this day held) that the provision declaring it unlawful 'to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries' is unconstitutional for want of a definite standard; but this does not carry with it the provision now in question, since by section 22 of the Act of August 10, 1917 (40 Stat. 283 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 oo]), it is declared that if any clause, sentence, paragraph, or part of the act be adjudged to be invalid, this shall not affect or invalidate the remainder, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, etc., directly involved-a conclusive declaration \n\n[255 U.S. 109, 113]\n\u00a0\n by Congress that the various provisions of this complicated statute shall be regarded as separable.\n The record shows, however, that the trial court repeatedly rejected testimony offered by defendants for the purpose of showing the market value of the goods in question at times material to the controversy, and that exceptions were duly allowed. The effect of the rulings was to deprive defendants of the benefit of this standard, by which the jury might have determined whether the prices defendants agreed to exact for the merchandise were excessive; and for this reason only I concur in the reversal of the judgment of conviction as to this count. As to the other counts I concur in the reversal upon the ground that the statute, in declaring it unlawful 'to make nay unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries,' does not include the exaction of an excessive price for merchandise sold.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN FUEL CO. v.

The libel alleged that the injury was caused by coal negligently permitted to fall from a steel hoisting bucket.\n Relying upon the California Workmen's Compensation Act of 1913 (St. 1913, p. 279), the Industrial Accident Commission granted an award in favor of the widow and children, which the Supreme Court of the state annulled August 6, 1917-a year and a day subsequent to the death.\n Shortly thereafter-August 21st-the widow and children began an admiralty suit in personam against the petitioner in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, wherein they alleged that the accident resulted from its negligence and prayed for damages. Later respondent, having been appointed administrator, filed an amended libel with like allegations and prayer, and upon this the cause was ultimately tried. Petitioner denied liability and relied upon section 340, subsection 3, California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that an action for damages consequent upon death caused by wrongful act, or negligence shall be brought within one year. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[257 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n The District Court held in favor of the administrator and awarded substantial damages; the Circuit Court of Appeals has sent up the whole cause under our direction.\n It is established doctrine that no suit to recover damages for the death of a human being caused by negligence, may be maintained in the admiralty courts of the United States under the general maritime law. At the common law no civil action lies for an injury resulting from death. The maritime law as generally accepted by maritime nations leaves the matter untouched and in practice each of them has applied the same rule for the sea which it maintains on land.

Ct. 664.\n How far this rule of nonliability adopted and enforced by our admiralty courts in the absence of an applicable statute may be modified, changed or supplemented by state legislation has been the subject of consideration here but no complete solution of the question has been announced.\n In Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, and Ex parte McNiel, 13 Wall. 236, the power of a state to legislate concerning subjects maritime in their nature was under discussion, and it was pointed out that as to certain local matters a state statute may grant rights which will be enforced in an admiralty court.\n In American Steamboat Co. v. Chace, 16 Wall. 531, 532, the decedent was killed on navigable waters within Rhode Island. Relying upon the death statute of that state his administrator sued and recovered in one of its courts. This court affirmed the judgment. Whether an admiralty court could have entertained a proceeding based upon the statute was mooted but not determined.\n Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 U.S. 99\n, arose out a collision between steamboats on the Ohio river within the limits \n\n[257 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n of Indiana whose statute gave a right of action for death caused by wrongful act, and a recovery in the state court was affirmed here. The defense rested primarily upon the erroneous theory that the statute encroached upon the commercial powers of Congress. There was no discussion of the point now directly presented. In Butler v. Boston, etc., Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 557, 558\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 612, the point was raised but left without expression of opinion.\n The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 405\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 133, an admiralty proceeding for limitation of liability, affirmed the validity of claims for damages resulting from death at sea based upon the statute of Delaware where the vessel's owner had been incorporated.\n The inferior federal courts on the admiralty side have enforced rights of action based upon death statutes holding they had jurisdiction as the claims grew out of torts on navigable waters and were maritime in their nature. The City of Norwalk, (D. C.) 55 Fed. 98, and the cases cited. See also Hughes on Admiralty (2d Ed.) pp. 228, 230, et seq.\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R.

Ct. 112, and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 U.S. 149\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, we have recently discussed the theory under which the general maritime law became a part of our national law and pointed out the inability of the states to change its general features so as to defeat uniformity-but the power of a state to make some modifications or supplements was affirmed. And we further held that rights and liabilities in respect of torts upon the sea ordinarily depend upon the rules accepted and applied in admiralty courts which are controlling wherever suit may be instituted. Under this view, American Steamboat Co. v. Chace and Sherlock v. Alling support the right to recover under a local statute in an admiralty court for \n\n[257 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n death occurring on navigable waters within the state when caused by tort there committed.\n As the logical result of prior decisions we think it follows that where death upon such waters follows from a maritime tort committed on navigable waters within a state whose statutes give a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the admiralty courts will entertain a libel in personam for the damages sustained by those to whom such right is given. The subject is maritime and local in character and the specified modification of or supplement to the rule applied in admiralty courts when following the common law, will not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, nor interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra.\n The California Code of Civil Procedure, section 340, prescribes one year as the period within which an action for death caused by wrongful action or negligence shall be brought. It is admitted that under the circumstances here presented suit against petitioner if instituted in a court of that state would have been barred, and we are of opinion that the same limitation must be enforced in respect of the admiralty proceeding. It was so decided in The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 213, 214\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 140, a proceeding in rem begun in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The steamer belonged to the port of Philadelphia where she was duly enrolled and the accident occurred upon navigable waters within Massachusetts. The Pennsylvania statute permitted suit for damages resulting from death and provided that 'the action shall be brought within one year from the death, and not thereafter.' The Massachusetts statute provided that in case of death resulting from the wrongful action of a corporation, the executor might recover by indictment a fine not exceeding $5,000, and further, that indictments \n\n[257 U.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n against a corporation for loss of life shall be prosecuted within one year from the injury causing the death. Through Mr. Chief Justice Waite, this court said:\n'The statutes create a new legal liability, with the right to a suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within twelve months, and not otherwise. The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone. It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all. No one will pretend that the suit in Pennsylvania, or the indictment in Massachusetts, could be maintained if brought or found after the expiration of the year, and it would seen to be clear that, if the admiralty adopts the statute as a rule of right to be administered within its own jurisdiction, it must take the right subject to the limitations which have been made a part of its existence. It matters not that no rights of innocent parties have attached during the delay. Time has been made of the essence of the right, and the right is lost if the time is disregarded. The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.'\n\n See also Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451, 453\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 692\n\n\n'An act relating to the maintenance of actions for death on the high seas and other navigable waters,' approved March 30, 1920 (chapter 111, 41 Stat. 537), gives a right of action for damages resulting from death caused by wrongful act, neglect or default occurring on the high seas beyond one marine league from the shore. It expressly directs:\n\n'That the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action of remedies for death shall not be affected by this act. Nor shall this act apply to the Great Lakes or to any waters within the territorial limits of any State, or to any navigable waters in the Panama Canal Zone.' Section 7.\n\n In the present cause the District Court rightly assumed jurisdiction of the proceedings, but erred in holding the \n\n[257 U.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n right of action was not barred under the state statute of limitation.

United States (No. 134) \n255 U.S. 339\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 329, 65 L. Ed . --. It was argued at the same time as the latter case, and, as in that case, it is to recover amounts withheld by the accounting officers of the government as land-grant deductions in settlements for transportation of the personal effects of army officers.\n It is asserted, however, that this action differs from No. 134 in that the Western Pacific Railroad was not completed and in operation until 1910, so that it is said 'there is absent the element of previous course of dealings relied upon by the government, and in that there was introduced in evidence' testimony to the effect that the first voucher presented for transportation service was for full tariff rates.\n It is stated in the findings that the real claimants in the case are the receivers of the railroad but that its name is used to designate claimants for convenience, and that between June 10, 1910, and March 18, 1915, the railroad at the request of the United States, as shipper or consignor, received from other railroad companies at connecting points, on government bills of lading, and transported over its lines, the effects and property of officers of the United States army, changing stations under orders.\n It further appears that from June 10, 1910 to March 18, 1915, the presentation of claims, character of vouchers accompanying the same, action thereon by the accounting officers of the government, payment and receipt were the same as in No. 134, except it is found that--\n'Settlements for charges on freight shipments on government bills of lading were in charge of one David A. McLean, head of the freight revising bureau in the office of the general auditor \n\n[255 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n of the plaintiff [appellant] in San Francisco.'\n\n And it is found:\n'It was the practice of said McLean to revise the bills of lading and apply the rates applicable on the traffic at commercial rates, make the land-grant deduction and compute the freight charges at the net rate. After a month's bill of lading had been revised it was his practice to check up with the quartermaster's office and adjust differences, where there were any differences, as to the correct charges. He then caused the claims to be stated on the prescribed voucher form and after being signed they, with the bills of lading attached, were forwarded to the quartermaster for payment. It appears that to the best recollection of said McLean he stated the first of these claims, during this period, at commercial rates, but being informed by the quartermaster's office of the applicability of land- grant rates under the holding of the Comptroller and the established practice, he restated the claim on a land-grant basis. It further appears that he had just come to the service of the plaintiff; that he had had no experience in the rendering of bills for government transportation; that as soon as he learned the custom with reference thereto he rendered bills for transportation of the character here involved at land-grant rates and continued to do so during all of said period. The rendering of the bill referred to at commercial rates, if in fact he so rendered it, was due to his ignorance of established practice and not because of any intention to question the propriety of the practice or to claim as a matter of right the application of commercial rates. It is not shown that at any time during this entire period he ever questioned the application of land- grant rates to such transportation or protested any settlements on that account, but all bills rendered by him, except as stated, were rendered at land-grant rates, and when so rendered he did not expect any further compensation and never expected compensation at other than land-grant rates until after the decision \n\n[255 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Case by this court.'1\n\n It is further found that--\n'The difference between the amounts claimed by the plaintiff and paid on account of said transportation during said period and the amount it would receive had it claimed and been paid full commercial rates without landgrant deduction is $5,760.89.'\n\n The rulings of the accounting officers are detailed in the findings.\n From March 18, 1915, to August 1, 1916, it is found that appellant was entitled 'to payment at the regular tariff rates applicable.' The government accounting officers, notwithstanding, 'issued warrants for net amounts after making land-grant deductions.' Against this appellant protested. The amounts deducted amounted to $851.78.\n The conclusion of the court was, and its decision was, that appellant was entitled to judgment for the sum of $851.78 and that as to the other amounts its petition should be dismissed. For this the court gave as authority its decision in the Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co. v. United States, No. 33301, 54 Ct. Cl. 125, decided on the same day.\n The opinion in the latter case is set out in the record at page 16.\n The argument in this case is the same as in No. 134, and rests on the same considerations. This case, as we have seen, was decided on the authority of Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co. v. United States and the latter on the B. & O. R. R. Co. v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 468, and No. 134.\n A contention, however, is made that was not made in No. 134; that is, that--\n'Under the Interstate Commerce Law the final carrier (appellant was final carrier of the transportation with which this case is concerned) is not \n\n[255 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n only empowered to collect the through charge, but is burdened with the duty and obligation of collecting the full published tariff rate and is powerless to relieve or release a shipper or consignee from any part of the same.'\n\n The further contention is that within this obligation is the property in the pending case. The immediate answer is that section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8595) permits reduced rates to the United States and that by Conference Ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission No. 33 of February 3, 1908, section 22, is made applicable to property transported for the United States. The transportation in the present case was for the government and in providing for it and paying for it the government performed a governmental service.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 50 Ct.

Rush Taggart and John G. Milburn, both of New York City, W. B. Spencer, of New Orleans, La., and Francis R. Stark and Joseph L. Egan, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n\n[256 U.S. 566, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1917, the Western Union Telegraph Company delivered to Esteve Bros. & Co., at New Orleans, La., an unrepeated cable message from the latter's main office at Barcelona, Spain, directing a sale for future delivery of 2,000 bales of cotton. The message actually sent had directed the sale of 200 bales. The error in transmission resulted in a loss to Esteve Bros. & Co. of $31,095. To recover compensation for this loss they sued the Western Union in a state court of Louisiana. The case was removed to the federal District Court, and there was tried by jury upon these additional stipulated facts:\n The message was sent over lines of the Spanish Government Telegraph from Barcelona to Paris and thence over lines of the French government to Havre. There it was delivered to the Western Union, transmitted by its cable to New York City, and thence over its land lines to New Orleans. The error in transmission occurred on these land lines. The charge of $6.60, paid at Barcelona for transmitting the message represented the sum of the local rates on the several connecting lines. The Western Union's share was $ 4.65, and of this $3.75 was apportioned to the cable system and 90 cents to the land lines. This Western Union rate was established by its tariff of telegraph and cable rates, in force since some time prior to June 18, 1910. Under the act of that date (chapter 309, 36 Stat. 554 [Comp. St.  8563]), making telegraph and cable companies subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce, this tariff had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission in May, 1916, by its permission and pursuant to an appropriate resolution of the company. The tariff so filed embodied the long used classification of messages, rules and regulations, including the provision that the company 'shall not \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 569]\n\u00a0\n be liable for mistakes ... in transmission ... of any unrepeated message, beyond the amount of that portion of the tolls which shall accrue to it.' The plaintiffs did not in in fact assent to this limitation of liability. They did not, in sending the message at Barcelona, use a blank containing the provisions so limiting liability. They did not have actual knowledge of the resolution of the company or of the filing of the tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The plaintiffs contended at the trial that in view of the above facts they were entitled to a verdict for the full amount of their loss. The company contended that, since the message had not been repeated, the verdict should be limited to $4.65, the amount received by it as tolls. A verdict was directed for $31,095, with interest; judgment thereon was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (268 Fed. 22), and a petition for writ of certiorari was granted ( \n254 U.S. 624\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 13, 65 L. Ed. --). The sole question presented for our decision is the amount of damages recoverable.\n For more than 50 years prior to the transaction here in suit the Western Union had maintained these two classes of rates for general cable and telegraph service. The usual or basic rate was for service practically at the sender's risk; liability being limited to the amount of the toll collected. Another special rate entitled the sender to have the message repeated back to the point of origin and rendered the company liable in case of mistake or nondelivery up to fifty times the amount of the extra charge. The extra charge for this additional service was for telegrams one- half and for cables one-quarter of the basic rate. In Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n154 U.S. 1\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1098, decided in 1894, this classification of rates and the limitations upon the company's liability were declared by this court to be reasonable and valid, in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence. The \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 570]\n\u00a0\n limitation upon the company's common-law liability was held to be in the nature of contract, and this liability, unlike that of a common carrier, was not an insurer's. It was merely for the damage flowing from failure to use due care in transmission. Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., supra, \n154 U.S. 14\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1098. Since the limitation of liability was in the nature of contract, the provision had to be brought home to the sender of a message in order to be legally binding upon him. Assent by the sender was ordinarily established, if the message was written upon one of the company's blanks which set forth the limitation of liability. Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., supra, \n154 U.S. 25\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1098. Compare Cau v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 663, 48 L Ed. 1053. Whether, in view of long-established practice, the mere sending of a message, although not written on such a blank, imported assent to the usual terms of the rate, involved, then, an issue of fact. See New Jersey Navigation Co. v. Merchant's Bank, 6 How. 344, 383. The question presented for our decision is whether, since the amendment of June 18, 1910, to the Act to Regulate Commerce, the sender is, without assent in fact, bound as matter of law by the provision limiting liability, because it is a part of the lawfully established rate.\n The Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539, 544 (Comp. St.  8563), broadened the scope of the Act to Regulate Commerce to include 'telegraph, telephone and cable companies (whether wire or wireless) engaged in sending messages from [a] state ... to any foreign country.' And whatever may have been the legal incidents of transmitting the message from Barcelona to Havre under Spanish and French law, the Western Union, in sending the message over its own lines from Havre to New Orleans, was governed by the provisions of that act. Galveston, H. & S. A. Ry. Co. v. Woodbury, \n254 U.S. 357\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 114, 65 L. Ed. --. In the third paragraph of section 1 of the amended act Congress provided that messages might be 'classified \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 571]\n\u00a0\n into day, night, repeated, unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, government and such other classes as are just and reasonable, and different rate [might] be charged for the different classes of messages.' Acting, in May, 1916, under the authority of that provision, the Western Union by appropriate action approved the tariff involved in the present case, and by permission of the Interstate Commerce Commission filed with it the tariff, including the provisions here in question. The company was not required so to do by the terms of the act or by any order of the Commission. Compare 25th Annual Report I. C. C. (1911) pp. 5, 6. But the rate, long before established, then formally adopted and filed, was thereafter the only lawful rate for an unrepeated message, and the limitation of liability became the lawful condition upon which it was sent. Postal Tel.-Cable Co. v. Warren-Godwin, \n251 \nU.S. 27, 30\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 69; Clay County Produce Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 44 Interst. Com. Com'n R., 670, 674.\n The lawful rate having been established, the company was by the provisions of section 3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce prohibited from granting to any one an undue preference or advantage over the public generally. For, as stated in Postal Tel.-Cable Co. v. Warren-Codwin Co., supra, \n251 U.S. 30\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 70, the 'act of 1910 was designed to and did subject such companies as to their interstate business to the rule of equality and uniformity of rates.' If the general public upon paying the rate for an unrepeated message accepted substantially the risk of error involved in transmitting the message, the company could not, without granting an undue preference or advantage extend different treatment to the plaintiff here. The limitation of liability was an inherent part of the rate. The company could no more depart from it than it could depart from the amount charged for the service rendered.\n The act of 1910 introduced a new principle into the legal relations of the telegraph companies with their \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 572]\n\u00a0\n patrons which dominated and modified the principles previously governing them. Before the act the companies had a common law liability from which they might or might not extricate themselves according to views of policy prevailing in the several states. Thereafter, for all messages sent in interstate or foreign commerce, the outstanding consideration became that of uniformity and equality of rates. Uniformity demanded that the rate represent the whole duty and the whole liability of the company. It could not be varied by agreement; still less could it be varied by lack of agreement. The rate became, not as before a matter of contract by which a legal liability could be modified, but a matter of law by which a uniform liability was imposed. Assent to the terms of the rate was rendered immaterial, because when the rate is used, dissent is without effect. This principle was established in cases involving the limitation upon a carrier's liability for baggage by Boston & Maine Railroad v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 526, L. R. A. 1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 593, and Galveston, H. & S. A Ry. Co. v. Woodbury, \n254 U.S. 357\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 114, 65 L. Ed. --, decided by this court December 13, 1920. In the former case it was said:\n'If the charges filed were unreasonable, the only attack which could be made upon such regulation [limiting liability] would be by proceedings contesting their reasonableness before the Interstate Commerce Commission. While they were in force they were equally binding upon the railroad company and all passengers whose baggage was transported by carriers in interstate commerce.'\n\n So here the limitation of liability attached to the unrepeated cable rate is binding upon all who send messages to or from foreign countries until it is set aside as unreasonable by the Commission.\n It is strongly argued that the rule is not applicable to the situation before us, because of the difference in the provisions of law which govern the establishment of railroad and of telegraph rates. The railroad rate is established, and can only be established by filing the tariff with \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 573]\n\u00a0\n the Commission. Telegraph companies may initiate rates without filing tariffs with the Commission. Clay County Produce Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., supra. Plaintiffs insist that it is the filing and subsequent publication of the railroad rate which gives it the force of law and requires the shipper to take notice of it. But the contention, by dwelling unduly upon the procedural features of the act, would defeat the end which Congress had in view. Both railroad and telegraph-cable rates are initiated by the carrier. It is true that a railroad rate does not have the force of law, unless it is filed with the Commission. But it is not true that out of the filing of the rate grows the rule of law by which the terms of this lawful rate conclude the passenger. The rule does not rest upon the fiction of constructive notice. It flows from the requirement of equality and uniformity of rates laid down in section 3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8565). Since any deviation from the lawful rate would involve either an undue preference or an unjust discrimination, a rate lawfully established must apply equally to all, whether there is knowledge of it or not. Congress apparently concluded, in the light of discrimination theretofore practiced by railroads among shippers and localities, that in transportation by rail equality could be secured only by provisions involving the utmost definiteness and constant official supervision. Accordingly by section 6 (Comp. St.  8569) it forbade a carrier of goods from engaging in transportation unless its rates had been filed with the Commission; and it prohibited, under heavy penalties, departure in any way from the terms of those rates when filed. In the case of telegraph and cable companies Congress appears to have considered that such stringent provisions were not required to secure the end in view. It did not make filing with the Commission a condition precedent to the existence of a lawful telegraph and cable rate. When, therefore, the Western Union initiated and established this \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 574]\n\u00a0\n reasonable rate, the principle of equality and uniformity laid down in section 3 required that it should have exactly the same force and effect as the rate initiated by a rail carrier and filed according to the provisions of section 6.\n It was suggested that the attempted limitation of liability must fail under the rule recently applied in Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Burke, \n255 U.S. 317\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 283, decided February 28, 1921, because both the alternative rates offered in the Western Union tariff for cable messages were for limited liability, and because, therefore, no offer was made to the sender of a rate under which the company would assume full liability for all losses suffered through its negligence. It is by no means clear that the rule of the Burke Case-established for common carriers of goods-should be applied to telegraph and cable companies. See the primrose Case, supra, \n154 U.S. 14\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1098. In any event, it is not applicable here. The Western Union did not, as in the case of telegrams, offer to send cable messages upon a special valuation to be made by the sender and paid for by an extra charge 'based upon such value equal to one-tenth of 1 per cent. thereof.' But it offered alternative rates for repeated and for unrepeated cable messages. This long-established classification was expressly recognized as just and reasonable for cable as well as for telegraph messages in the amendment made by the Act of June 18, 1910, to section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. The provision in the terms offered by the company is:\n'To guard against mistakes or delays the sender of a cable message should order it repeated, that is, telegraphed back to the originating office for comparison. For this one quarter of the unrepeated message rate is charged in addition. Unless indicated on its face this is an unrepeated message and paid for as such.\n\n'... This company shall not be liable for mistakes or delays in transmission or delivery ... of any un repeated \n\n[256 U.S. 566, 575]\n\u00a0\n message, beyond the amount of that portion of the tolls which shall accrue to this company, ... [nor] of an repeated message, beyond fifty times the extra sum received by this company from the sender for repeating such message over its own lines. ...'\n\n The repeated rate, offering greater accuracy and greater liability in case of error, was open to anyone who wished to pay the extra amount for extra security. Whether the limitation of liability prescribed for the repeated message would be valid as against a sender who had endeavored, by having the message repeated, to secure the greatest care on the part of the company, we have no occasion to decide, because it is not raised by the facts before us. It is enough to sustain the limitation of liability attached to the unrepeated rate that another special rate was offered for messages of value and importance, and not availed of. The fact that the alternative rate had tied to it a provision which, if tested, might be found to be void, is not material in a case where no effort was made to take advantage of it.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL CO. v.

E. 516) affirmed a judgment of the trial court against the Western Union Telegraph Company for damages resulting from negligent delay in delivering an intrastate message sent November 17 [October 2], 1918. Its telegraph system was at that time in the exclusive possession and control of the government, and was being operated by the Postmaster General pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress of July 16, 1918, c. 154, 40 Stat. 904, and the proclamation of the President of July 22, 1918, 40 Stat. 1807. The state court declared that while the action and the judgment recovered therein were in form against the Western Union Telegraph Company, yet, in effect, they were against the Postmaster General; that in suing the company the plaintiff had pursued the course directed by the President's proclamation and confirmed by the contract dated October 9, 1918, between the Postmaster General and the company concerning compensation; and that since under this contract the Postmaster General would have to pay any judgment rendered against the company, the entry of judgment would not deprive it of property without due process of law. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n253 U.S. 480\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 482. Whether the company can be held liable is the only question presented here.\n Our decision must depend primarily upon the authority conferred by Congress in the joint resolution which provided:- \n\n[256 U.S. 662, 664]\n\u00a0\n 'That the President during the continuance of the present war is authorized and empowered, whenever he shall deem it necessary for the national security or defense, to supervise or to take possession and assume control of any telegraph, telephone, marine cable, or radio system or systems, or any part thereof, and to operate the same in such manner as may be needful or desirable for the duration of the war: ... Provided, that just compensation shall be made for such supervision, possession, control, or operation, to be determined by the President.'\n Under this resolution the President might, doubtless, have limited his function to mere supervision of the telegraph and telephone systems, leaving them in the possession and under the control of the companies. But the resolution also empowered him 'to take possession and assume control' of the systems; and this he did (Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163, 183\n, 185 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 507, 508 [63 L. Ed. 910, 4 A. L. R. 1623]), the proclamation declaring:\n'I ... do hereby take possession and assume control and supervision of each and every telegraph and telephone system, and every part thereof, within the jurisdiction of the United States, including all equipment thereof and appurtenances thereto whatsoever and all materials and supplies. ...\n\n'From and after twelve o'clock midnight on the 31st day of July, 1918, all telegraph and telephone systems included in this order and proclamation shall conclusively be deemed within the possession and control and under the supervision of said Postmaster General without further act or notice.' ...\n\n In conferring upon the President power 'to take possession and assume control' of the telegraph systems the resolution adopted language identical with that which had been employed in the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St.  1974a), pursuant to which the railroads were brought under federal control. See Missouri Pacific Railroad \n\n[256 U.S. 662, 665]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593, 65 L. Ed. --, decided June 1, 1921. We held there that the supplementary legislation known as the Federal Control Act did not impose liability upon the company, and that, since the Government was operating the property, the railroad company could not be held liable under the established principles of the common law governing liability. These principles are equally applicable here.\n In respect to telegraph systems there was no supplementary legislation similar to the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p); so that the argument mainly relied upon by plaintiff in the Missouri Pacific Case is not made here. But it is contended that the proclamation, the order of the Postmaster General of August 1, 1918, and the contract between him and the company concerning compensation authorized suit against the company as the operating agent of the government in the same way that the Federal Control Act authorized suit against the Director General. We find in them no basis for such liability. \n1\n Obviously neither proclamation, order, nor contract could create a liability not authorized by the resolution of Congress on which they rest. Nor did they attempt to do so.\n\n\n (a)\n The provision in the proclamation relied upon to establish the liability is this:\n'Until and except so far as said Postmaster General shall from time to time by general or special orders otherwise provide, the owners, managers, boards of directors, receivers, officers, and employees of the various telegraph \n\n[256 U.S. 662, 666]\n\u00a0\n and telephone system shall continue the operation thereof in the usual and ordinary course of the business of said systems, in the names of their respective companies, associations, organizations, owners, or managers, as the case may be.'\n\n This provision is in no way inconsistent with holding that the President took possession of and operated the telegraph systems as distinguished from taking over the companies and operating them. The companies were not made the operating agents of the United States. The officers of the companies were to operate the properties for the United States and it was to be done 'in the names of their respective companies.'\n\n\n (b)\n The Postmaster General's Order No. 1783, dated August 1, 1918, was of like effect. It merely directed that:\n'Until further notice the telegraph and telephone companies shall continue operation in the ordinary course of business through regular channels. ... All officers, operators and employees ... will continue in the performance of their present duties, reporting to the same officers as heretofore and on the same terms of employment.'\n\n\n (c)\n The contract of October 9, 1918, between the Postmaster General and the Western Union, did not purport to make the company liable. It merely provided indemnity. The provision relied upon is this:\n'The Postmaster General shall pay, or save the owner harmless from, all expenses incident to or growing out of the possession, operation and use of the property taken over during the period of federal control. He shall also pay or save the owner harmless from all judgments or decrees that may be recovered or issued against, and all fines and penalties that may be imposed upon it by reason of any cause of action arising out of federal control or anything done or omitted in the possession, operation, use or control of its property during the period of federal \n\n[256 U.S. 662, 667]\n\u00a0\n control, except judgments or decrees founded on obligations of the owner to the Postmaster General or the United States.'\n\n This provision is substantially the same as that inserted in the compensation agreement entered into between the Director General of Railroads and the railroad companies. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It is urged that telegraph companies should be held liable because otherwise those using the system would be without remedy for losses suffered thereby. Whether this is true, or whether under the Tucker Act ( 24 Stat. 505) the sender of a message would have a remedy in the Court of Claims or in a federal District Court, we have no occasion to consider in this case. \n3\n If Congress has omitted to provided adequately for the protection of rights of the public, Congress alone can provide the remedy.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This view has been taken also by state courts.

St.  8739]), which prohibited the movement in interstate commerce into any state of intoxicating liquor for purposes prohibited by the laws of such state, was sustained. It was held: (a) That the law in question was appropriate as a regulation of commerce; (b) that any want of uniformity which might arise in its operation \n\n[255 U.S. 336, 337]\n\u00a0\n caused from differences in the laws of the several states was to be attributed to such divergent state laws and not to any inherent want of uniformity in the act of Congress; (c) that it was competent for Congress, in regulating commerce as to the movement of intoxicants, to adapt its laws, as far as it deemed advisable, to the regulations prevailing in the several states; (d) that in regulating such commerce the authority of Congress was as complete as that which government possessed over intoxicants and was to be measured by the extent of such power, and not by the authority which controlled the power of government as to other subjects.\n In United States v. Hill, \n248 U.S. 420\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 143, there came under consideration an indictment for violating the statute known as the Reed Amendment (Act March 3, 1917, c. 162,  5, 39 Stat. 1058, 1069, [Comp. St. 1918. Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8739a. 10387a-10387c]), prohibiting the transportation in interstate commerce of intoxicating liquor into any state whose laws prohibited the manufacture or sale therein of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. Reiterating the grounds upon which the constitutionality of the statute considered in the Clark Distilling Co. Case was upheld, and additionally pointing out the reasons why the statute under consideration was within the authority of Congress to enact as a regulation of commerce, the indictment was sustained and the statute of necessity upheld.\n The decided cases in this court and in the lower federal courts which are noted in the margin1 make it certain \n\n[255 U.S. 336, 338]\n\u00a0\n that the Clark Distilling Company and the Hill Cases were accepted as determining the validity of both the Webb-Kenyon Law and the Reed Amendment.\n The case before us concerns an indictment found and conviction thereon had for a violation of the Reed Amendment after the decision in the Hill Case, and was brought directly here upon the theory that that law was repugnant to article 1,  9, cl. 6, of the Constitution, prohibiting any regulation of commerce which gives a preference to the ports of one state over those of another. We do not pause to consider whether the constitutional validity of the Reed Amendment had been in terms so completely settled by the Clark Distilling Company and the Hill Cases as to cause the contention here relied upon to be frivolous at the time the writ of error was sued out, but content ourselves with saying that, in any event, the want of merit in the constitutional question relied upon is so plainly and unequivocally established by the cases in question and the authorities which have followed them as to require us to do no more than direct attention to that condition and consequently to affirm the judgment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

REPUBLIC IRON & STEEL CO.(1921)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[257 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. A. Denson, of Birmingham, Ala., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Augustus Benners, of Birmingham, Ala., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by an employe against his employer and a coemploye to recover for injuries sustained by the plaintiff by reason, as was alleged, of his conforming to an order or direction negligently given to him by the coemploye and to which he was bound to conform. The injuries were sustained in Alabama and the action was brought in a court of that state. The employer's liability was based on an Alabama statute (Code Ala. 1907,  3910, cl. 3) and that of the employe on the common law. The complaint was in a single count and treated, the defendants as jointly liable.\n In due time the employer presented to the state court a petition and bond for the removal of the cause to the District Court of the United States, and the removal was ordered and completed. The petition was properly verified \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n as grounds for the removal stated in substance, that the amount in controversy exceeded $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs; that the plaintiff and the employer were citizens of different states, the former of Alabama and the latter of New Jersey; that the controversy between them was separable and properly could be fully determined without the presence of any other party; that the coemploye was a citizen of Alabama, and was wrongfully and fraudulently joined as a defendant with the sole purpose of preventing a removal of the cause to the District Court; that it was not the purpose of the plaintiff to prosecute the action in good faith against the coemploye, and the joinder of the latter was merely a sham or device to prevent an exercise of the employer's right of removal; that the plaintiff had brought an earlier action in the District Court against the employer alone to recover for the same injuries, and on the trial had taken a voluntary nonsuit because it appeared that he probably could not recover in that court on the evidence presented; that soon thereafter the present action, with the coemploye joined as a defendant, was begun in the state court; that the plaintiff personally and intimately knew every person who could by any possible chance have caused his injuries, and knew the coemploye was not in any degree whatsoever responsible therefor; and that, as the plaintiff well knew all along, the coemploye was not guilty of any joint negligence with the employer, was not present when the plaintiff's injuries were received, and did no act or deed which caused or contributed to such injuries.\n Shortly after the removal the plaintiff filed in the District Court a motion to remand the cause to the state court. This motion challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court on the grounds that one of the defendants, the coemploye, was a citizen of the same state as the plaintiff, \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n and that the removal was taken for the purpose of delaying the trial of the cause; but the plaintiff did not by the motion or in any wise traverse or take issue with any of the allegations of the petition for removal. The motion was heard on the record as it then stood, with an admission that the citizenship of the parties and the amount in controversy were as stated in the petition for removal; neither party producing any affidavits or other evidence. As a result of the hearing the motion was denied, because, as the order recites, the court was of opinion that 'the grounds of said motion are not well taken.' The plaintiff excepted. Then, on the motion of the employer, the court made an order requiring the plaintiff, within a fixed time, to pay the costs in the earlier action wherein he had taken a voluntary nonsuit, in default of which the present action was to be dismissed. The plaintiff excepted to this order and also failed to comply with it. After the time for compliance had passed, the court, conforming to the prior order, entered a judgment of dismissal,\n To obtain a review of the ruling on the jurisdictional question presented by the motion to remand, the plaintiff sought and obtained this direct writ of error, and in that connection the District Court certified that the jurisdictional question presented to and decided by it was whether, in the circumstances stances already stated, it had jurisdiction to retain the cause and proceed to a determination thereof in regular course, or was required to remand the same to the state court.\n Our power, on this direct writ, to review the ruling on the question indicated, although challenged, is altogether plain.\n Section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) provides for a review by us, on a direct appeal or writ of error, of the decision of a District Court 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue,' and then adds, 'in which case the \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision.'\n Whether a District Court, into which a case has been removed from a state court, may retain the same and proceed to its adjudication, or must remand it to the court whence it came, is a jurisdictional question the decision of which, where the jurisdiction is sustained,1 may be reviewed under that section. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 92, 96\n, 18 S., Sup. Ct. 264; McAllister v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 302, 305\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 274.\n Of course, the review can be had only after a final judgment. McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 118. But a judgment of dismissal, such as is shown here, is a final judgment. That it leaves the merits undetermined and may not be a bar to another action does not make it interlocutory. It effectually terminates the particular case, prevents the plaintiff from further prosecuting the same and relieves the defendant from putting in a defense. This gives it the requisite finality for the purposes of a review. Wecker v. National Enameling and Stamping Co., \n204 \nU.S. 176, 181\n, 182 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 184, 9 Ann. Cas. 757; Detroit & Mackinac Ry. Co. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, \n240 \nU.S. 564, 570\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 424; McAllister v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra; Colorado Eastern Ry. Co. v. Union Pacific Ry. Co., 94 Fed. 312, 36 C. C. A. 263.\n The jurisdictional question is all that is before us. The propriety of the ruling respecting the costs of the prior action is challenged in the assignments of error, but cannot be considered. The plaintiff was at liberty to take whole case to the Circuit Court of Appeals or to bring it here on the question of jurisdiction alone. He took the latter course, and by doing so waived all right to a review of the ruling on the other matter. McLish v. Roff, supra; \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Jahn, \n155 U.S. 109\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 39; Robinson v. Caldwell, \n165 U.S. 359\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 343; Hennessy v. Richardson Drug Co., \n189 \nU.S. 25, 33\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 532.\n A civil case, at law or in equity, presenting a controversy between citizens of different states and involving the requisite jurisdictional amount, is one which may be removed from a state court into the District Court of the United States by the defendant, if not a resident of the state in which the case is brought (section 28, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1010]); and this right of removal cannot be defeated by a fraudulent joinder of a resident defendant having no real connection with the controversy (Wecker v. National Enameling and Stamping Co., \n204 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 186 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 184, 9 Ann. Cas. 757). If in such a case a resident defendant is joined, the joinder, although fair upon its face, may be shown by a petition for removal to be only a sham or fraudulent device to prevent a removal; but the showing must consist of a statement of facts rightly leading to that conclusion apart from the pleader's deductions. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Cockrell, \n232 \nU.S. 146, 152\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 278. The petition must be verified ( section 29, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1011]), and its statements must be taken by the state court as true (Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Sheegog, \n215 \nU.S. 308, 316\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 101). If a removal is effected, the plaintiff may, by a motion to remand, plea, or answer, take issue with the statements in the petition. If he does, the issues so arising must be heard and determined by the District Court (Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 \nU.S. 430, 432\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 799; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Dowell, \n229 \nU.S. 102, 113\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 684; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Cockrell, supra, \n232 \nU.S. 152, 154\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 278), and at the hearing the petitioning defendant must take and carry the burden of proof, he being the actor in the removal proceeding (Carson v. Dunham, \n121 \nU.S. 421, 425\n, 426 S., 7 Sup. Ct. 1030). But if the plaintiff does not take issue with what is stated in the petition, he must be taken as assenting to its truth, and the petitioning defendant \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n need not produce any proof to sustain it. Kentucky v. Powers, \n201 U.S. 1\n, 33-35, 26 Sup. Ct. 387, 5 Ann. Cas. 692.2\n Here, but for the joinder of the coemploye, the case plainly was one which the employer was entitled to have removed into the District Court on the ground of diverse citizenship; and, if the showing in the petition for removal be taken as true, it is apparent that the coemploye was joined as a defendant without any purpose to prosecute the action in good faith as against him and with the purpose of fraudulently defeating the employer's right of removal. This is the rational conclusion from the facts appropriately stated, apart from the pleader's deductions. The petition was properly verified, and the plaintiff, although free to take issue with its statements, did not do so. He therefore was to be taken as assenting to their truth, relieving the employer from adducing evidence to sustain them, and merely challenging their sufficiency in point of law. We hold they were sufficient, in that they disclosed that the joinder was a sham and fraudulent, and hence was not a legal obstacle to the removal or to the retention of the cause by the District Court.\n The briefs disclose that the parties differ as to whether the local law gives any color for treating the employer and the coemploye as jointly liable-the asserted liability of one resting on a statute and that of the other on the common law. But we do not find it necessary to solve this question. As the joinder was a sham and fraudulent-that is, without any reasonable basis in fact and without any purpose to prosecute the cause in good faith against the coemploye-the result must be the same whether the \n\n[257 U.S. 92, 99]\n\u00a0\n local law makes for or against a joint liability. See Wecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co., supra, 204 U. S. p. 183, 27 Sup. Ct. 184, 9 Ann. Cas. 757; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schwyhart, \n227 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 250.\n In his motion to remand the plaintiff asserted that the removal was obtained for purposes of delay. But this had no jurisdictional bearing, no attempt was made to prove it, and it is not relied on here.\n We think the District Court rightly sustained its jurisdiction under the removal.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] If the cause be remanded the order is not open to review.

C., for appellants Winton and others.\n Mr. Guion Miller, of Baltimore, Md., for other appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals from a judgment of the Court of Claims rejecting claims for alleged services rendered and expenses incurred in the matter of the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation. The decision of the Court of Claims is reported in 51 Ct. Cl. 284. In the Winton Case (No. 6), a request for additional findings, equivalent to an application for rehearing, was denied, 52 Ct. Cl. 90. The appeals were taken under section 182, Jud. Code (Comp. St.  1173).\n The jurisdiction of the court below arose under an Act of April 26, 1906 (chapter 1876,  9, 34 Stat. 137, 140), and an \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n amendatory provision in the Act of May 29, 1908 (chapter 216,  27, 35 Stat. 444, 457). The former provided:\n'That the Court of Claims is hereby authorized and directed to hear, consider, and adjudicate the claims against the Mississippi Choctaws of the estate of Charles F. Winton, deceased, his associates and assigns, for services rendered and expenses incurred in the matter of the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation, and to render judgment thereon on the principle of quantum meruit, in such amount or amounts as may appear equitable or justly due therefor, which judgment, if any, shall be paid from any funds now or hereafter due such Choctaws by the United States. Notice of such suit shall be served on the Governor of the Choctaw Nation, and the Attorney General shall appear and defend the said suit on behalf of said Choctaws.'\n\n The original petition was filed October 11, 1906, by Wirt K. Winton, one of the heirs at law of Charles F. Winton, in behalf of himself and the other heirs and also in behalf of the associates and assigns of Charles F. Winton. Thereafter it was provided by the amendatory act that the court be authorized and directed to hear, consider, and adjudicate claims of like character on the part of William N. Vernon, J. S. Bounds, and Chester Howe, their associates or assigns, and render judgment on the same principle of quantum meruit; the judgment, if any, to be paid from 'any funds now or hereafter due such Choctaws as individuals by the United States'; Vernon, Bounds, and Howe were authorized to intervene in the pending suit of the estate of Winton, and it was 'provided further, that the lands allotted to the Mississippi Choctaws are hereby declared subject to a lien to the extent of the claims of the said Winton and of the other plaintiffs authorized by Congress to sue the said defendants, subject to the final judgment of the Court of Claims in the said case. Notice of such suit or intervention shall \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n be served on the Governor of the Choctaw Nation, and the Attorney General shall appear and defend the said suit on behalf of the said Choctaws.'\n Thereafter a second amended petition was filed by Wirt K. Winton, as administrator of the estate of Charles F. Winton, deceased, in behalf of the estate of Winton and also of Winton's associates and assigns. In this petition James K. Jones, administrator of James K. Jones, deceased, and Robert L. Owen in his own behalf, joined. Intervening petitions were filed by William N. Vernon; Chester Howe, who died pending suit and in whose place his administratrix, Katie A. Howe, was substituted; and several others.\n As shown by the findings the claim of Winton and associates arose as follows: By article 3 of the treaty of September 27, 1830 (7 Stat. 333), known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the Choctaw Nation of Indians ceded to the United States the entire country possessed by them east of the Mississippi river, and agreed to remove beyond the Mississippi during the three years next succeeding. But, in view of the fact that some of the Choctaws preferred not to move, it was provided in article 14 that each head of a family who desired to remain and become a citizen of the states should be permitted to do so, and should thereupon be entitled to a reservation of one section of land, with an additional half section for each unmarried child living with him over ten years of age, and a quarter section for each child under ten. If they resided upon said lands intending to become citizens of the states for five years after the ratification of the treaty, a grant in fee simple should issue; and it was further provided:\n'Persons who claim under this article shall not lose the privilege of a Choctaw citizen, but if they ever remove are not to be entitled to any portion of the Choctaw annuity.'\n\n By another article (19) reservations were provided for certain prominent Choctaws by name, \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n and for limited numbers of heads of families and captains.\n The mixed-blood Choctaws who elected to remain in Mississippi were provided for under article 19, while the full bloods who remained and elected to become citizens of the state were provided for under article 14; hence full-blood Mississippi Choctaws have always been called 'Fourteenth Article claimants.' Choctaws who remained in Mississippi under that article adopted the dress, habits, customs, and manner of living of the white citizens of the state. They had no tribal or band organization or laws of their own, but were subject to the laws of the state. They did not live upon any reservation, nor did the government exercise supervision or control over them. No funds were appropriated for their support, though much land was given to them. Neither the Indian Office nor the Department of the Interior assumed or exercised jurisdiction over them, and they never recognized them either individually or as bands, but regarded them as citizens of the state of Mississippi, and the Department held it had no authority to approve contracts made with them.\n Pending the negotiation of the treaty, the Legislature of the state of Mississippi passed an act, January 19, 1830, abolishing the tribal customs of Indians not recognized by the common law or the law of the state, making them citizens of the state, with the same rights, immunities, and privileges as free white persons, extending over them the laws of the state, validating tribal marriages, and abolishing the tribal offices and posts of power. Recognition of their citizenship was afterwards embodied in the state Constitution.\n The right of the Fourteenth Article Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the parent tribe appears to have been recognized at one time by the Choctaw Nation west, which had removed to Indian Territory pursuant to the treaty. \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n On December 24, 1889, the Nation, through its Legislature, memorialized Congress, reciting that there were 'large numbers of Choctaws yet in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana who are entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Choctaw Nation,' and requesting the United States government to make provision for the emigration of these Choctaws from said states to the Choctaw Nation. In 1891 a commission was provided for and funds appropriated by the Choctaw Council for the removal and subsistence of Mississippi Choctaws to the Nation, and during that year 181 were removed and admitted to citizenship.\n By Act of March 3, 1893 (chapter 209,  16, 27 Stat. 612, 645), Congress created the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, familiarly known as the Dawes Commission, with the object of procuring through negotiation the extinguishment of the national or tribal title to the lands of those tribes in the Indian Territory, either by their cession to the United States or allotment in severalty among the Indians, with a view to the ultimate creation of a state. By act of June 10, 1896 (chapter 398, 29 Stat. 321, 339, 340), the Commission was directed to make a complete roll of citizenship of each of the Five Civilized Tribes, and applicants for enrollment were to make application to the Commission within three months from the passage of the act and have the right of appeal from its decision to the 'United States District Court' (construed by this court, in Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 476\n, 477 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 722, to mean the United States Court in the Indian Territory).\n At this time the full-blood Mississippi Choctaws were extremely poor, living in insanitary conditions and working at manual labor for daily wages. Their children were not permitted to attend schools provided for the whites, and they were denied all social and political privileges. As already appears, they were receiving neither care nor attention from the Indian Office or the Department of the \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 380]\n\u00a0\n Interior; and they were so far overlooked by the Dawes Commission that the time limited by the act just mentioned expired without their being included in the enrollment.\n The activities of Winton and associates for which recovery is asked date from this point. Soon after the passage of the Act of June 10, 1896, Messrs. Owen and Winton entered into an agreement under which the latter was to proceed to Mississippi and procure contracts with such Indians as might be entitled to participate in any distribution of lands or moneys of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, arranging to secure evidence, powers of attorney, and contracts, as prescribed by Mr. Owen; Owen was to prepare the necessary forms and represent the claims of the Indians before the proper officers of the United States or Indian governments, with the assistance and co-operation of Winton; Winton to receive one-half of the net proceeds of the contracts. A supplementary agreement between the same parties provided in terms that Owen should have a half interest in the contracts, and in the event of accident to Winton should take them up as attorney in Winton's place. Immediately thereafter Winton proceeded to Mississippi, and during the year 1896 and the years following procured approximately 1,000 contracts with full-blood Mississippi Choctaws, some in the name of Winton, some in the name of Owen, by the terms of which Winton and Owen agreed to use their best efforts to secure the rights of citizenship for said Mississippi Choctaws, as members of the Choctaw Nation, in the lands and funds of said tribe, for a fee of one-half the net interest of each allottee in any allotment thereafter secured. These contracts were subsequently abandoned by Owen and Winton because void and unenforceable under the Acts of June 28, 1898, and May 31, 1900, referred to below, and new contracts were thereafter taken, principally in the name of Charles S. Daley, but in behalf \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 381]\n\u00a0\n of Owen and Winton, with whom Daley was associated. These contracts recognized the previous services of Winton and associates as beneficial to the Indians, employed Daley and associates, including Winton and associates, as attorneys to look out for, protect, defend, and secure the interest of the Indians in the lands in Indian Territory to which they might be entitled as Mississippi Choctaws or as members of the Choctaw Nation, and to procure the recognition of their rights in said lands and in and to any funds arising from the Choctaw-Chickasaw lands, and provided that as compensation for all services rendered and to be rendered the attorneys should receive a sum of money equal to one-half of the value of the net recovery, based upon the actual value of the lands recovered. They seem to have contained other provisions looking to the sale or incumbrance, in part at least, of the lands secured for the Indians. The validity of these contracts has not been discussed.\n Early in 1897 Mr. Owen spoke to Hon. John Sharp Williams, then representative in Congress from the Fifth Congressional District of Mississippi, wherein practically all full-blood Mississippi Choctaws resided, calling his attention to the possible rights of such Choctaws to participate in the partition of the lands of the Choctaw Nation, at the same time submitting to him a copy of the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty, and calling his attention to article 14. This was the first time the matter had been called to the attention of Mr. Williams. Thereafter, and until March 4, 1903, when he ceased to represent that district, he was active in all matters of legislation concerning the Mississippi Choctaws.\n In December, 1896, Winton presented to Congress a memorial in behalf of Jack Amos and other full-blood Mississippi Choctaws, asking that their rights under article 14 of the Treaty of 1830 be accorded to them, and that they be provided for by enrollment either by the \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 382]\n\u00a0\n Dawes Commission or by a special agent under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In January, 1897, a second memorial in behalf of Jack Amos and 246 other full-blood Mississippi Choctaws being heads of families was presented to Congress through Winton, asking that they be enrolled so as to participate in the proposed allotment of Choctaw lands in Indian Territory; and setting up that by the true construction of article 14 of the Treaty of 1830, when viewed in connection with other treaties and laws and the history of the Choctaw tribe, the Mississippi Choctaws were entitled to remain in Mississippi as United States citizens and still retain the rights of a Choctaw citizen, except as to a participation in the annuity.\n In September, 1897, Winton presented a third memorial of like purport to the Secretary of the Interior.\n Prior to the presentation of the first of these memorials, and in September or October, 1896, Mr. Owen appeared before the Dawes Commission in behalf of Jack Amos and 97 other full-blood Choctaws residing in Mississippi, and attempted to secure their enrollment under the Act of June 10, 1896. The Commission refused, on the ground that they were not resident in the Indian Territory. Owen appealed to the United States Court for the Central District of Indian Territory, where the ruling of the Commission was affirmed. This decision was 'indirectly affirmed' by this court on May 15, 1899, in the case of Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 U.S. 445\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 722, where it was held that the legislation under which the judgment was rendered was constitutional, and that this court was without jurisdiction to review decisions of the courts of Indian Territory in citizenship cases except upon the question of the constitutionality or validity of the legislation.\n On February 11, 1897, a resolution drawn up by Mr. Owen was passed by the Senate, directing the Secretary \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 383]\n\u00a0\n of the Interior to transmit certain historical data and information respecting the rights of the Fourteenth Article claimants. This was referred by the Secretary to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for reply, and his reply, containing material supporting the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws, was transmitted by the Secretary to the Senate, February 15, 1897. Senate Doc. 129, 54th Cong., 2d Sess.\n About the same time, Mr. Owen made an argument before the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House in support of House Bill No. 10,372, intended to permit the Mississippi Choctaws to continue to reside in that state and still claim the rights of Choctaw citizens. A favorable report was made by the Committee, March 3, 1897 (House Report 3,080, 54th Cong., 2d Sess.), but the bill never passed either house.\n In the Indian Appropriation Act of June 7, 1897, however, the following provision was contained:\n'That the commission appointed to negotiate with the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory shall examine and report to Congress whether the Mississippi Choctaws under their treaties are not entitled to all the rights of Choctaw citizenship except an interest in the Choctaw annuities.' Chapter 3, 30 Stat. 62, 83.\n\n Following the passage of this act Mr. Owen appeared before the Dawes Commission in the interest of the Mississippi Choctaws with whom he had contracts. On January 28, 1898, the Commission made a report to Congress as required by the act last mentioned (House Doc. 274, 55th Cong., 2d Sess .), setting forth in brief the history of the Mississippi Choctaws and their then present condition; and submitting an elaborate argument in opposition to the contention that those Choctaws might continue their residence and political status in Mississippi as in the past and still enjoy all the rights of Choctaw citizenship except to share in the Choctaw annuities; \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 384]\n\u00a0\n declaring that in order to avail himself of the privileges of a Choctaw citizen, any person claiming to be a descendant of those provided for in article 14 of the Treaty of 1830 'must first show the fact that he is such descendant, and has in good faith joined his brethren in the territory with the intent to become one of the citizens of the Nation. Having done so, such person has a right to be enrolled as a Choctaw citizen and to claim all the privileges of such a citizen, except to a share in the annuities. And that otherwise he cannot claim as a right the 'privilege of a Choctaw citizen.\" The Commission further said that, if they were correct in this, still any person presenting himself claiming the right must be required by some tribunal to prove the fact that he was a descendant of some one of those Indians who originally availed themselves of and conformed to the requirements of the Fourteenth Article of the Treaty of 1830. 'The time for making application to this commission to be enrolled as a Choctaw citizen has expired. It would be necessary, therefore, to extend by law the time for persons claiming this right to make application and be heard by this commission, or to create a new tribunal for that purpose.'\n On June 28, 1898, Congress passed an act, commonly known as the Curtis Act, which contained in section 21 provisions for the making of rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes by the Dawes Commission, and among others the following:\n'Said Commission shall have authority to determine the identity of Choctaw Indians claiming rights in the Choctaw lands under article fourteen of the treaty between the United States and the Choctaw Nation concluded September twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and thirty, and to that end they may administer oaths, examine witnesses, and perform all other acts necessary thereto and make report to the Secretary of the Interior. ... \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 385]\n\u00a0\n 'No person shall be enrolled who has not heretofore removed to and in good faith settled in the nation in which he claims citizenship: Provided, however, that nothing contained in this act shall be so construed as to militate against any rights or privileges which the Mississippi Choctaws may have under the laws of or the treaties with the United States.' Chapter 517, 30 Stat. 495, 503.\n\n Public notice having been given in Mississippi as to the times and places at which the Commission would hear applications for identification under the above provision, one of the commissioners, A. S. McKennon, proceeded to Mississippi in January, 1899, with a force of clerks and stenographers, and there identified and made up a schedule of 1923 persons as being Mississippi Choctaws entitled to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation under article 14 of the treaty. The principle adopted was that proof of the fact that a claimant was a full-blood Indian whose ancestors were living in Mississippi at the date of the treaty was sufficient evidence to report his name as a Mississippi Choctaw under section 21 of the Curtis Act. This schedule, known as the 'McKennon Roll,' was subsequently approved by the Commission, who forwarded it with a report dated March 10, 1899, to the Secretary of the Interior. The schedule never was approved by the Secretary, and was attempted to be withdrawn by the Commission December 20, 1900; errors having been discovered in it. It was formally disapproved by the Secretary March 1, 1907. The Court of Claims finds that--\n'That work of Commissioner McKennon, covering a period of about three weeks, in identifying and making up said schedule, was interfered with and retarded by said Charles F. Winton, who endeavored to prevent the Indians from appearing for identification.'\n\n No explanation of this appears. At the same time it is found that Mr. Owen (who of course was associated with Winton) furnished to Commissioner McKennon a list \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 386]\n\u00a0\n of 16,000 Choctaw Indians, which aided McKennon in his official work.\n Because of material errors discovered by the Commission in the McKennon Roll, another party was organized and sent out by the Commission for the purpose of making a more accurate and complete roll of the Mississippi Choctaws under the act of 1898, whose hearings were commenced in Mississippi in December, 1900, resumed in April of the following year, and continued until the latter part of August, 1901.\n February 7, 1900, Winton and associates presented a memorial to Congress, praying that the treaty rights of the Mississippi Choctaws be so construed as to afford them the rights of Choctaw citizens without removal, or that they be permitted to have those rights determined in the courts. Congress took no action upon this.\n April 4, 1900, Winton and his associates memorialized Congress, requesting the following amendment to the Indian Appropriation Act then pending:\n'Provided, that any Mississippi Choctaw duly identified and enrolled as such by the United States Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes shall have the right, at any time prior to the approval of the final rolls of the Mississippi Choctaws by the Secretary of the Interior, to make settlement within the Choctaw-Chickasaw country, and on proof of the fact of bona fide settlement they shall be enrolled by the Secretary of the Interior as Choctaws entitled to allotment.'\n\n The act as passed contained the following:\n'Provided, that any Mississippi Choctaw duly identified as such by the United States Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes shall have the right, at any time prior to the approval of the final rolls of the Choctaws and Chickasaws by the Secretary of the Interior, to make settlement within the Choctaw-Chickasaw country, and on proof of the fact of bona fide settlement may be enrolled by the said \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 387]\n\u00a0\n United States Commission and by the Secretary of the Interior as Choctaws entitled to allotment: Provided further, that all contracts or agreements looking to the sale or incumbrance in any way of the lands to be allotted to said Mississippi Choctaws, shall be null and void.' Act of May 31, 1900, c. 598, 31 Stat. 221, 236, 237.\n\n The Dawes Commission thereafter required from all applicants for enrollment proof of descent from Choctaw Indians who remained in Mississippi and received patents for lands under the Fourteenth Article of the Treaty of 1830. This constituted a reversal of the principle previously adopted in making the McKennon Roll, to wit, a presumption that the ancestors of full-blood Choctaws residing in Mississippi had fully complied with the requirements of article 14. It resulted that only six or seven persons claiming as Mississippi Choctaws were enrolled under the act of May 31, 1900, although from 6,000 to 8,000 applications were filed in 1900 and the early part of 1901.\n On April 1, 1901, the second party, already mentioned, sent by the Dawes Commission to Mississippi for the purpose of making a complete and accurate roll of Mississippi Choctaws, resumed hearings at Meridian, Mississippi, and held continuous sessions there and at other places in the state until the latter part of August. The Court of Claims finds that during these hearings and the making of this roll the conduct of Winton and associates increased the work of enrollment and impeded its progress. Being advised by Owen and believing that the McKennon Roll was a finality and constituted a favorable judgment in behalf of the Choctaws whose names appeared therein, Winton and associates advised all Indians who had been previously enrolled not to appear again before the Commission for identification. Nevertheless, as already stated, 6,000 or 8,000 applications for enrollment were made, of which only six or seven were accepted under the stringent rule of proof adopted by the Commission. \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 388]\n\u00a0\n June 20, 1901, Winton, under advice of counsel, began taking new contracts with individual Choctaws living in Mississippi, in lieu of the previous contracts already mentioned. The new contracts were 834 in number, and embraced in all about 2,000 persons.\n March 21, 1902, while preparation of the identification roll of Mississippi Choctaws was still in progress, an agreement was entered into between the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and the Dawes Commission in which, by sections 41, 42, 43, and 44, it was proposed to fix the status of the Mississippi Choctaws. This agreement, after some amendments in Congress, was approved by Act of July 1, 1902, and ratified by the Choctaws and Chickasaws on September 25, 1902 (chapter 1362, 32 Stat. 641, 651, 652). It was under this agreement, known as the Choctaw-Chickasaw Supplemental Agreement, that practically all Mississippi Choctaws were enrolled and secured their rights to allotments of Choctaw tribal lands. Section 41 as signed by the parties did not contain the fullblood rule of evidence-that is, that fullblood Choctaws living in Mississippi should be presumed to be descendants of Choctaws who had complied with the requirements of article 14 of the Treaty of 1830. It permitted all persons identified by the Commission under the provisions of section 21 of the act of July 28, 1898, as Mississippi Choctaws entitled to benefits under article 14 of the treaty to make bona fide settlement within the Choctaw- Chickasaw country at any time within six months after the date of the final ratification of the agreement, and upon proof of such settlement to the Commission within one year after the date of such ratification they were to be enrolled by the Commission as Mississippi Choctaws entitled to allotment, but declared:\n'The application of no person for identification as a Mississippi Choctaw shall be received by said Commission after the date of the final ratification of this agreement.'\n\n While the supplemental agreement \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 389]\n\u00a0\n as thus proposed was pending in the Senate, Winton and associates presented a memorial to that body in behalf of the full-blood Mississippi Choctaws, reviewing prior legislation and praying that the provisions of the agreement then pending should be amended so that the full-blood rule of evidence should be established and the Mississippi Choctaws given time after identification to remove to the Choctaw country and longer time within which to make application. Senate Doc. 319, 57th Cong., 1st Sess. The memorial prayed that sections 41, 42, 43, and 44, which, it was alleged, imposed onerous conditions upon Mississippi Choctaws, should be struck out and plain provision made that persons whose names appeared upon the McKennon Roll, and such full-blood Mississippi Choctaws as might be identified by the Commission, and the wives, children, and granchildren of all such, should alone constitute the 'Mississippi Choctaws' entitled to benefits under the agreement; and that all of them who should have removed to the Choctaw-Chickasaw lands within twelve months after official notification of their identification should be enrolled upon a separate roll designated 'Mississippi Choctaws' and lands equal in value to lands allotted to citizens of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes should be selected and set apart for each of them, and that after a bona fide residence for a period of a year and proof thereof they should receive patents as provided in the Atoka Agreement, and be treated in all respects as other Choctaws. An amendment embodying these suggestions was introduced in the Senate at Mr. Owen's request, submitted to the Department of the Interior, and adversely reported upon. Section 41, however, was subsequently amended, and as finally enacted (32 Stat. 651) established the full-blood rule as a rule of evidence, allowed six months after date of final ratification of the agreement within which applications for identification might be made, six months after \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 390]\n\u00a0\n identification within which settlement might be made within the Choctaw- Chickasaw country, and one year after identification for making proof of such settlement of the Commission.\n The passage of the Act of July 1, 1902, as thus amended, was opposed by Mr. Owen and the associates of Winton, who protested against the conditions contained in the amended sections relating to the Mississippi Choctaws as finally adopted.\n The Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1903 (chapter 994, 32 Stat. 982, 997), contained the following:\n'That the sum of twenty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as is necessary, is hereby appropriated, to be immediately available, for the purpose of aiding indigent and identified fullblood Mississippi Choctaws to remove to the Indian Territory, to be expended at the discretion and under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The special disbursing agent of the Dawes Commission was sent to Mississippi to carry out this provision. He there organized parties and assembled all Indians who could be found and induced to come, and they were later transported by special trains to Indian Territory and there further maintained until placed upon allotments, and supplied with tools and other equipment and rations for six months, all at the expense of the United States. The total number thus transported, maintained, and equipped was 420.\n The Dawes Commission received applications from approximately 25,000 persons for enrollment as Mississippi Choctaws. Of this number 2,534 were identified by the Commission; but of these 956 failed to remove to Indian Territory or submit proof of their removal and settlement within the time prescribed by law. The total number of applicants identified and finally enrolled and who have received allotments as members of the Choctaw Nation is 1,578, of whom only 833 appear on the McKennon Roll, \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 391]\n\u00a0\n and only 696 had codntracts with Winton and his associates. 181 Mississippi Choctaws had voluntarily removed to the territory in 1891 and were received into the Choctaw Nation. These were carried on the rolls as Mississippi Choctaws, making the total enrollment 1,759; but the 181 Indians just mentioned were not regarded as defendants in this proceeding.\n The funds derived from sales of allotted lands of enrolled Mississippi Choctaws subject to the restrictions upon alienation prescribed by section 1 of the Act of May 27, 1908 (chapter 199, 35 Stat. 312) are held by the government to the credit of the individual Indians entitled thereto. All other funds belonging to enrolled Mississippi Choctaws are held as tribal funds, the names being carried on a separate roll.\n As we construe the jurisdictional acts under which these claims were submitted to the Court of Claims, they contemplate not an action in personam to establish a personal liability against individual Indians, or a group of Indians, but a suit of an equitable nature against that class of Mississippi Choctaws who, through successful assertion of the right of citizenship in the Choctaw Nation, acquired allotments of lands in what formerly was the tribal domain, and a participation in funds held in trust by the United states; a suit having the object of imposing an equitable charge upon their funds and lands for a reasonable and proportionate contribution towards the value of services rendered and expenses incurred by the claimants in securing for said class of Indians a beneficial participation in the trust estate, according to the principle applied in Trustees v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n, 532, et seq., and Central Railroad v. Pettus, \n113 U.S. 116\n, 122-127, 5 Sup. Ct. 387. The present suit is of that nature.\n It is thoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full power to legislate concerning their tribal property. \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 392]\n\u00a0\n The guardianship arises from their condition of tutelage or dependency; and it rests with Congress to determine when the relationship shall cease; the mere grant of rights of citizenship not being sufficient to terminate it. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 553\n, 564, et seq., 23 Sup. Ct. 216; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 U.S. 286\n, 310-316, 31 Sup. Ct. 578. In authorizing the present suit Congress evidently recognized that it was impracticable to bring before the court all interested individual Choctaws; hence, treating them as a class, it designated the representatives who should defend for them, by analogy to the familiar practice in equity, recognized in Equity Rule 38 (\n226 U.S. 659\n, 33 Sup. Ct. xxix). To the objection that the government's trusteeship of the funds of these Indians and its guardianship over their interests in the allotted lands made it necessary that the United States should be a party to the proceeding, it is sufficient to say that the regulation of this matter is clearly within the power of Congress, and that Congress acted within that power in constituting the Governor of the Choctaw Nation the representative of the defendants upon whom notice of the suit was to be served in their behalf, and designating the Attorney General of the United States as their attorney to appear and defend the suit. We are clear, therefore, that there is no substantial basis for the contention that the jurisdictional acts have the effect of depriving the Indians of their property without due process of law, and hence are in conflict with the Fifth Amendment, a contention which, while overruled by a majority of the Court of Claims, was acceded to by the Chief Justice in a concurring opinion. 51 Ct. Cl. 324-327.\n The claim of Winton, Owen, and associates, is based wholly upon services rendered-nothing being asked because of expenses incurred or moneys disbursed. According to the findings the services rendered were in the nature of professional services before Congress and its committees, individual Representatives and Senators, the \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 393]\n\u00a0\n Dawes Commission, etc., intended to establish the right of the Mississippi Choctaws to participation in the material benefits of citizenship in the Choctaw Nation, and to secure such legislation by Congress as might be needed for the practical attainment of the object sought. The findings render it clear that services of this nature, altogether proper in character-not lobbying, in the odious sense-were rendered by these claimants under particular employment by many individual Mississippi Choctaws, but with the object, incidentally, of benefiting the Mississippi Choctaws as a class, because only so could the clients of the claimants be benefited. We make no doubt that, for proper professional services rendered and expenses incurred in promoting legislation that has for its object and effect the rescue of substantial property interests for a class of beneficiaries under a trust of a public nature, it is equitable to impose a charge for reimbursement and compensation upon the interests of those beneficiaries who receive the benefit, the same as if a like result had been reached through successful litigation in the courts. In either case there is the same curious analogy to the salvage services of the maritime law; and, while it may be more difficult to weigh the effect of a service rendered in promoting legislation and to estimate its value than in a case of successful litigation, we think the principle of Trustees v. Greenough and Central Railroad v. Pettus applies in the one case as in the other.\n The fact that in the present case the services were rendered under contracts with particular Indians, whether valid or invalid, is no obstacle to a recovery. Services not gratuitous, and neither mala in se nor mala prohibita, rendered under a contract that is invalid or unenforceable, may furnish a basis for an implied or constructive contract to pay their reasonable value. King v. Brown, 2 Hill (N. Y.) 485, 487; Erben v. Lorillard, 19 N. Y. 299, 302; Smith v. Administrators of Smith, 28 N. J. Law, 208, 218, 78 Am. Dec. 49; \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 394]\n\u00a0\n McElroy v. Ludlum, 32 N. J. Eq. 828, 833; Gay v. Mooney, Adm'r, 67 N. J. Law, 27, 687, 50 Atl. 596, 52 Atl. 1131; Gray v. N. Y. Central & Hudson River R. R. Co., 161 App. Div. (N. Y. 924, 932, 145 N. Y. Supp. 1125, affirmed \n239 \nU.S. 583, 587\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 176.\n And assuming the last set of contracts made by Winton and Owen with the Mississippi Choctaws (including the Daley contracts) be regarded as valid, they still do not create an obstacle to the present suit. As between the claimants and their own clients, the existence of valid express contracts would bar recovery upon an implied contract. But there was no privity between claimants and the Mississippi Choctaws as a class, no contract having been made with them in their aggregate capacity and the individual contracts not including all members of the class. Under the equitable doctrine that we hold applicable, claimants, having substantially performed the agreements, might demand compensation under them as against their own clients, and the latter would then be entitled to a ratable contribution upon the basis of a quantum meruit from their fellow beneficiaries whose interests in the trust estate were secured and rendered available through the services of claimants. And by way of avoiding circuity of action the equitable proceeding may well be brought, as it has been brought, by claimants directly against the beneficiaries of the trust; claimants waiving, as they must, any right to recover under the contracts the measure of compensation prescribed therein. Hence, whether valid or invalid, the contracts are important merely as they show that claimants were not intermeddlers, but were employed by large numbers of Mississippi Choctaws, members of the benefited class, and that their services were not intended to be gratuitous.\n But, in order that there may be an equitable charge in such a case, it is essential that the services rendered shall have been substantially instrumental in producing a result beneficial to the class of cestuis que trustent upon whose \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 395]\n\u00a0\n interests the charge is to be imposed. And while from the facts found it is altogether probable that the services of Winton and associates did materially conduce to bring about a result beneficial to the Mississippi Choctaws by furthering the measures of legislation and administration that were needed to give them a participation in the lands and funds of the Choctaw Nation, there is no specific finding of fact upon that subject. If, from the circumstantial facts as found, it followed as a necessary inference that the services did materially contribute to produce the effect indicated, it might be held that the ultimate fact resulted as a conclusion of law. See United States v. Pugh, \n99 U.S. 265\n, 269-272. But the facts as found are inconclusive respecting the crucial point. Some of the services set forth in the findings clearly tended to produce a beneficial result; but there were others having apparently a contrary tendency. The interference by Winton with the work of Commissioner McKennon in making up his roll, and with the work of the second party in making identifications; the insistence before Congress upon measures for granting to the Mississippi Choctaws the rights of citizenship in the Nation while retaining their residence in Mississippi; and the opposition to the passage of the Act of July 1, 1902, in its final form-may be mentioned. However reasonable and well-intended these acts on the part of the claimants may have been-attributable as probably they were to zeal in the interests of the Indians-it cannot be said to be free from doubt that the efforts of claimants, taken as a whole, advanced the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws as a class to citizenship in the Nation and constituted a material factor in producing the ultimate advantageous result.\n But there were requests for additional findings, directed to the very point upon which findings are wanting. These requests were preferred under rules 90-95, but were filed more than the prescribed sixty days after judgment. The \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 396]\n\u00a0\n court in its discretion might have rejected them on this ground. Not doing this, however, it passed upon the merits of the requests, as was reasonable in a case so important and so complicated; and since, from the reasons given for rejecting them, it appears that the court to some extent misapprehended the nature of the main issue, and the bearing of the requested findings thereon, it cannot be said that had it not done so it would have rejected the requests because not filed in due season.\n Many of the requests, while suggestive of matters that might well have been included in the findings, either are not framed with sufficient definiteness to enable us to say that there was error in rejecting them, or are objectionable for other reasons. But those here stated ought to have been acceded to:\n XXIX-R (52 Ct. Cl. 128): 'Whether or not the labor of Robert L. Owen in behalf of the rights of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation, from July, 1896, to 1906, resulted in any benefit or value whatever to the Mississippi Choctaws.'\n XXXI-E (52 Ct. Cl. 130): 'Whether or not the 1,643 Mississippi Choctaws who were admitted to citizenship in and received allotments as members of the Choctaw Nation obtained the right to become such citizens and thereby receive allotments as a result to any extent whatever of any of the labor and work done by Robert L. Owen and associates during the period of several years prior to the passage of the acts under which they were enrolled and allotted; and what compensation is equitable or justly due therefor on the principle of quantum meruit as required by the jurisdictional act in this case.'\n The reasons given for the rejection of these requests are not satisfactory; and for failure to make findings in response thereto, the judgment in the case of Winton and associates, No. 6, must be reversed, and the cause remanded for additional findings as requested. \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 397]\n\u00a0\n The claim in No. 12, Katie A. Howe, executrix of Chester Howe, deceased, like the one we have been discussing, is based upon alleged legal services rendered before Congress and the Interior Department in representing and protecting the interests of the Mississippi Choctaws and establishing their rights in and to lands in the Choctaw Nation. The findings show that Chester Howe, having acquired an interest in a large number of contracts taken by a firm of Hudson & Arnold, or the members of the firm, with individual Mississippi Choctaw claimants, having the object of securing the rights of the latter to allotments in the tribal lands of the Choctaw Nation and removing the Indians to the Indian Territory, was actively engaged for about a year and a half in pressing the claims of those Choctaws upon Congressmen and Senators, the subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the House of Representatives, the officials of the Indian Office, and the Secretary of the Interior. It is found not to have been established by the evidence that Howe's services were effective in establishing the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation, or that such legislation as was enacted, under which they received allotments in the tribal lands, was the result of his professional services. The vital element of a benefit conferred upon the Mississippi Choctaws as a class is lacking, and from what we have said it is manifest that the judgment of the Court of Claims as to this claim must be affirmed.\n In the other cases covered by the present appeals, viz. Bounds, No. 7, London, No. 8, Field and Lindly, No. 9, Beckham, No. 10, and Vernon, No. 11, the findings show no benefit conferred upon the Mississippi Choctaws as a class for which recovery can be had under the jurisdictional acts. The claims of Bounds, Beckham, and Vernon are based upon services rendered and expenses incurred in behalf of individual Indians. London did nothing to advance the claims of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizen \n\n[255 U.S. 373, 398]\n\u00a0\n ship in the Nation. Lindly and Field claim as associates of Chester Howe; it does not appear that Lindly performed any meritorious service for the Indians; Field was active in impressing upon Congressmen and Senators his views as to necessary and proper legislation for securing the rights of the Mississippi Choctaws to citizenship in the Choctaw Nation; but the extent and effect of such services do not appear, nor does it appear that the legislation finally enacted was the result of said services. In none of these cases does the record show any proper foundation laid for a remand for further findings. All these claims were properly rejected.\n No. 6. Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further findings of fact as above specified.\n Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Judgments affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWYOMING v. U S(1921)\nNo. 257\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1921\n\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Lacey and D. A. Preston, both of Cheyenne, Wyo., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for the United States.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to establish title in it to 80 acres of land and to the proceeds of oil taken therefrom. The District Court rendered as decree dismissing the bill on the merits, which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (United States v. Ridgely, 262 Fed. 675), and the defendants bring the case here.\n One of the defendants, the state of Wyoming,1 claims under a lieu selection, made in 1912, and the other defendants under a lease from the state, made in 1916. It is against the selection and the lease that the United States seeks to establish title.\n By the Act of July 10, 1890, c. 664,  4, 26 Stat. 222, Congress granted to the state for the support of common schools certain lands in place (sections 16 and 36 in each township), with exceptions not material here; and by the Act of February 28, 1891, c. 384, 26 Stat. 796, amending  2275, 2276, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  4860, 4861), the state was invited and entitled, in the event any of the designated lands in \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n place after passing under the school grant should be included within a public reservation, to waive its right thereto and select in lieu thereof other lands of equal acreage from unappropriated nonmineral public lands outside the reservation and within the state. See California v. Deseret Water, etc., Co., \n243 U.S. 415\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 394; Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 U.S. 367\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 333, 65 L. Ed. --. Other laws of general application (sections 441, 453, 2478, Rev. Stat. [Comp. St.  681, 699, 5120]) required that the selections be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.\n In 1907 a tract in place which had passed to the state under the school grant was included within a public reservation, called the Big Horn National Forest. On April 4, 1912, the state-through its Governor, Joseph M. Carey, and its Land Commissioner, S. G. Hopkins-filed in the proper local land office a selection list waiving its right to that tract and selecting in lieu thereof other land of the same area from public lands within the state and outside the forest reserve. The land so selected included the 80 acres now in controversy. At that time the state had a perfect title to the tract in the reserve and the land selected in lieu thereof was vacant, unappropriated, and neither known nor believed to be mineral. The list fully conformed to the directions on the subject issued by the Secretary of the Interior and was accompanied by the requisite proofs and the proper fees. Notice of the selection was regularly posted and published, proof thereof was duly made and the state paid the publisher's charge. Thus, as the Circuit Court of Appeals said, 'the state did everything necessary to show a perfect title to the land relinquished and perfect relinquishment thereof to the government, and everything that was required either by statute or regulation of the Land Department' in selecting the lieu land instead of the relinquished tract.\n No objection was called forth by the notice and in \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n regular course the local officers transmitted the list and other papers to the General Land Office with a certificate stating that no adverse filing, entry or claim to the selected land was shown by the records in their office and that the filing of the list was allowed and approved by them. The list remained in the General Land Office awaiting consideration by the Commissioner for up wards of three years. In the meantime, on May 6, 1914, two years after the selection, the selected land, with other lands aggregating more than 88,000 acres, was included in a temporary executive withdrawal as possible oil land under the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (Comp. St.  4523-4525). On April 29, 1915, the Commissioner, coming to consider the selection, declined to approve it as made and called on the state either to accept a limited-surface right-certification of the selected land or to show that it still was not known or believed to be mineral. The state declined to accede to either alternative and insisted that its rights should be determined as of the time when the waiver and selection were made and that, applying that test, it became invested with the equitable title to the selected land two years prior to the temporary withdrawal and at a time when that land plainly was neither known nor believed to be mineral. The Commissioner thereupon ordered the selection canceled,-not because it was in any respect objectionable when made, but on the theory that he was justified in rejecting it by reason of the subsequent withdrawal and subsequent oil discoveries in that vicinity. The state appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, and, on October 25, 1916, he affirmed the Commissioner's action.\n In the meantime, on May 24, 1916, the state had given to the defendant Ridgely a lease permitting him to drill the selected land for oil, and the lease had been assigned to the defendant oil company. There was no oil discovery, nor any drilling, on the selected land up \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n to the time the lease was given; but thereafter the oil company began drilling and at large cost carried the same to discovery and successful production. This was four years after the selection.\n The question presented is whether, considering that the selection was lawfully made in lieu of the state-owned tract contemporaneously relinquished, and that nothing remained to be done by the state to perfect the selection, it was admissible for the Commissioner and the Secretary to disapprove and reject it on the ground that the selected land was withdrawn two years later under the Act of June 25, 1910, and still later was discovered to be mineral land; that is, to be valuable for oil. Or, putting it in another way, the question is whether it was admissible for those officers to test the validity of the selection by the changed conditions when they came to examine it, instead of by the conditions existing when the state relinquished the tract in the forest reserve and selected the other in its stead.\n In principle it is plain that the validity of the selection should be determined as of the time when it was made, that is, according to the conditions then existing. The proposal for the exchange of land without for land within the reserve came from Congress. Acceptance rested with the state and of course would be influenced and controlled by the conditions existing at the time. It is not as if the selection was merely a proposal by the state which the land officers could accept or reject. They had no such option to exercise, but were charged with the duty of ascertaining whether the state's waiver and selection met the requirements of the congressional proposal and of giving or withholding their approval accordingly. The power confided to them was not that of granting or denying a privilege to the state, but of determining whether an existing privilege conferred by Congress had been lawfully exercised; in other words, \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 497]\n\u00a0\n their action was to be judicial in its nature and directed to an ascertainment and declaration of the effect of the waiver and selection by the state in 1912. If these were valid then-if they met all the requirements of the congressional proposal, including the directions given by the Secretary-they remained valid notwithstanding the subsequent change in conditions. Acceptance of such a proposal and full compliance therewith confer vested rights which all must respect. Equity then regards the state as the owner of the selected tract and the United States as owning the other; and this equitable ownership carries with it whatever of advantage or disadvantage may arise from a subsequent change in conditions whether one tract or the other be affected. Of course the state's right under the selection was precisely the same as if in 1912 it had made a cash entry of the selected land under an applicable statute, for the waiver of its right to the tract in the forest reserve was the equivalent of a cash consideration. And yet it hardly would be suggested that the Commissioner or the Secretary on coming to consider the cash entry could do otherwise than approve it, if at the time it was made the land was open to such an entry and the amount paid was the lawful price.\n The conclusion which we deem plain in principle is fully sustained by prior adjudications. In Benson Mining Co. v. Alta Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 428, 431\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 877, 878 (36 L. Ed. 762), which presented the question of when under the public land laws a right to the land becomes vested, it was said:\n'When the price is paid the right to a patent immediately arises. If not issued at once, it is because the magnitude of the business in the Land Department causes delay. But such delay, in the mere administration of affairs, does not diminish the rights flowing from the purchase, or cast any additional burdens on the purchaser, or expose him to the assaults of third parties.'\n\n And again (\n145 U.S. 432\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 879. 36 L. Ed. 762):\n'It is a general rule, in respect to the sales of real state, \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 498]\n\u00a0\n that when a purchaser has paid the full purchase price his equitable rights are complete, and there is nothing left in the vendor but the naked legal title, which he holds in trust for the purchaser. And this general rule of real estate law has been repeatedly applied by this court to the administration of the affairs of the Land Department of the government; and the ruling has been uniform, that whenever, in cash sales, the price has been paid, or, in other cases, all the conditions of entry performed, the full equitable title has passed, and only the naked legal title remains in the government in trust for the other party, in whom are vested all the rights and obligations of ownership.'\n\n In Colorado Coal & Iron Co. v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 307, 328\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 131, 141 (31 L. Ed. 182), a title obtained through preemption cash entries was assailed on the ground that the land was shown by subsequent discoveries to be mineral; but the attack failed; the court saying:\n'A change in the conditions occurring subsequently to the sale, whereby new discoveries are made, or by means whereof it may become profitable to work the veins as mines, cannot affect the title as it passed at the time of sale. The question must be determined according to the facts in existence at the time of the sale.'\n\n In United States v. Iron Silver Mining Co., \n128 \nU.S. 673, 683\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 195, 199 (32 L. Ed. 571), a title acquired through an application for a placer patent was sought to be annulled on the ground that subsequent mining disclosed that the land was lode land; but the title was sustained, the court observing:\n'The subsequent discovery of lodes upon the ground, and their successful working does not affect the good faith of the application. That must be determined by what was known to exist at the time.'\n\n Particularly in point is Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 U.S. 312\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 632, which related to what is called Baca tract No. 4. Congress had accorded to the heirs of Luis Maria Baca the right to relinquish their claim to a large body of land in New Mexico and to select \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 499]\n\u00a0\n instead 'an equal quantity of vacant land, not mineral,' in not exceeding five tracts in that territory. As here, there was no provision for a patent. The original claim was relinquished and the lieu selection made conformably to directions given by the Land Department, the selected land being represented as vacant and not known to be mineral. Afterwards the selection of a part of tract No. 4 was called in question on the ground that it was shown by subsequent discoveries to be mineral. This court sustained the selection and said (\n170 U.S. 332\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 641):\n'The grantees, the Baca heirs, were authorized to select this body of land. They were not at liberty to select lands already occupied by others. The lands must be vacant. Nor were they at liberty to select lands which were then known to contain mineral. Congress did not intend to grant any mines or mineral lands, but with these exceptions their right of selection was coextensive with the limits of New Mexico. We say 'lands then known to contain mineral,' for it cannot be that Congress intended that the grant should be rendered nugatory by any future discoveries of mineral. The selection was to be made within three years. The title was then to pass, and it would be an insult to the good faith of Congress to suppose that it did not intend that the title when it passed should pass absolutely, and not contingently upon subsequent discoveries. This is in accord with the general rule as to the transfer of title to the public lands of the United States. In case of homestead, pre-emption or townsite entries, the law excludes mineral lands, but it was never doubted that the title once passed was free from all conditions of subsequent discoveries of mineral.'\n\n In Leonard v. Lennox, 181 Fed. 760, 104 C. C. A. 296, a contention that an application for a nonmineral final entry, even if regularly presented and based on full compliance with the law, should be disallowed and rejected where the land subsequently is discovered to be mineral (coal) was \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 500]\n\u00a0\n overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, the court saying (181 Fed. 764, 104 C. C. A. 300):\n'This insistence cannot prevail. It not only is opposed to the settled rule that the character of the land-whether agricultural or known to be chiefly valuable for coal-must be determined according to the conditions existing at the time when the applicant does all that he is required to do to entitle him to a patent, but is grounded in a misapprehension of the authority and duty of the officers of the Land Department in respect of such an application. Whilst it undoubtedly is subject to examination and consideration by them, this is not that they may elect whether or not they will consent to its allowance, but that they may ascertain whether or not the applicant has acquired a right to its allowance-a right which is acquired, if acquired at all, at that point of time when the applicant has done all that he is required to do in the premises instead of at the time of its recognition by them.'\n\n The last expression on this subject in this court is found in Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 U.S. 367\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 333, 65 L. Ed. --, where it was held in respect of a state lieu selection like the one in question here that the Commissioner and the Secretary in acting thereon are required to give effect to the conditions existing when it was made, that if it was valid then they are not at liberty to disapprove or cancel it by reason of a subsequent change in conditions and that in this regard the statute under which the selection was made does not differ from other land laws offering a conveyance of the title to those who accept and fully comply with their terms.\n The Land Department uniformly has ruled that the states acquire a vested right in all school sections in place which are not otherwise appropriated, and not known to be mineral, at the time they are identified by the survey-or at the date of the grant where the survey precedes it- regardless of when the matter becomes a subject of inquiry and decision, and that this right is not defeated or affected \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 501]\n\u00a0\n by a subsequent mineral discovery. California v. Poley, 4 Copp's L. O. 18; Abraham L. Minor, 9 Land Dec. 408; Rice v. California, 24 Land Dec. 14; United States v. Morrison, \n240 \nU.S. 192, 207\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 326; United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 193. And as respects cash entries and entries under the pre-emption, homestead, desert land and kindred laws the Land Department always has ruled that if, when the claimant has done all that he is required to do to entitle him to receive the title, the land is not known to be mineral he acquires a vested right which no subsequent discovery of mineral will divest or disturb. Harnish v. Wallace, 13 Land Dec. 108; Rea v. Stephenson, 15 Land Dec. 37; Reid v. Lavallee, 26 Land Dec. 100, 102; Aspen Consolidated Mining Co. v. Williams, 27 Land Dec. 1, 17; Diamond Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236, 240\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 507. And this rule has been applied by that department, although not uniformly, to selections made in lieu of relinquished lands in public reservations. Thus in Kern Oil Co. v. Clarke, 30 Land Dec. 550, where a lieu selection under the Act of June 4, 1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 36, was under consideration, the Secretary of the Interior said (page 556):\n'When do rights under the selection become vested? In the disposition of the public lands of the United States, under the laws relating thereto, it is settled law: (1) That when a party has complied with all the terms and conditions necessary to the securing of title to a particular tract of land, he acquires a vested interest therein, is regarded as the equitable owner thereof, and thereafter the government holds the legal title in trust for him; (2) that the right to a patent once vested, is, for most purposes, equivalent to a patent issued, and when in fact issued, the patent relates back to the time when the right to it became fixed; and (3) that the conditions with respect to the state or character of the land, as they exist at the time when all the necessary requirements have been complied with by a person seeking title, determine the question whether the land is subject to \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 502]\n\u00a0\n sale or other disposal, and no change in such conditions, subsequently occurring can impair or in any manner affect his rights.'\n\n Again (page 560):\n'These established principles, in the opinion of the department, are applicable to selections under the act of June 4, 1897. The act clearly contemplates an exchange of equivalents. Such is the unmistakable import of its terms. In the case of the relinquishment of patented lands title is to be given by the government for title received.'\n\n And again (page 564):\n'It would be strange indeed, if by the latter \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 1897]\n\u00a0\n act, Congress intended that on who, accepting the government's offer of exchange, relinquishes a tract to which he has obtained full title in a forest reservation, and in lieu thereof selects a tract of land which at the time is vacant and open to settlement, and does all that is required of him to complete the selection and to perfect the exchange, should thereby acquire only an inchoate right to the selected tract, liable to be defeated by subsequent discoveries of mineral at any time before patent, or before final action upon the selection by the Land Department. Such a construction would not only tend to defeat the objects for which the act was passed, by discouraging owners of lands in forest reservations from giving up their titles, but would be against both the letter and spirit of the act. Parties would be slow indeed in relinquish their complete titles if it were once understood that they could obtain only doubtful or contingent rights in return for them. It could not have been the intention of Congress that parties accepting the government's offer of exchange should be embarrassed by any such conditions of doubt and uncertainty.'\n\n That view was repeated and applied in many other departmental decisions dealing with lieu selections. But afterwards the Secretary, conceiving that the decisions of this court in Wisconsin Central R. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 U.S. 496\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 341, and Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co., \n190 U.S. 301\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 860, justified him in so doing, ruled that \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 503]\n\u00a0\n no right attached under such a selection unless and until it was approved by him and therefore that, even though the selection was lawfully made, he possessed a discretion to reject it and give effect to an intervening change in conditions, as where a new claimant settled upon the land or sought to make entry of it while the selection was pending.\n Under this changed ruling the Secretary rejected several selections lawfully made by one Daniels and awarded and patented the land to others. Daniels then brought suits against the patentees charging that by the selections he acquired the equitable title, that his selections were rejected and the patents issued through a misapprehension of the law, and therefore that the patentees took the legal title in trust for him. Ultimately the suits came to this court, and after a full review the changed ruling of the Secretary was disapproved and Daniels' contention sustained. Daniels v. Wagner, \n237 U.S. 547\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 740, L. R. A. 1916A, 1116, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 40. The substance of the decision was that as the selections were lawful when made 'it was the plain duty' of the Secretary to approve them; that the contrary view found no justification in Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co., supra; and that the real authority and duty of the Secretary in dealing with such selections were pointed out in Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 387\n, 388 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 300, 303 (55 L. Ed. 258) where it was said:\n'The requirement of approval by the Secretary consequently imposed on that official the duty of determining whether the selections were lawful at the time they were made, which is inconsistent with the theory that any one could appropriate the selected land pending action of the Secretary. The scope of the power to approve lists of selections conferred on the Secretary was clearly pointed out in Wisconsin Central Railroad v. Price, \n133 U.S. 496\n, 511, where it was said that the power to approve was judicial in its nature. Possessing that attribute the authority therefore involved not only the power but implied the duty to determine the lawfulness of the selections \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 504]\n\u00a0\n as of the time when the exertion of the authority was invoked by the lawful filing of the list of selections.'\n\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals in the present case, like the Secretary in the other, regarded the decisions in the Wisconsin Central Case and the Cosmos Case as showing that no right attaches under a lieu selection unless and until approved by the Secretary, it is well to point out just what was involved in those cases; for it then will be apparent that there was no purpose in either to go to the length suggested.\n The Wisconsin Central Case was a suit to enjoin the collection of a tax levied on land which at the time was covered by a pending indemnity selection under a railroad land grant. The Commissioner of the General Land Office had reported that the company already had received indemnity lands largely in excess of the losses for which it was entitled to indemnity, and the company was disputing that report. Until that controversy was determined it could not be known whether the company was entitled to an approval of the selection. In that situation the United States had such an interest in the land as made it nontaxable. Whether the selection was valid or otherwise was primarily a question for the Secretary of the Interior to determine. Ultimately he held it valid, but not until after the tax was levied-indeed, after the suit was brought. The suit involved the validity of the tax, and nothing more. Its purpose was not to control the action of the Secretary by a writ of mandamus of injunction, nor to determine the title as between the United States and the company or between the company and a grantee of the United States. True, the court, after commenting on the difference between the granted lands in place and the indemnity lands as respects the mode of identification, very broadly stated that an indemnity selection to be effective required the approval of the Secretary; but it was not meant by this that the Secretary arbitrarily could \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 505]\n\u00a0\n defeat the right of selection by withholding his approval, nor that if through a mistake of law he rejected a selection which was valid at the time it was made the company would be remediless. There was no occasion to consider those questions, nor could they properly be determined without the presence of parties not then before the court. And that the court did not intend its words to be taken so broadly is illustrated by the fact that it cited with approval the case of Saint Paul & Sioux City R. R. Co. v. Winona & Saint Peter R. R. Co., \n112 \nU.S. 720, 733\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 334, 341 ( 28 L. Ed. 872), wherein an indemnity selection lawfully made, but disapproved by the Secretary, was sustained against an adverse certification on the ground that 'this erroneous decision of his' did not deprive the selector 'of rights which became vested by its selection of those lands.'\n The Cosmos Case was a suit by a lieu land selector to establish his title as against others who were claiming under placer mining locations. The selection was not accompanied by proof that the land was not then occupied adversely, although that was required. Within the time prescribed by the regulations the mining claimants filed in the Land Office verified protests assailing the regularity and validity of the selection, setting up locations of the selected land made under the placer mining law prior to the selection and alleging that the lands 'were not subject to selection' because 'the same was mineral land and was included within' the mining locations. The protests were entertained and, with the selection, were pending when the suit was begun, which was shortly after the protests were filed. The suit was brought on the theory that by the selection the selector acquired 'the full, complete and equitable title' to the selected land, notwithstanding he had not submitted any proof of nonoccupancy, and that the protests were not such as could be entertained or investigated by the Land Department. That case and another (Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698), \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 506]\n\u00a0\n wherein a writ of mandamus was sought against the Secretary by another lieu land selector, were heard and disposed of as related cases, and the decision in one should be read in connection with that in the other. The full substance of the decision in the Cosmos Case is in the following excerpt from the opinion (\n190 U.S. 315\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 860):\n'Concluding, as we do, that the question whether the complainant has ever made a proper selection of land in lieu of the land relinquished, has never been decided by the Land Department, but is till properly before that department, the courts cannot take jurisdiction and proceed to decide such question themselves. The government has provided a special tribunal for the decision of such a question arising out of the administration of its public land laws, and that jurisdiction cannot be taken away from it by the court. United States v. Schurz, \n102 U.S. 378\n, 395. The bill is not based upon any alleged power of the court to prevent the taking out of mineral from the land, pending the decision of the Land Department upon the rights of the complainant, and the court has not been asked by any averments in the bill or in the prayer for relief to consider that question. For the reasons stated, we think the bill does not state sufficient facts upon which to base the relief asked for, and that the defendants' demurrer to the same was properly sustained.'\n\n There are general expressions in the opinion, which separated from the rest, might be taken as declaring that no right vests under a lieu selection unless the Secretary approves it; but that such a ruling was intended is refuted by the opinion as a whole, and particularly by the statements therein that the power of the Secretary is not to be exercised arbitrarily and that his 'decision of any legal question would not, of course, be binding on the courts' should the question properly arise in future litigation. The general expressions were relied upon in Daniels v. Wagner as interpretative of the decision and this court answered:\n'But we are of opinion that this \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 507]\n\u00a0\n interpretation of the Cosmos Case cannot be justified.'\n\n Besides, it was adjudged in the Daniels Case that a lieu selection which is lawful at the time it is made does invest the selector with equitable rights which he may enforce in an appropriate way where the Secretary through an error of law rejects the selection. And that ruling was reaffirmed and applied in Payne v. Gentral Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 U.S. 228\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 314, 65 L. Ed. --, and Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 U.S. 367\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 333, 65 L. Ed.--.\n The only exception to the general rule before stated respecting the time as of which the character of the land-whether mineral or nonmineral- is to be determined is one 45 L. Ed. --. railroad land grants. From the beginning the Land Department, by reason of the terms of those grants and the restrictive interpretation to which they are subjected, uniformly has construed and treated them as requiring that the character of the land be determined as of the time when the patent issues. In 1890 Secretary Noble, in declaining to disturb this construction and practice, pointed out the reasons which had led the Department to make a distinction in this regard between those grants and other land laws, and said:\n'This practice, having been uniformly followed and generally accepted for so long a time, there should be, in my judgment, the clearest evidence of error, as well as the strongest reasons of policy and justice controlling, before a departure from it should be sanctioned. It has, in effect, become a rule of property.' Central Pacific R. R. Co. v. Valentine, 11 L. D. 238, 246.\n\n In 1893 the matter came before this court and the construction and practice of the Land Department were sustained. Barden v. Northern Pacific R. R. Co., \n154 U.S. 288\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1030. As the opinion in that case shows, the court recognized that the mineral land exception in other land laws simply operates to exclude from sale, etc., 'land known at the time to be mineral,' and was careful to explain that its decision related to 'grants in aid of \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 508]\n\u00a0\n railroads' and to 'no other grants.' The grounds on which the decision was put were: (a) That the railroad land grants, besides being confined in the granting clause to lands 'not mineral,' contain provisos declaring in words or effect 'that all mineral lands be, and the same hereby are, excluded from the operation of this' grant; (b) that such grants, although expressly requiring that the question whether the lands are otherwise excepted be determined as of the time the map of definite location is filed, contain no such provision in respect of the exception of mineral land; (c) that it was well understood that many years would necessarily elapse between the filing of the map and the time when by construction of the road the grantee would be entitled to patents, and as the grants covered great areas, in one instance nearly equal to that of Ohio and New York, it hardly could have been intended to arrest mineral development in those areas in the meantime; (d) that such grants 'must be strictly construed,' and 'if they admit of different meanings, one of extension and one of limitation, they must be accepted in a sense favorable to the grantor'; and (e) that the long prevailing construction and practice of the Land Department ought not to be disturbed. Plainly the decision in that case is without bearing here, save as it recognizes that rights under other land laws are to be tested by a different rule. And this is emphasized by the fact that in Shaw v. Kellogg, supra, where the selection of Baca tract No. 4 was involved, the court distinguished the Barden Case, and applied the general rule before stated. And it is of further significance that this court has recognized that the legislation of Congress designed to aid the common schools of the states is to be construed liberally rather than restrictively. Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n, 526; Johanson v. Washington, \n190 \nU.S. 179, 183\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 825\n\n\n Of the executive withdrawal of the land two years after \n\n[255 U.S. 489, 509]\n\u00a0\n the lieu selection was lawfully made, it suffices to say, following the recent decision in Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 U.S. 228\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 314, 65 L. Ed. --, that the act of 1910, under which the withdrawal was made, is confined to 'public lands,' that by the selection this land had ceased to be public, and that the act could not be construed to embrace it without working an inadmissible interference with vested rights.\n It results that the Secretary erred in matter of law in rejecting the selection and that the District Court rightly entered a decree for the defendants. See Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 \nU.S. 456, 461\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 122; United States v. Detroit Timber Co., \n200 \nU.S. 321, 338\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 282.

CO. v. NICHOLS & CO(1921)\nNo. 216\nArgued: April 22, 1921Decided: June 1, 1921\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles N. Burch, of Memphis, Tenn., for petitioners.[ Yazoo & M V R Co v. Nichols & Co \n256 U.S. 540\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[256 U.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. W. Cutrer, of Clarksdale, Miss., and Frederick S. Tyler, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In November, 1917 the Yazoo & Mississippi Railroad Company issued to Nichols & Co. a bill of lading for 31 bales of cotton which had been loaded into a box car at Alligator, Miss., for shipment to Memphis, Tenn. Before the loaded car had been attached to any train or engine it was destroyed by fire. The shipper sued in a state court of Mississippi to recover the value of the cotton. The carrier contended that by the terms of the bill of lading it was relieved from liability. The provision relied upon was the second clause of the last paragraph of section 5 of the Uniform Bill of Lading, approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission June 27, 1908, and duly filed and published as part of the railroad's tariff. The paragraph referred to is this:\n'Property destined to or taken from a station, wharf, or landing at which there is no regularly appointed agent, shall be entirely at risk of owner after unloaded from cars or vessels or until loaded into cars or vessels and when received or delivered on private or other sidings, wharves or landings shall be at owners' risk until the cars are attached to and after they are detached from trains.'\n\n The shippers insisted that the provision did not apply, because at Alligator there was a regularly appointed agent, and that the second clause of the paragraph, like the first, was applicable only to stations where there was none. The shippers also contended, on the following facts which \n\n[256 U.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n were undisputed, that the place where the car was received was, in effect, a part of the carrier's terminal, and not a 'private or other' siding within the meaning of the above provision.\n The cotton had been loaded from the platform of a gin located at the blind end of a spur which leads from the main line at a point near the depot. The spur, which is 1,000 feet long, had been built by the railroad many years before at its own expense. About half of it is on the railroad right of way, and runs parallel to the main line; the rest is on private land. Under the contract for building the spur the landowner furnished free the right of way over his own land; but the railroad was to have full control over the spur, and reserved the right to abandon it at any time and remove the track material. The spur was used generally by the public for loading and unloading carload freight. The only track scale at Alligator was on it-as was also another gin.\n Each party requested a directed verdict. A verdict was directed for the shippers. The judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi on the ground that the clause in question applies only to stations at which there is no regularly appointed agent. 120 Miss. 690, 83 South. 5. In the appellate courts of the states in which the question had arisen the decisions were conflicting. \n1\n For this reason a writ of certiorari was granted. \n251 U.S. 550\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 219. The only question requiring decision here \n\n[256 U.S. 540, 545]\n\u00a0\n is whether the court below gave the correct construction to the clause. In our opinion it did.\n Whether goods destroyed, lost or damaged while at a railroad station were then in the possession of the carrier as such, so as to subject it to liability in the absence of negligence, had, before the adoption of the Uniform Bill of Lading, been the subject of much litigation. At stations where there is a regularly appointed agent the field for controversy could be narrowed by letting the execution of a bill of lading or receipt evidence delivery to and acceptance by the carrier; and by letting delivery of goods to the consignee be evidenced by surrender of the bill or execution of a consignee's receipt. But at nonagency stations this course is often not feasible. There the field for controversy as to the facts was particularly inviting and the reasons persuasive for limiting the carrier's liability. Local freight trains are often late. Shippers or consignees cannot be expected to attend on their arrival. Less than carload freight awaiting shipment must ordinarily be left on the station platform to be picked up by the passing train and lots arriving must be dropped on the platform to be called for by the consignee. At such stations the situation in respect to carload freight is not materially different. And this is true whether the car be loaded for shipment on the public siding or on a neighboring private siding, and whether the arriving loaded car be shunted onto a public siding or a private siding. There carload, as well as less than carload, freight, whether outgoing or incoming, must ordinarily be left unguarded for an appreciable time. It is not unreasonable that shippers at such stations should bear the risks naturally attendant upon the use. The reason why an agent is not appointed is that the traffic to and from the station would not justify the expense. The station is established for the convenience of shippers customarily using it. And the paragraph here in question \n\n[256 U.S. 540, 546]\n\u00a0\n was apparently designed to shift the risk from the carrier to shipper or consignee of both classes of freight. It does so in the case of less than carload freight by having the carrier's liability begin when the goods are put on board cars and end when they are taken off. It does so in the case of carload freight by limiting liability to the time when the car is attached to or detached from the train. But, at a station where there is a regularly appointed agent it would be obviously unreasonable to place upon the shipper, after a bill of lading has issued, the risks attendant upon the loaded car remaining on the public siding because it has not yet been convenient for the carrier to start it on its journey. It would likewise by unreasonable to place upon the consignee at such a station the risk attendant upon the arriving car's remaining on the siding before there has been notice to the consignee of arrival and an opportunity to accept delivery. The situation there would be practically the same whether the loaded cars were left standing on a public siding or on a siding to a private industry on the railroad's right of way, as in Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Railway Co., \n243 U.S. 281\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 287, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955, or on a siding, partly on the railroad's right of way and partly on private lands as in Chicago & North Western Railway v. Ochs, \n249 U.S. 416\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 343, and Lake Erie & Western Railroad Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n249 U.S. 422\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 345, when the siding is, either by state law or by agreement and in fact, a part of the carrier's terminal system.\n If we approach the construction of the second clause of the last paragraph of section 5 of the Uniform Bill of Lading in the light of this practical situation all doubt as to its meaning must vanish. It could not have been intended that at stations where there are regularly appointed agents outgoing loaded cars for which bills of lading have issued and which are left standing on a siding solely to await the carrier's convenience are to be at the risk of the shipper. And this is true whether the siding \n\n[256 U.S. 540, 547]\n\u00a0\n be a strictly public one, or a semipublic one as in the Ochs and Lake Erie and Western Cases, supra, and the case at bar; or whether it be a siding privately used but owned by the railroad as in the Swift Case, supra; and in such cases the fact that the spur extends over land not part of the carrier's right of way is immaterial. The construction contended for by the railroad, even if not applied to team tracks in the freight yards of a great city, would place all loaded cars arriving elsewhere at the owner's risk from the moment they were detached from a train, although the consignee had not even been notified of their arrival.\n It is clear that the immunity conferred by the last paragraph of section 5 does not apply to loaded cars on the spur here involved. Whether the same rule should apply to cars on strictly private industry tracks effectively separated from the terminal and exclusively under private control, like the industry tracks involved in Bers v. Erie R. R. Co., 225 N. Y. 543, 122 N. E. 456, we have no occasion to determine.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The clause was held not applicable in McClure v. Norfolk & Western Ry.

CITY OF CLARKSDALE(1921)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 6, 1921Decided: November 7, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. D. Minor and Charles N. Burch, both of Memphis, Tenn., and Blewett Lee, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Gerald FitzGerald, of Clarksdale, Miss., for defendant in error.[ Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. City of Clarksdale \n257 U.S. 10\n (1921) ]\n\n\n[257 U.S. 10, 14]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a controversy over the ownership of 250 shares of the stock of the Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway Company, a corporation of Mississippi. The city of Clarksdale acquired the stock in 1891, in consideration of $25,000 of bonds issued by it to aid in the construction of a new branch of the Railway Company in which it was interested. The certificate for the stock the city left in the custody of a Clarksdale bank. The Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway Company in 1892 was merged by consolidation in the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company. In 1897, the Pacific Improvement Company, a bondholder, recovered against the city in the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Mississippi a judgment for unpaid interest on the bonds amounting to $3, 058.13. Execution issued to the marshal who levied on, and took possession of, the stock certificate in the Clarksdale bank and at public sale sold the certificate and shares to the judgment creditor for $100, which was credited on the judgment. In 1898, the city made a compromise with the bondholders, by which, for payment of the principal of the bonds in cash, the bondholders released all claim of interest and transferred the unsatisfied judgment. No mention was made of the \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 15]\n\u00a0\n stock in this settlement. In 1904, the Pacific Improvement Company for $2, 770 sold the stock to the Mississippi Valley Company, an investment company, and transferred the certificate to that company. The value of the stock, which was little or nothing at the time of the judgment and the compromise, has greatly enhanced and is averred to be $75,000.\n By its bill in equity in the state chancery court, the city sought to compel the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company to recognize the city's ownership of this stock and to issue to it stock of the consolidated company in lieu thereof, in accordance with the terms of the merger. The Mississippi Valley Company after the answer to the bill revealed its ownership of the stock, was made a defendant and the real contest became one between the city and that company.\n In the pleadings and at the hearing the city attacked the marshal's sale as void under the statutes of Mississippi, and relied on the duty of the United States courts under federal statutes to conform their executions and sales to the laws of the state in which they are held. The state chancery court declared the sale void and granted the relief asked by the city. The state Supreme Court affirmed the decree. No opinion was filed in either court.\n We are met by a preliminary question of jurisdiction. The case was first brought here by writ of error to the state Supreme Court. Then within due time, a petition for a certiorari was also presented, and consideration of the latter was postponed until the hearing on the writ of error. Under which writ can the case be reviewed here? The Mississippi Valley Company relied below, and here insists, on a title acquired under an execution sale of a United States marshal. This is a title claimed under an authority of the United States. Under section 237 of the \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 16]\n\u00a0\n Judicial Code as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, chapter 448, 39 Stat. 26 (Comp. St.  1214), if the validity of an authority exercised under the United States is drawn in question and the decision is against its validity, review is by writ of error. If only a title claimed under an exercise of such an authority is in dispute, then certiorari is the proper writ. The authority of the United States marshal to make sales upon judgments in the United States courts and to give title thereby is not drawn in question in this case. What is denied here is the regularity of the marshal's attempted exercise of his conceded authority and the validity of the resulting title. Hence, the only way of reviewing this cause is by certiorari. Dana v. Dana, \n250 U.S. 220\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 449; Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58; Avery v. Popper, \n179 \nU.S. 305, 314\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 94. The writ of error is dismissed, the petition for certiorari is granted, and we now proceed to dispose of the case on the latter writ.\n The validity of the judgment upon which the execution issued is conceded. The questions to be decided arise on the levy and sale. On the 1st day of June, 1897, a fieri facias issued. This writ the marshal executed and made the following return on it:\n'Executed the within writ this the 13th day of Aug. 1897 by levying on and taking into my possession one certificate of stock, the property of said defendant, in the Louisville, New Orleans & Texas R. R., No. 147, for 250 shares, issued to the town or city of Clarksdale, Miss. Further executed on this the 6th day of Dec., 1897, at 12 o'clock meridian by selling said certificate of stock No. 147 after due advertisement by posting notices in three public places for the period of 10 days as provided by law, to the highest and best bidder for cash, before the western door of the United States courthouse and post office building in the town of Oxford, Miss., at which sale the Pacific Improvement Company \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 17]\n\u00a0\n became the highest and best bidder, at and for the price of $100, and at the same time and place I executed the writ of vendi exponas issued to me in this cause and offered for sale all the interest which the city or town of Clarksdale had in the capital stock of the Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway Co. or in the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, offering said interest at the same time with said certificate of stock to the said Pacific Improvement, for the said sum of $100, that being the highest and best bid offered for same.\n\n'Dec. 6th, 1897\n\n\n\n'[Signed] A. J. Cooke, U. S. Marshal.'\n\n On the back of the certificate the marshal inscribed the following:\n'Pacific Improvement Company v. City or Town of Clarksdale, Mississippi. No. 3900 Law. In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of the Northern District of Mississippi. By virtue of a writ of fieri facias issued in said cause, I levied upon certificate of stock on August 3, 1897, and thereon December 6, 1897, pursuant to said execution and to a certain writ of venditioni exponas, I in the manner provided by law sold this certificate of stock, all the interest of the city or town of Clarksdale in the stock of the Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway Company, to the Pacific Improvement Company. Witness my signature this the 6th day of December, 1897.\n\n'A. J. Cooke, United States Marshal.'\n\n Counsel for the city attack the sale chiefly on two grounds: First, that the levy was void because made on a mere muniment or indicium of title to the stock, the certificate, and not on the stock itself; and, second, that the sale was void because not made at the county courthouse, as required by the laws of Mississippi. \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 18]\n\u00a0\n In applying the laws of Mississippi to the validity of this sale, we are governed by sections 914 and 916 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as follows:\n'Sec. 914. The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceedings in civil causes, other than equity and admiralty causes, in the Circuit and District Courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such Circuit or District Courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n'Sec. 916. The party recovering a judgment in any common law cause in any Circuit or District Court, shall be entitled to similar remedies upon the same, by execution or otherwise, to reach the property of the judgment debtor, as are now provided in like causes by the laws of the state in which such court is held, or by any such laws hereafter enacted which may be adopted by general rules of such Circuit or District Courts; and such courts may, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such state laws as may hereafter be in force in such state in relation to remedies upon judgments, as aforesaid, by execution or otherwise.' Comp. St.  1537, 1540.\n\n Counsel for the petitioner also relies on the Act of March 3, 1893, chapter 225, 27 Stat. L. 751, which provides in its first section 'that all real estate or any interest in land sold under any order or decree of any United States court shall be sold at public sale at the courthouse of the county, parish, or city in which the property, or the greater part thereof, is located, or upon the premises, as the court rendering such order or decree of sale may direct' (Comp. St.  1640), and in its second section 'that all personal property sold under any order or decree of any court of the United States shall be sold as provided in the first section of this act, unless in the opinion of the court rendering \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 19]\n\u00a0\n such order or decree, it would be best to sell it in some other manner' ( Comp. St.  1641).\n We think that the language of this act limits its application to judicial sales made under order or decree of the court and requiring confirmation by the court for their validity, and that it does not extend to sales under common-law executions which issue by mere praecipe of the judgment creditor on the judgment without order of the court, and in which the levy and sale of the marshal are ministerial, do not need confirmation to give them effect, and only come under judicial supervision on complaint of either party. The sale in such a case depends for its validity on the marshal's compliance with the requirements of law. While the act of 1893 is not limited to equity and admiralty cases, its passage was doubtless chiefly prompted by the fact that they were excepted from the conformity sections.\n It is objected that petitioners cannot now rely on section 916 because they did not rely on it in the courts below. Their seventh assignment of error on appeal to the state Supreme Court complained of the refusal of the chancery court 'to hold and adjudge that whether the said act of Congress (i. e., the act of 1893) or laws of Mississippi governed the sale under said execution the validity vel non of said execution was a federal question, for even if the statutes of the state were applicable, the same became federal statutes by adoption under Act of Congress of June 1, 1872, U. S. Revised Statutes, section 916.' It seems to us that this submitted in the alternative with sufficient specification to the state Supreme Court the question whether section 916 of the Revised Statutes conferred validity on the marshal's sale.\n Section 916 gives to the judgment creditor 'similar remedies ... by execution ... as are now provided in like causes by the laws of the state in which \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 20]\n\u00a0\n such court is held, or by any such laws hereafter enacted which may be adopted by general rules of such Circuit or District Court.' This section was part of an act 'to further the administration of justice,' enacted by Congress June 1, 1872. The law of Mississippi applicable to this subject- matter, therefore, is the law which was in force at that date, unless the United States Court for the Northern District of Mississippi has since adopted by general rules later state law. We are not advised that it has done so.\n In 1872, the law of Mississippi as to levies on stock of a corporation was section 849 of the Code of 1871, as follows:\n'Bank notes, bills, or evidences of debt, circulating as money, or any share or interest in any incorporated company, belonging to the defendant in execution, may be taken and sold, by virtue of an execution, in the same manner as goods and chattels, or applied to the payment of the execution; and the clerk, cashier, or other officer having the custody of the books of the company, shall, upon exhibiting to him the writ of execution, be bound to give to the officer having such writ, a certificate of the number of shares or amount of the interest held by the defendant in such company, and if he shall neglect or refuse to do so, or if he shall willfully give a false certificate thereof, he shall be liable to the plaintiff for double the amount of all damages occasioned by such neglect or false certificate, to be recovered in an action of the case against him. The purchaser of such share or interest, at such sale, shall become the owner thereof, in the same manner as if such share or interest had been regularly assigned to him by the defendant.'\n\n We are not advised of any construction of this section by the Supreme Court of Mississippi, and we must therefore treat it as a case of first impression in determining the proper mode of levying upon shares of corporate stock under its terms. \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 21]\n\u00a0\n Taking the section as a whole, it classes bank notes, bills, or evidences of indebtedness circulating as money, and shares in an incorporated company together, and makes them subject to be 'taken and sold as goods and chattels,' or to be 'applied to the payment of the execution.' At common law, choses in action were not subject to levy as personal property. Here the legislative purpose appears to be to treat the written evidences of the choses in action circulating as money as in themselves capable of manual seizure by the execution officer, and, in appropriate cases, of actual application as money on the execution debt. The joining of shares of stock in this section with such choses in action indicates that the shares are to be regarded as in pari materia, and to be dealt with, as nearly as may be, in like manner.\n The elaborate and specific provision for a levy upon corporate stock of section 3467 of the Mississippi Code of 1892, which succeeded the Code of 1871, was, and was evidently intended to be, a departure from, and a substantial amendment of, section 849 in this respect. Under the later Code, provision for levy on bank notes, bills and other evidences of indebtedness is separated from that prescribing the levy on shares of stock. Shares of stock are no longer dealt with expressly as 'goods and chattels.' The officers of the corporation are no longer required to give a 'certificate' of the number of shares held by the judgment debtor to the levying officer, but are to make a statement in writing.\n The procedure provided in section 849, in our view, was intended to furnish to the levying officer a certificate of the shares of the defendant which the officer could manually take and offer for sale as the shares, and which, when indorsed by the officer with a record of his proceedings and sale, would work an assignment of the shares to the purchaser 'as if regularly assigned to him by defendant'; i. e., by the usual transfer of a certificate. If we are right- \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 22]\n\u00a0\n in this view, and the absence of any specific form for a levy in the section confirms us in it, then, of course, a certificate of shares issued to the debtor and found in the custody of his agent or trustee is the proper subject of levy and sale under the section. This statutory method of treating shares of stock and certificates for them as the same for purposes of levy and 'as goods and chattels' is not without parallel. People v. Grifenhagen, 167 App. Div. 572, 152 N. Y. Supp. 679; Mitchell v. Leland, 246 Fed. 102, 158 C. C. A. 329; Beal v. Carpenter, 235 Fed. 273, 148 C. C. A. 633; Puget Sound National Bank v. Mather, 60 Minn. 362, 62 N. W. 396.\n We think the levy was valid.\n Counsel for respondent criticize the recitals of the return as to a venditioni exponas and urge that neither ground nor time enough was shown for the issue and return of such a writ. Under the Code of Mississippi, as elsewhere, this is a writ used to compel an officer to proceed to a sale under a fieri facias, if any of the property taken remains in the hands of the officer unsold. The writ is not necessary to enable the officer to proceed with the sale unless the return day of the writ has gone by. With this exception, it gives him no authority not previously possessed. Reference to it in the return may well be treated as surplusage, not affecting the validity of the proceedings, if in other respects they are regular.\n The chief objection of respondent is to the place of sale, which was at the western door of the United States courthouse for the Western district of Mississippi in the town of Oxford. Counsel for respondent contend that under the Mississippi statute, the place of the sale should have been at the courthouse of Coahoma county at Clarksdale, the county of the judgment debtor, and where the certificate of stock was levied on, and that the sale at the courthouse of the United States where the judgment was entered and execution issued was void. \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 23]\n\u00a0\n The provision in the Mississippi Code of 1871 as to the place of sales on execution was as follows:\n'846. All sales by any sheriff or other officer, by virtue of any execution or other process, shall be made at the court house of the county, except when personal property, too cumbersome to be removed, shall be levied on, which may be sold at the place where the same may be found, or at any other convenient place, and also, except where cattle, hogs, sheep, or stock, other than horses and mules, are levied on, the sale of which may be made within the usual hours, on ten days' notice, at the most public place in the neighborhood of the defendant.'\n\n The Supreme Court of Mississippi has decided in Koch v. Bridges, 45 Miss. 247, and Jones v. Rodgers, 85 Miss. 802, 38 South. 742, that where land is not sold at the proper county courthouse, the sale is void. In Jones v. Rodgers the sale was by a United States marshal. It was made at the Statehouse in Jackson. A special Act of Congress of February 16, 1839 ( 5 Stat. 317,  1), provided that the United States marshal for the district of Mississippi should be authorized to sell property at the courthouse in each county, but that he might, at the written request of the defendant, change the sale to the place where the United States court for the district was held. The court, in the absence of any request of the defendant, held the sale void, saying:\n'Statutes fixing the place of sale of lands under executions are mandatory, and not merely directory; and it is the imperative duty of officers to make such sales at the very place designated, and a sale made at any other place is not voidable merely but absolutely null and void. The place of sale is the very essence of the sale and strict compliance with the statute is absolutely essential in order to transfer a good title to realty.'- \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The court cites other cases of land sales by United States marshals in support of this. Moody's Heirs v. Moeller, 72 Tex. 635, 10 S. W. 727, 13 Am. St. Rep. 839, in which the sale was at the United States courthouse just across the street from the county courthouse. Sinclair v. Stanley, 64 Tex. 72; Casseday v. Morris, 49 Tex. 613; Jenners v. Doe, 9 Ind. 461. Mr. Freeman, in his work on Executions,  289, vol. 2, says of these cases that although a view that such sales were voidable only would be reasonable, the weight of authority sustains them.\n With respect to goods and chattels, however, the sale at the place fixed by statute has not been regarded as so essential as compliance with the requirement that the officer selling them shall have the goods in view of the buyers, Freeman on Execution, par. 290, vol. 2; and yet the authorities are divided on the question whether a departure from this requirement renders the sale of personalty void. We do not feel called upon, however, to inquire and decide which is the better view, because we think that under section 916, in respect to sales of personalty, the federal courthouse was a proper place for holding the sale.\n Section 914 requires that the proceedings in common-law cases in the federal court shall conform to those of state courts 'as near as may be.' Section 916 gives the judgment creditor remedies on common-law executions 'similar' to those of the state court. These qualifying words recognize the necessity for some play in adapting the state procedure to the practice of the federal courts. Certain things must be changed. The officer issuing the writ of execution must be the United States clerk, the officer executing it must be the marshal, and not the sheriff, the name of the court must be different, and it is but a reasonable and obvious consequence that the place of the proceedings generally shall be at the federal \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 25]\n\u00a0\n courthouse instead of at the state courthouse. The inconvenience and danger of injustice to the judgment debtor in having his land sold at the federal courthouse, when it may lie at a great distance from there in a remote county of the state, furnish strong reason why federal and other courts should hold compliance with the injunction of the state laws as to the place of sale of realty indispensable to its validity. But in case of goods and chattels which after seizure and levy can be viewed by bidders as well at a federal courthouse as at a state courthouse, there is little ground for holding that such sales, like other proceedings under its authority, may not be properly carried on at the place where the court sits. The distinction between realty and goods and chattels in this matter is recognized in the provisions already noticed, of the act of Congress of 1893. The first section provides that the real estate must be sold either at the county courthouse in the county where the land is, or on the premises. No discretion is given the court to change the sale to any other place. The second section, however, while it directs that personalty shall be sold as provided in the realty section, vests full discretion in the court to sell it elsewhere.\n The case of Smith v. Cockrill, 6 Wall. 756, is relied on by counsel for respondent. That was a sale of real estate. The state law required appraisal before sale and a sale at not less than two-thirds the value thus fixed, both of which requirements were wholly disregarded by the marshal. The federal statute applying was the Act of Congress of 1828 (4 Stat. 281,  3), which provided that the forms of process, etc., should be the same as that used in the state courts. The requirement for appraisal of real estate and its sale at not less than two-thirds of the appraised value by a ministerial officer is much more important in protecting the rights of the judgment debtor \n\n[257 U.S. 10, 26]\n\u00a0\n than the place in a sale of personalty. The case of Bornemann v. Norris (C. C.) 47 Fed. 438, was also a sale of real estate, and, moreover, was a direct proceeding to quash.\n Nor do we think that the quoted language of the court speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley in Amy v. Watertown, \n130 U.S. 301\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 530, is in conflict with our view of the effect of these conformity sections. The question in that case was whether when the state statute provided that process could be served on a city, only by leaving the summons with the mayor, and there was no mayor, the federal court could order service to be made on some one else. The court held that under section 914, the United States courts were limited to the method of service prescribed by the state statute. In adapting a state statute as a guide to the conduct of the business of a United States court and its officers, service on a state municipal corporation specified by a state statute is a very different matter from the fixing of the place for performing the functions of the United States court and its officers. The corporation is completely the creature of a state, and it is usually within the function of the creator to say how the creature shall be brought before judicial tribunals. It was with reference to such a matter, that Mr. Justice Bradley said that the statute of 1872 was peremptory, and federal courts must conform to the practice of state courts.\n For the reasons given, we hold that the sale of the 250 shares of stock to the Pacific Improvement Company vested a good title.\n The decree of the Supreme Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","210":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYEE WON v. WHITE(1921)\nNo. 209\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1921\n\n\n\n Messrs. M. Walton Hendry, of Washington, D.C., John L. McNab, of San Francisco, Cal., and W. E. Harvey, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n The courts below denied petitoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus to secure release of his wife and minor children, who, having been denied admission upon their \n\n[256 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n arrival at San Francisco from China, were being held for return. 258 Fed. 792, 170 C. C. A. 86. He must be regarded here as a Chinese person first permitted to enter the United States in 1901 as a resident merchant's minor son, but who subsequently acquired the status of laborer and as such entitled to remain.\n In respect of the parties specially concerned the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'The father of Yee Won died in San Francisco in 1908. In the latter part of 1910 Yee Won applied to the immigration officers at the port of San Francisco for an identification of his status. He was about to depart for China, and it was his purpose to secure such an identification as would secure his admission upon his return. He made no claim that he was a merchant. His claim was that he was 'a capitalist and property owner.' He was granted such a certificate and departed for China in January, 1911. He returned on May 29, 1914. He was then 33 years of age. He claims to have married Chin Shee in China March 2, 1911, and that a daughter Yee Tuk Oy was born to them November 28, 1912, and a son, Yee Yuk Hing, was born to them on November 2, 1913. These three are the present applicants to enter the United States. They were all born in China, and this is their first application to enter the United States.'\n\n The writ was properly denied unless as matter of law such a laborer may properly demand that his wife and minor children be permitted to come into this country and reside with him notwithstanding they were born in China and have never resided elsewhere. In support of such right United States v. Mrs. Gue Lim, \n176 U.S. 459\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 415, is cited, and it is said that the reasoning therein which permitted her to enter because a merchant's wife applies to the family of a Chinese laborer, who lawfully resides here. But that case turned upon the true meaning of section 6, Act of July 5, 1884 (chapter 220, 23 Stats. 115 [Comp. St.  4293]), which required \n\n[256 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n every Chinese person other than laborers as condition of admission to present a specified certificate. The conclusion was that the section should not be construed to exclude their wives, since this would obstruct the plain purpose of the treaty of 1880 to permit merchants freely to come and go.\n The treaty of 1894 (28 Stats. 1210) provided that--\n'The coming, except under the conditions hereinafter specified, of Chinese laborers to the United States shall be absolutely prohibited,' but this 'shall not apply to the return to the United States of any registered Chinese laborer who has a lawful wife, child, or parent in the United States, or property therein of the value of one thousand dollars, or debts of like amount due him and pending settlement.'\n\n Exclusion of all Chinese laborers, with certain definite, carefully guarded exceptions, was the manifest end in view, and for a long time the same design has characterized legislation by Congress. 'In the opinion of the government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof.' See Act of May 6, 1882, 22 Stats. 58, as amended by Act of July 5, 1884, 23 Stats. 115 (Comp. St.  4290-4302); Act of September 13, 1888, 25 Stats. 476, 477; Act of May 5, 1892, 27 Stats. 25, ( Comp. St.  4315-4323); Act of November 3, 1893, 28 Stats. 7 (Comp. St.  4320-4324).\n The special object of the treaty of 1894 was to secure assent of China to the limitation or suspension by the United States of immigration or residence of Chinese laborers. Prior to that time rather drastic legislation had undertaken to limit such immigration and residence. These statutes were 're-enacted, extended, and continued, without modification, limitation, or condition,' by Act of April 29, 1902 (chapter 641, 32 Stats. 176), as amended by Act of April 27, 1904 (chapter 1630,  5, 33 Stats. 428, [Comp. St.  4337]), and are now in force notwithstanding the treaty of 1894 expired in 1904. Hong Wing v. United States, 142 Fed. 128, 73 C. C. A. 346. This \n\n[256 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n well-defined purpose of Congress would be impeded rather than facilitated by permitting entry of the wives and minor children of Chinamen who first came after the ratification of the treaty, as members of an exempt class, and later assumed the status of laborers. We think our statutes exclude all Chinese persons belonging to the class defined as laborers except those specifically and definitely exempted, and there is no such exemption of a resident laborer's wife and minor children.\n The judgment of the court below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n"}}
